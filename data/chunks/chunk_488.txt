 Traditional farming methods have remained mostly unchanged for centuries, involving planting seeds in soil, relying on natural sunlight and water, and waiting for the harvest season. Although there have been advancements in irrigation, seed genetic engineering and farming equipment, the fundamental approach has remained consistent. However, it is worth questioning whether this conventional method is the most effective way to achieve large-scale crop production. In Uttarakhand state, which encompasses diverse agro-climatic conditions including plains and hills, agriculture is primarily practiced in the plains. The main occupation of the people revolves around cultivating subsistence cereal crops in narrow terraced fields, resulting in relatively low yields. Additionally, horticultural practices involving the cultivation of fruits, vegetables, spices and flowers are also undertaken, but the proportion of land dedicated to horticulture is significantly less. In the present day, various emerging farming methods offer new possibilities for businesses in the food industry. We believe that hydroponic systems, particularly vertical farming, represent the future of agriculture. These systems enable the production of large quantities of nutritious fruits and vegetables in a sustainable manner, meeting the needs of a growing population. This article provides an overview of both soil and soilless agriculture systems. Hydroponic cultivation Diverging from conventional farming, hydroponics dispenses with the need for soil in cultivating crops. Within this innovative approach, plants are nurtured upon either natural or synthetic Indian Farming 8 September 2023 substrates, facilitating the rootsâ€™ efficient absorption of nutrients from a meticulously formulated nutrient solution. Various techniques exist for harnessing hydroponics to cultivate crops, their selection contingent upon variables such as the plant variety, prevailing climatic conditions, financial considerations and more. Typically, these systems encompass a reservoir for housing the nutrient solution, accompanied by an aerator. Water efficiency: Hydroponics is a soilless cultivation technique that uses up to 90% less water compared to traditional farming methods. This efficiency is achieved through recirculating water systems, where nutrient-rich water is continuously reused. Additionally, hydroponics eliminates water loss through evaporation and runoff, making it a sustainable option in regions with water scarcity. Nutrient control: In hydroponics, plants receive a precise and controlled balance of nutrients directly to their root systems. This allows for optimal nutrient uptake and reduces the risk of nutrient deficiencies or excesses that are common in traditional farming due to unpredictable soil conditions. The nutrient solution can be adjusted based on the specific needs of different plant varieties, resulting in healthier and more productive crops.
