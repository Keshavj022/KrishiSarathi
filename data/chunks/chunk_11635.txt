 Success stories of culture based fisheries in small reservoirs of Odisha The basic data on reservoirs, fish stocking details and fish catch information were collected for the year 2012-13 and 2013-14 from Department of Fisheries, Odisha, India to assess the impact of stocking of Indian Major Carp (IMC) i.e. C. catla, L. rohita and C. mrigala fingerlings stocked in 83 small reservoirs from 19 districts during 2012-13 and 2013-14. The stocking programme was implemented with the financial assistance from ST & SC Development Department, Government of Odisha. The mean production level of small reservoirs of Odisha increased significantly (P<0.05, t-test) from 32.46 MT during 2012-13 (initial year of stocking) to 48.69 MT (after stocking) during 2013-14. It was observed that the fish yield of small reservoirs under this program was increased significantly (P<0.05, t- test) from 204 kg/ha/yr during the 2012-13 to 323 kg/ha/yr during 2013-14. The per capita fish production was increased from 398 kg/fisher/year during 2012-13 to 702 kg/fisher/year during 2013-14. The visible change in per capita fish production was noticed in 200 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 Prestocking Poststocking Small Medium Large Yield (kg/ha/year) Fig. 1.

Impact of fish fingerling stocking in Indirasagar reservoir, Madhya Pradesh Indirasagar reservoir is located in Khandwa district at the heartland of India, Madhya Pradesh. The reservoir of Indirasagar Dam a multipurpose key project was built on the holy Narmada river near Punasa village. Indirasagar reservoir is the largest Mayurbhanj district. Culture based fisheries/stock enhancement in Chhattisgarh A total of 34 reservoirs of Chhattisgarh have been assessed for assessing impact of fingerling stocking. Highest fish yield of more than 300 kg/ha/year was recorded in Kirna reservoir. Fish yield increased significantly (P<0.05) from 48 to 160 kg/ha/year after scientific Fig. 3. Fish harvest using gill net from reservoir Fig. 4. Fish catch from reservoirs for marketing water reservoir with an area of 91,348 ha at full reservoir level (FRL). Impact of stocking was assessed for 14 years (2004- 2018) based on the data of fish stocking and yield. The fish yield increased from 1.1 kg/ha/yr (Stocking Density: 86 fingerlings/ha/yr) in 2004-05 to 43.46 kg/ha/yr (Stocking Density: 304 fingerlings/ha/yr) in 2017-18 due to adoption of fish stock enhancement strategy (Fig. 6). Recommendations and way forward â€¢ The carrying capacity of the water body must be considered while formulating stocking strategy as the fish yield potential varies from reservoir to reservoir and region to region.
