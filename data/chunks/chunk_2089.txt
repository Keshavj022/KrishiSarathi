 Apart from this, a motorized FRP boat of 10-meter overall length was also given to the society by ICAR-CIFRI. The main objective was to improve the livelihood of the dam-affected tribal population through a fisheries enhancement programme. ICAR-CIFRI trained selected 14 tribal fishers from this reservoir at the Institute headquarters on ‘Reservoir fisheries management for production enhancement’ during 22-28 July 2022, before the initiation of the pen culture activity in the reservoir, following which a mass awareness programme was conducted at Ramrei village, Mapithel Reservoir site to raise the awareness among the fishers of reservoir fisheries management. Two ICAR-CIFRI Pen HDPE pens (100 m2 area) were installed in the reservoir with provisions made in the pen to adjust heights during the monsoon to prevent the escapement of fish due to flooding making it a climate-smart adaptation system. The pen culture of Indian Major Carps (IMCs) was managed by the society in PPP mode. Indian Major Carp Catla Labeo catla (18.28±0.23g), Rohu Labeo rohita (5.2±0.12g), and Mrigal Cirrhinus mrigala (5.5±0.08g) seeds were stocked in the ratio 2:1:1 at the rate of 250 fingerlings per square meter in pens (100 m2) in duplicate. The fishes were fed with pelleted feed (ICAR-CIFRI CAGEGROW feed) twice a day at the rate of 2-3% of body weight. The fish were raised for 5 months, from September 2022 to January 2023. The average weight recorded at the end of the culture period was 283.13±1.70g, 186.26±47.02g, and 116.00±0.87g in L. catla, L. rohita, and C. mrigala respectively. The survival of fish ranged from 80 to 88%. The specific growth rate (SGR) of L. catla, L. rohita and C. mrigala were 1.82, 2.56 and 2.03, respectively. The species- specific net fish production per pen was recorded as 2,601 kg, 898.8 kg, and 546 kg for catla, rohu, and mrigal, respectively. The harvested fish from the pens were released into the reservoir for reservoir fish production, will be resulting in livelihood support for the displaced tribal fishers of the affected villages. This technology was an eye-opener for the 370 fishers of the cooperative society which yielded about 8.1 tonnes of fish from two pens, which could ultimately produce 36 tonnes in a year from the reservoir with an additional average income of ` 24,000/fisher, (` 250/kg). The society is highly motivated by the technology demonstration and expects future livelihood return, which has been implemented for reservoir productivity enhancement.
