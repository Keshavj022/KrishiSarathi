 The segregation and inheritance of various traits have been studied, such as seed coat color, epicotyl color, flower color, and pod dehiscence. Of the characteristics evaluated, the white flowers and growth and indehiscence of the pod are typical of the domestic lentil. According to this, it is believed that one of the first traits selected by man was the indehiscence of the pod, in addition to the fact that the conservation of these characteristics was easy to preserve, due to the self-pollination present in some legumes. The size of the seed is a more complicated event to determine because regarding the lentils used in the cross, some had small seeds and others had large seeds. The F1 hybrids showed variations from large to small seeds, but the size of the large seeds of the cultigen was not reached [62]. On the other hand, seed hardness in domesticated lentils is controlled by a single gene present in Lens ervoides (Brign.), which is the result of crossing this species with Lens culinaris (Medik.) [63]. In addition to Lens culinaris subsp. orientalis (Boiss.) and Lens ervoides (Brign.), three more species of wild lentils have been grouped: Lens tomentosus (Ladiz.), Lens odemenis (Ladiz.), and Lens lamottei (Czefr.); these are used to create hybrids with Lens culinaris (Medik.) in order to explain the genetic origin of the traits present in this domestic species. The above was achieved through the construction of two 96-plex genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) libraries with a total of 60 accessions, where some accessions had several samples and each sample was sequenced in two technical replicates. With these data, an automated GBS was developed, and with which 266,356 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected throughout the genome; these were filtered and 5389 were used. Subsequently, a phylogenetic tree was constructed and four sets of genes were identified that corresponded to the previously mentioned wild species [64]. Therefore, it can be considered that the lentil as we know it today is the result of the crossing of different wild species, whose traits were selected and conserved by humans. 6. Lentils in Sustainable Agricultural Systems The lentil is an edible legume with great nutritional value and cultivated worldwide for its nutritional contribution. Its worldwide harvested area increased from 4.1 million hectares in 2011 to 5.6 million hectares in 2021, and during this time its production increased from 4.3 to 5.6 million tons (Table 1). Additionally, it is a nutritious feed for animals and contributes to the growing demand for forage [65]. Table 1. Lentil production and area harvested in 2011 and 2021 in major growing countries.
