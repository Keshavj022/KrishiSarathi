i/acre in 200 litre of water on the soil surface just after sowing as pre- emergence application to control weeds in sole maize crop.   Treat seed with Thiram/Captan 0.3% (3g/kg of seed) or carbendazim @ 2g/kg of seed for control of smuts, blights and seed/seedlings rots. Treat seed with chlorpyriphos (20 EC) @ 5ml/kg of seed against cut-worm in epidemic areas. Oilseed   For land remained fallow during Kharif, toria (RSPT-1 and RSPT-2), mustard or Gobi Sarson (GSL-1, GSL-2 & DGS –1) can be sown in September @ 2kg/acre of seed if sown alone & 1kg/ acre under mixed cropping. Horticulture   In Jammu district, the cracking problem is quite common in litchi, citrus and grape fruits. Frequent irrigations, spraying of zinc sulphate (1.5%) at weekly intervals or spraying of GA3 @ 40 ppm is recommended. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 17   For runner production in strawberry, 50% shade is recommended for Chandler, Gorella and Oso Grand cultivars whereas 75% shading is most suitable for Belrubi cultivars. Vegetables  In intermediate lower zone, nursery of Brinjal (Pusa Purple Long, Pusa Purple Cluster, Pusa Purple Round); Chillies (NP-46 A, PusaJwala) in sub-tropical zone, Cauliflower (Pusa Deepali) may be taken.

Nitrogen should be applied in two equal splits doses i.e., first-at the time of sowing and second one month after sowing.   For leaf spot/blight and downy mildew of cucurbits, spray mancozeb 0.2% or copper oxychloride @ 0.3%. For fruitfly infestation in cucurbits, spray bait mixture (Malathion 1 ml + 10g sugar in one litre of water) @ 500l/ha. For fruit borer in tomato brinjal, and bhindi crop, spray endosulfan (0.07%) or carbaryl (0.1%) or Dichlorvos (76EC) (0.03%).   For management of fruit borer in brinjal, alternate spray of Profenophos @ 2ml per of water followed by cartap hydrochloride @ 1ml per lit of water after 12 days or Flubendiamide 20 % WG @ 48 g/acre or 6 g/kanal or 15 litre of water is recommended.   Regularly rogue out virus/mycoplasma infected brinjal, chillies, tomato, potato, etc. plants.
