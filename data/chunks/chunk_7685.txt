Pumpkin: Kashi Shishir (VRPKH-1) F1 Hybrid bears round and mottled green, 3–4 fruits/plant (2–2.25 kg) with higher yield potential (38–42 t/ha) during kharif but can be grown in zaid as well. Radish: Kashi Mooli-40 (VRRAD-203) is tolerant to high temperature (35–42°C) and suitable for summer cultivation, with 30–35 t/ha yield potential during rabi and 20–23 t/ha during zaid. Kashi Lohit (VRRAD-131- 2) has attractive red roots with 40–45 t/ha yield potential. CROP IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 56 Carrot: Kashi Krishna (VRCAR-126) has attractive black roots along with self-colour core with fewer secondary roots/scars. It is tolerant to bolting with 20– 22 t/ha yield potential. Cauliflower: Kashi Gobhi-25 (VRCF-50) is a tropical variety and matures during November (at 25°C). It has 25–28 t/ha estimated yield. Okra: Kashi Chaman (VRO-109) is resistant to yellow vein mosaic virus (YVMV) and okra enation leaf curl virus (OELCV) under field conditions.
