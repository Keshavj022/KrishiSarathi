 Indian farmers should raise area under two crops to 53 per cent from the present 40 per cent recorded in recent years. Area under high value crops is required to follow an increase of 4.4 per cent each year. Market reforms are required to enable farmers to get 17 per cent higher prices than base level in real terms. This requires 2.26 per cent increase in prices received by farmers in real terms. Finally, total number of cultivators is required to come down by 2.4 per cent each year. Suggested strategy to achieve the goal i. Promoting Integrated Farming System (IFS) ii. Strengthening Crop Diversification iii. Promoting in-situ Water Conservation in Rainfed iv. Promoting Organic Farming v. Popularizing Concept of IPM vi. Expanding Coverage Under Micro-irrigation vii. Broad basing Agricultural Extension viii. Empowering through Grass root Level Organizations ix. Creating Post Harvest Handling Facilities x. Adding Value through Agro-processing xi. Sensitizing towards quality Agro-produce xii. Encouraging Public-Private Partnership xiii. Making Agricultural Research More Relevant xiv. Making Agricultural Education More Useful xv. Revitalizing Agricultural - Extension Education 343 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 xvi. Increasing Use of IT through Cyber-Extension xvii. Access to market intelligence xviii. Bringing in Institutional Reforms particularly those with credit, insurance and marketing. Overall Strategy i. By increasing productivity of crops ii. Timely supply of good quality of sufficient seeds prior to season. iii. Timely availability of good quality of inputs iv. Applying short duration high yielding varieties. v. Increase SRR of hybrid seeds vi. By promoting Farm Mechanization vii. Application Integrated Nutrient Management viii. Application Integrated Pest Management ix. By increasing irrigation facilities x. Adoption of DSR/Zero Tillage/SRI xi. By increasing cropping intensity xii. According to land situation, irrigation and other facilities farm plan should be prepared for Kharif, Rabi and Garma for 03 years e.g.   Paddy - wheat/pulses/Maize   Maize – Wheat/Pulses/Maize   Maize – Wheat/Pulses/Maize - Mung   Vegetable (cauliflower) - potato - onion – mung   Maize/Vegetable – Potato-Potato-Onion-Mung   Paddy (short duration) - vegetable - onion - maize   Paddy - vegetable - maize xiii. Short duration hybrid/HYV seeds to be used. xiv. Use of rice fallow land xv. Rice- Makhana cropping System xvi. Diversification of cropping system with high value crops xvii. Cash crops- Sugarcane, cotton, soybean and Vegetables xviii. Spices - Turmeric, Ginger, Dhania, Garlic, and Ajwain xix. Mushroom Cultivation xx. Rearing of honey bee xxi. By Reducing cost of production 344 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 xxii. Subsidy on farm inputs xxiii. Provision of subsidy on HYV/ hybrid in light of market price. xxiv. Subsidy on mechanization in light of market price. xxv.
