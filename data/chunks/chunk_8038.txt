Bengal gram farmers reported similar results, but the changes in marketing pattern on the basis of price forecast were observed only in less perishable commodities. The income of farmers was increased by storing the produce for a few months in case of potato, mustard and bengal gram. The storage cost was covered by increase in prices. In Gujarat, the cotton farmers benefitted from the price forecast information. The average price realized by the Gujarat cotton farmers was ` 4,594, which increased later on to ` 5,040 as per the price forecast provided to farmers by JAU (Junagadh) centre. The farmers followed the price advisory and the incremental gain realized per farmer was ` 36,000. The regional studies helped in understanding the price movements, linkages between marketing infrastructure and price behaviour, impact on farmers’ decision making etc. Market intelligence efforts are extremely important and need to be institutionalized over time. There is a need to develop a sound market intelligence system in the country with wide coverage in terms of regionally important commodities. Timely, adequately and reliable forecast disseminated to farmers will be more effective if supported by market infrastructure and other logistics. Farm-size efficiency relationship in Punjab agriculture: The study analyzes the resource use efficiency and identifies the determinants of technical efficiency of paddy, wheat and cotton crops in Punjab. Large farmers were technically more efficient than the farmers with smaller land holdings in all selected crops. This implies the presence of economy of scale in the Punjab state. Large farmers made relatively higher use of machines and fertilizers per hectare and used less labour. On the other hand, marginal and small farmers applied more irrigation hours per hectare as compared to medium and large farmers leading to inefficient and injudicious use of groundwater resources.
