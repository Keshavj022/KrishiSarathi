 The age at first egg and age at 50% production were recorded at 115 and 142 days, respectively, at Bhubneshwar centre. Result from Bangalore centre (30th test) revealed maximum egg production (HD) for the pullets maintained in cages (276.01 egg), with maximum egg weight of 58.37 g in deep litter. The feed consumption/dozen of eggs was 2.010 kg and the margin of profit was Rs 33.45 over feed cost. TURKEY At the CARI, Izatnagar, for rearing and management practices of turkey under tropical climate, small variety turkey chicks were reared at three floor density (0.75, 1.0 and 1.5 ft2/bird) from day-old to eight weeks reared of age. The poults reared at 1.0 ft2 consumed less feed and gave better FCE (51.5%) as compared to other two densities (47.7 and 44.7% for 0.75 and 1.5 ft2 respectively). QUAIL At the CARI, Izatnagar, the broiler quail chicks hatched during summer and winter were provided floor space of 100, 150 and 180 cm2/bird during brooding period (0- 3 weeks). Thereafter, they were reared in the rearing cages until fifth week of age. The birds kept at 180 cm2 floor space recorded significantly higher body weight in third week and feed consumption than that of 100 cm2 and 150 cm2 floor space both during summer and winter. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) during 0-3 weeks were significantly better in 100 cm2 than quail provided 150 cm2 and 180 cm2 floor space. There was no significant difference in mortality at 3 different floor spaces. The birds provided extra floor space during rearing period recorded significantly higher fifth week body weight and 3-5 weeks body weight gain and better FCR. Mortality pattern remained unaffected at 3 floor spaces both during summer and winter. The fifth week carcass parameters were not significantly different at different floor spaces. GUINEAFOWL At the CARI, Izatnagar, the guineafowls are being improved for high growth rate and general disease resistance. A replacement stock of 2,168 keets was hatched from the parents selected for high body weight. The 12-week body weight Lavender, Pearl and White varieties was 843.73, 885.10 and 882.79 g, respectively. With the objective of developing the divergent lines for antibody response to sheep red blood cell (SRBC) the S-2 generation of high and low titre lines were generated and evaluated. The high and low titre lines showed significant differences for antibody titre against SRBC. ANIMAL HEALTH FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE The nucleotide sequence data of 500 different FMDV outbreak strains including the vaccine strains recovered from various parts of the country (consisting of serotypes O : 250 isolates, Asia 1 : 130 isolates and A : 120 isolates) during the last 25 years were sequenced. The nucleotide sequences thus obtained are compared with each other, the vaccine virus strain used in the country and the exotic strains of the respective serotypes. The evolutionary relationship of the sequences was calculated.
