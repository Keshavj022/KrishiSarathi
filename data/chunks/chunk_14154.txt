 On the positive side, the farmers affected by the negative impacts of chemical-based farming are willing to explore SAP alternatives, which provides the government and the NGOs the opportunity to carry out such interventions in regions where soil is progressively becoming saline and bar- ren due to high chemical usage. Therefore, relevant policies with appropriate funding and community-led ﬁeld interventions are necessary to promote awareness, knowledge-sharing, and peer-to-peer learning and to scale up the adoption of SAPs. Capacity building, in terms of extension workers, farm equipment, and labour, as well as restructuring existing subsidies that predominantly subsidise chemical inputs and water-intensive practices, is necessary in favour of sustainable practices. While the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and Par- amparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), which encourages the adoption of SAPs, are the right policies in this direction, they need to be scaled up substantially. As mentioned ear- lier, the amount of funds dedicated to these policies is minuscule compared to subsidies provided for chemical- based fertilisers. There is also a need to provide short-term support that covers the adverse effects of transition to encourage farmers to switch to SAPs. In the long run, it is essential to create visibility for SAPs through appropriate data collection and promotion at the state and national agri- cultural forums. 33 https://timesoﬁndia.indiatimes.com/india/over-39-soil-in-pun jab-completely-degraded/articleshow/18358798.cms  Accessed on 25 July 2023. 34 According to MoA annual report, only 3.2 million hectares of the 139.4 million hectares net sown area follows organic farming (Annual Report 2020-21, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare). 35 https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1895533 – Accessed on 12 August 2023. 28 H.
