2 Project funded under different calls: NASF awarded 282 multidisciplinary and multi-institutional projects in all strategic areas under different calls (Figure 2). The projects were awarded to public and private organizations associated with basic and strategic research in the field of agricultural science. The funded organizations include ICAR institutes, State agricultural universities, Central agricultural universities, general universities, IITs, AIIMS, NGOs, CSIR, DST and CGIR institutes and private universities. The projects consist of all the commodities viz. crop, horticulture, natural resources management, biotechnology, plant protection, animal, fisheries, social sciences etc. (Figure 3). Since the initiation of the scheme in 2006, ten calls for projects have been made which are mentioned as Call I (2006), Call II (2010), Call III (2011), Call IV (2012), Call V (2013), Call VI (2015), Call VII (2017), Call VIII (2018), Call IX (2019) and Call X (2023). A total of 282 projects have been awarded with a total budget of Rs.688.01 Cr. Currently, the projects in Call X have been awarded except five projects under the theme of social science & policy in agriculture. 7 Year-wise on-going projects The details of the year wise ongoing projects are shown in Fig.4. During the last 10 years, on an average, more than 65 projects are running on y-o-y basis.

The pluralistic nature of NASF has been exhibited by association of a wide array of institutions/agencies from the public sector, private sector and civil society organizations. Their level of participation varied across the various themes in accordance with the priority thrust areas identified under each one of them. The scheme involved about 60% of project implementing institutions in ICAR, 14% in SAUs and 1% in CAUs apart from other organizations. The spread of the projects in various organizations is depicted in Fig.5. The state-wise distribution of the projects showed that Delhi (20%), Uttar Pradesh (14.7%) and Haryana (9.
