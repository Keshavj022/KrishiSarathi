 Drought risk assessment and impacts analysis The agricultural community is a major vulnerable community in the GRB. Because of the uneven rainfall distribution, it is difficult for farmers to understand the drought situation and the associated impact. Therefore, to identify the level of risk and response capacity, we ana­ lysed the comprehensive drought risk assessment using various geo­ spatial data. The results of the drought risk assessment were helpful in the identification of areas at higher drought risk and more vulnerable to the potential climate change impacts, which was used to further eval­ uate socio-economic impacts under the worst-case drought scenarios. The assessment was based on the conceptual approach proposed by the United Nations Development Program (Prabnakorn et al., 2019) and applied by Sun et al. (2020). It consists of assessing the hazard, exposure, Fig. 8. Intra-annual variability of SPEI over a baseline (1981–2019) reference period at GRB. Fig. 9.

The results of the 12-month SPEI were further analysed to illustrate the level of drought hazard risk and to identify the worst-case drought scenario across each sub-basin over the GRB. Based on the drought indices (SPEI-12) during the base­ line period (1981–2019), we identified drought years (severe-to- extreme) and normal years. The year 2012 and 2009 faced a higher frequency of total drought events, at 57 and 56, respectively. Many re­ searchers suggested that the vegetation condition can be used as an in­ dicator for the identification of the drought condition of an area, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been widely used to identify the drought-related stress to the vegetation (Artikanur et al., 2022; Gumma et al., 2019; Nejadrekabi et al., 2022). Therefore, this study used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the main vegetation indicator to evaluate drought conditions during the severe drought years at GRB. The NDVI values were derived using MODIS-16-day composites (from, https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/), and the maps were illustrated for these two severe droughts years (Fig. 14). The range of the NDVI values indicates the drought severity, and based on the drought index scale, the areas affected by drought indicated by low NDVI values. Whereas the high NDVI values represent less drought- related stress to the vegetation, and hence represent the low-drought severity and risk over such areas.
