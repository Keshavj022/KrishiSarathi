 Mokarram and Aminzadeh (2010) suggest that Geographic Information System (GIS) is a more adaptable system for acquiring, investigating, and evaluating data and outcomes. Researchers can fix small mistakes more quickly and get more accurate results by working together (Saaty, 1980; Duc, 2006). There has been a significant amount of research on site suitability studies utilising MCDM and ML techniques, including Site Suitability Assessment for Rice Cultivation (Nyeko, 2012; Kihoro et al., 2013), Site suitability for agriculture (Zaredar and Jafari, 2010), for land manage­ ment purposes (Rojas and Loubier, 2017) for land-use suitability (Joerin et al., 2001; Romeijn et al., 2016) for Land suitability analysis for various crops (Jamil et al., 2018), for avulsion potential Zone con­ struction (Pal and Sarkar, 2018), for the recognition of touristic poten­ tial Zones (Ebrahimi et al., 2019), site suitability for conservation of water (Srdjevic and Medeiros, 2007) and water management (Badhe et al., 2019), Predicting the Soil Suitability (Jayaraman et al., 2021); Prediction of Cardiac Disease (Princy et al., 2020); Mapping the risk terrain for crime (Wheeler and Steenbeek, 2021) and executing surface and pressurized irrigation system (Azad et al., 2019), etc. In this study, the FCOPRAS (Fuzzy Complex Proportional Assess­ ment), AHP, and machine learning approaches, namely Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron have been used to discover the potentiality of the soil for agriculture, and ROC and Accuracy techniques have been also applied to estimate the proficiency of the applied models and al­ gorithms. Before arriving at the outcome, the weight of the alternatives for each variable was calculated (Malczewski and Boroushaki, 2008; Murayam and Bunruamkaew, 2011) using AHP. The opinions of three experts were considered in the whole process of the FCOPRAS. To aggregate the performing variables, the WLCM (Weighted Linear Com­ bination Method) was used. The land suitability assessment approach is a method for analysing land’s potential to determine the best location for growing various crops. In planning and managing land resources, one of the most ad­ vantageous uses of the Geographic Information System (GIS) is the study of site suitability and preparation of land use maps. GIS and Multi- Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) can be used well enough for plan­ ning and managing how agricultural land is used (Adeniyi, 1993; Shearer and Xiang, 2009). GIS makes it easy to store, process, and analyse complex raw data at plenty of different levels. Combining MCDM and Machine Learning (ML) with Geographic Information Sys­ tems (GIS) is an excellent technique (S´anchez-Lozano et al., 2013) to make good judgments in complex and dynamic agricultural systems. Agriculture is the economic backbone of West Bengal, employing about 60–70 per cent of the workforce and generating nearly 19.9 per cent of the state’s GDP in 2020–21.
