 • At Dharwad, significantly low severity of rust was noticed in seed treatment with P. jluorescens@ 10 g/kg seed. However, at Jalgaon, need based foliar application of NSKE @ 5% and seed treatment with mancozeb @ 3 g/kg seed significantly reduced the incidence of collar rot and stem rot followed by seed treatment with P. fluorescence @ 10 g/kg seed + soil application of P. fluorescence @ 2.5 kg/ha at 30 and 45 DAS. This treatment also gave highest pod yield of 1780 kg/ha. • At Latur, seed treatment with T harzianum @2 g/kg seed + seed treatment with Pseudomonas spp. @2 g/kg seed significantly reduced the incidence of stem rot and gave highest pod yield of 1092 kg/ha. • Based on three years data (2001, 2002 and 20(3) at Vriddhachalam and Jagtial it was revealed that integration of 2 foliar sprays of NSKE @ 5 % J()llowed by Quinalphos Ci!:} 0.05% and groundnut intercropped with castor (l 0: 1) was found most effective against Spodoptera lilura and realizing higher pod yield with CBR ofl:1.76. • At Vriddhachalam, integration of foliar application of NOn1uraea rileyi (@ 2 g/ lit and the foliar spray of 5% NSKE was found most economical (CBR 1: 1.45 1:1.79) for the management of 51', litura dming 2003‐04 and 2004‐05. • Three years data at Kadiri showed that integration of components viz., groundnut + bajra intercropping (8: 1) + one spray of Dimethoate 0.03% at 30 DAS significantly reduced the damage caused by thlips and realized higher pod yield (1825 kg/ha) and haulm yield ( 2408 kg/ha) and CBR of 1: 2.47. • Evaluation of IPM Module on Farmers' Field Under Micro‐Mission‐I of TMOP was allotted to 5 main centres of AICRPG (Dharwad, Jalgaon, Junagadh (JAU),Kadiri and Vriddhachalam) for 3 years (2003‐2005) to assess and refine IPM technology along with farmers' practice on farmers' fields. www.icar.org.in 43 2002 ‐ 2007 • Based on the information generated at 5 locations, it is suggested that the IPM technology with the main components of (i) soil application of Castor Cake @ 500 kg/ha (ii) seed treatment with Trichoderma sp (locally available formulation) (iii) 'intercropping with locally recommended intercrops (iv) need based application of crude neem oil (2%) and/or 5% NSKE, (v) erecting of pheromone traps @ 10/ha and (vi) if necessary, one spray of locally recommended chemical,may be adopted in groundnut based cropping system in the country. IV. New initiatives and future thrusts • Developing cultivars with tolerance/resistance/adapted to moisture deficit stress (early season / mid season and late season)/ major insects/diseases/cold and high temperature /acid soil!Al‐ toxicity/aflat.oxin • Development of early Virginia cultivars and Spanish cultivars with fresh seed dormancy and cultivars with better confectionery traits.
