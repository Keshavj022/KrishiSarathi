 2) 500/- Frame length: 53 cm Height of the frame at the blade point: 38 cm Effective blade length: 29 cm Total weight of the implement: 25 kg Filed trials were conducted in Meerkhanpet village with the following treatments using five replications in farmers’ fields : T 1, Interculture with pingali dhanti; T 2, Interculture with traditional blade harrow; T 3, T 1 + hand weeding twice; and T 4, T2 + hand weeding twice. Tomato (Kanchana) was used as the test crop during kharif 2002. Where, Wn, weeding efficiency; Wc, total weed count before weeding per unit area; and Wt, total weed count after weeding per unit area. Draft of implement: The horizontal component of pull requirement to pull each implement was measured using spring-type dynamometer (kg). Energy expenditure: To obtain better comparative results, the energy required to carry out interculture and weeding operations under each treatment were converted into energy units using standard conversion factors, and total energy expenditure per hectare was calculated. Thr specifications of the implements used for validation of ITK are as follows: Pingali dhanti (Fig. 1.) 500/- Frame width: 25 cm Fig. 2. Traditional blade harrow Fig. 1. Pingali dhanti Table 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The experimental site in Meerkhanpet village on an average received 394 mm rainfall as against a normal rainfall of 552 mm received during May to October 2002. The crop in different farmer’s fields experienced a dry spell of 30 days during vegetative phase and 13 days at the time of flowering during life-cycle of the crop. However, Table 2.
