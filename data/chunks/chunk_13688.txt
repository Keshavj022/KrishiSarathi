 For the determination of total SOC in this study, an automatic elemental analyser (vario EL, Elementar Analyser system GmbH, Hanau, Germany) was used. The SOC stocks are calculated through the following formula: Total SOC stock of a soil depth (Mg ha–1) = Total SOC concentration (g kg−1) × BD (Mg m–3) × depth (m) × 10 Table 1 Physical and chemical properties of soils under different land uses.

Soil & Tillage Research 223 (2022) 105443 3 The above computation of SOC is often inadequate for comparison of two scenarios, where management practices induced significant changes in bulk density (BD), changing in turn the mass of soil present in the concerned layer. For example, the NG had 0.212, 0.218 and 0.233 Mg m−2 soil masses in 0–15, 15–30 and 30–45 cm soil depths, respectively. On the other hand, the AH systems had 0.225, 0.234 and 0.237 Mg m−2 soil masses in respective soil depths. To correct for the overestimation of C stock in the soil with greater BD relative to the soil with lesser BD, we, therefore, designated the mass of NG as the equivalent soil mass (ESM), and calculated soil C stocks on ESM basis using following equations (Ellert and Bettany, 1995): Total SOC stock on ESM basis (Mg ha−1) = Total SOC on soil depth basis – Error term. Where, Error term = Total SOC concentration (g kg−1) × (Msoil– ESM) × 10 Where, Msoil is the soil mass and ESM is the equivalent soil mass. Both these terms are expressed in Mg m−2. The calculations are as follows: ESM (Mg m−2) = BD of NG system (Mg m–3) × depth (m) Msoil (Mg m−2) = BD (Mg m–3) × depth (m) The permanganate–oxidisable organic carbon or KMnO4-C (POC) was determined by the process given by Tirol-Padre and Ladha (2004). Detailed method is given in Supporting Information (SI: Methods 2). The data obtained from the experiments were subjected to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) appropriate to the experimental design (one way ANOVA) as given by Gomez and Gomez (1984).
