Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/ species): Bio NPK Liquid Biofertilizer is a unique kind of bioformulation comprising nitrogen (N2) fixing (Azotobacter chroococum), P-solubilizing (Paenibacillus tylopili) and K-solubilizing (Bacillus decolorationis) bacteria. It has a longer shelf life (12–24 months) without loss of microbial populations and properties upon exposure to high temperature. 2. Target crops and delivery system: Bio NPK can be used for cereals, millets, pulses, vegetables and oil producing commercial crops. Inoculation can be done through seed treatment, root dip for seedlings and soil application for tree plants. 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): All 4. Validation and commercialization: The technology has been validated for Maize at multiple locations under AICRP, for fodder crops at ICAR-IGFRI, Jhansi; for groundnut at multiple locations under AICRP (groundnut); for Wheat at ICAR- IARI and ICAR-NBAIM, Mau and under farmers’ fields for rice and wheat. In addition, the technology has given good results in citrus orchards (in Punjab), papaya (Begusarai, Bihar), ginger and turmeric (Anand, Gujarat). 5. Whether licensed to private companies, If yes, details thereof: A patent application (CBR Number: 23706; patent numbered 3364/DEL/2015; dt 19.10.2015) has been filed for ‘A Microbial Consortium’. The technology has been licensed to:   M/s Monal Potteries and Ceramics Pvt Ltd., Himachal Pradesh   Prathista Industries Ltd., Secundrabad 6. Benefits: Bio NPK has shown remarkable response in the farmers’ fields with respect to crop growth and yield. It could save the usage of chemical fertilizers from 25 to 50% of the recommended dose without compromising yield and growth of the plants. Application of Bio NPK biofertilizer with 50% recommended dose of fertilizer resulted in at par yield in wheat and 22% increase in maize as compared to recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF). It has shown a saving of chemical fertilizers up to 25-30 kg of Nitrogen, 10-15 kg of Phosphorus and 2–5 kg Potassium with increase in grain yield in crops like rice, wheat and maize. Its application can result in a net saving of Rs. 2500 per hectare. 7.
