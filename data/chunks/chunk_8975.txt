 The quality VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS FROM S O R G H U M The processes for preparation of sev and papad from sorghum were developed and evaluated in laboratory. The processes were standardized. Soyflour (10%) was added in the sorghum flour for nutritional enrichment of sev. For quality product with nutritional enrichment, Bengalgram flour in the proportion of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50% was added in sorghum flour with 10% soyflour for preparation of sev. From the sensory evaluation it was revealed that the product prepared from addition of Bengalgram flour @ 40% and 50% in sorghum flour with 10% soyflour are on par with each other and significantly superior over products prepared with sorghum flour + 10% soyflour, sorghum flour + 10% soyflour with 10, 20, 30% Bengal gram flour. In papad, the soybean flour was mixed with sorghum flour in the proportion of 0,5,10,15 and 20% for nutritional enrichment. It was revealed from sensory evaluation that the product prepared with 10% soyflour is significantly superior over products prepared with 0, 5, 15 and 20% soyflour. The study revealed that mixing of Bengalgram flour 40% in sorghum flour and 10% soyflour is better for preparation of sev and addition of soyflour up to 10% with sorghum flour is acceptable for preparation of papad. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 142 of shrikhand was in accordance with the recommended levels of the different constituents as per BIS standard. Sensory evaluation revealed that shrikhand prepared with soy milk supplementation up to 50% (v/v) was acceptable. Preparation of Soy-fortified Doughnuts Doughnuts were prepared using full fat soy flour with 10, 20 and 30% blends in the basic formula. On the basis of the dough consistency data, it was concluded that as the level of soy substitution increased, amount of water due to increased water absorption by the flour required for developing the desired dough, sheetable consistency increased. The doughnuts prepared by 20% soy substitution fried at 170°C indicated increase in frying time, lipid content and oil uptake (24.7%). However, the lipid content and oil uptake by these soy-fortified doughnuts were always lower than the control (33 and 31%, respectively). Hence, 20% soy substitution level was judged the best. The lipid content and oil uptake for 30% soy substitution were 39 and 32%, respectively. It was observed that the moisture loss of the sample with 20% soy substitution was minimum. This finding is further corroborated by another result, i.e. final moisture content, which again is highest in case of the same sample. On the basis of oil uptake and acceptability score it was observed that doughnuts with 20% of soyflour substitution were much better than the control sample. PLASTICS IN AGRICULTURE A demand feeder using transparent acrylic plastics material was designed at CIFA, Bhubaneshwar for pond culture systems to feed the fishes.
