Ex situ Conservation of AnGR Germplasm repository at National Gene Bank is being strengthened by preserving diversified form of animal germplasm (semen, somatic cells and DNA) of indigenous livestock and poultry. A total of 44,860 semen doses of 17 native livestock breeds, including nine of cattle (Red Sindhi, Badri, Red Kandhari, Nimari, Deoni, Gaolao, Bhijarpuri, Ghumsari, Khariar) and 8 of goat breeds (Ganjam, Jamnapari, Beetal, Berari, Osmanabadi, Sirohi, Sangamneri and Barbari) were cryopreserved in the National Gene Bank. Also, 1,020 somatic cell vials of 7 native breeds- Purnea, Mewati, Hariana and Shweta Kapila of cattle, Konkan Kanyal of goat, Doom and Purnea of pig were added for cryopreservation. Presently, National Gene Bank has repository of 61 native breeds/populations of livestock and poultry in form of Semen, and 28 in form of Somatic cells. Pig An improved crossbred pig variety ‘Rani’, developed by using Hampshire (male) and Ghoongroo (female) pigs, has completed the eighth generation of inter-se mating. The generation- wise genetic performance has revealed stability in the performance of the developed variety over the generations. The litter size at birth and weaning were recorded as 9.91±0.40 and 8.92±0.32, respectively for the 9th generation. Large scale propagation of the developed variety coupled with use of scientific package of practices and artificial insemination has ensured its rapid propagation as well as sustainable livelihood among the farmers.
