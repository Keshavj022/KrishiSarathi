Murai and Parvender Sheoran CSK Himachal Pradesh Krishi Vishvavidyalaya, Palampur, Himachal Pradesh 176 062 Backyard poultry farming plays a crucial role in enhancing livelihoods and nutritional security in rural areas of India. Despite India's significant growth in commercial poultry, rural households still face challenges in accessing quality animal protein. Backyard poultry production offers a viable, low-cost means for providing nutritious food, especially eggs and chicken meat, which are affordable and accessible protein sources. This farming system, predominantly managed by rural women, contributes to food security, poverty alleviation, and empowerment. In Himachal Pradesh, backyard poultry has grown substantially, with the introduction of 'Himsamridhi', a local breed well-suited for hilly terrain and free-range systems. Research has shown that the 'Himsamridhi' breed performs well under rural conditions, providing higher egg and meat yields, contributing to household income. The introduction of improved breeds, better management practices, and community support has made backyard poultry an economically feasible option for rural households, yielding positive outcomes in nutrition and income generation.

A shortage of animal protein is one of the major factors contributing to frequent health problems in rural areas. Ensuring the availability of nutritious food with adequate supplementation of animal proteins is essential to protect rural people from protein malnutrition and promote proper growth and good health. Chicken meat and eggs, which are highly nutritious sources of animal protein, are readily available in rural areas and can effectively supplement the animal protein requirement at an affordable price. Empirical and circumstantial evidence shows that poultry development interventions can bring significant benefits to households by contributing to food security, womenâ€™s empowerment, and poverty reduction. Over the years, backyard poultry farming has significantly contributed to the agrarian economies of various countries. Although rural poultry production has relatively low productivity, it remains a valuable asset to local populations. Backyard poultry farming is one of the proven and effective tools for alleviating protein hunger and providing supplemental income for rural and tribal populations across the country.
