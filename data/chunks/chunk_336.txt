 One of the earliest grain sorghum cultivars released at state level was M 35-1, developed in 1938 by Agricultural Research Station at Mohol, Solapur (currently under MPKV, Rahuri) by selection from local Maldandi population, which became very popular in post-rainy tracts of Deccan plateau. It was formally released for cultivation in 1969. This variety proved its merit by stable performance under rainfed (residual moisture) situations and producing bold lustrous grains. The fodder quality was also good and thus became cultivar of choice in rabi sorghum tracts across the country. Subsequently, a number of varieties adapted to both rainy as well as post-rainy seasons were developed and released for cultivation in major sorghum growing states. The details of high yielding and popular cultivars released for different states in recent years are compiled in Tables 2 to 8 for the benefit of sorghum farmers of different growing regions. Apart from grain sorghum, some of the varieties were also released in special purpose sorghums like hurda, popping, flaking, etc., which are popular in certain regional pockets in Maharashtra and Karnataka.
