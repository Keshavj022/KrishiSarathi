 To circumvent emergence of antigenically divergent VP359-deletion group strains in serotype A, an alternate vaccine candidate strain (A IND 27/2011) was identified for replacement of the existing vaccine strain A IND 40/2000 to maintain the vaccine efficacy and is ready for inclusion in vaccine formulation. Exotic and emerging diseases Genetic diversity in H5N1 avian influenza viruses: Complete genome sequence of six H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (Bihar-4 and Odisha- 2) isolated from chickens, ducks, crows and peacocks in different epicenters, was determined. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene revealed that the viruses grouped separately (>5% divergence between the viruses isolated in Odisha and Bihar) within the HA clade 2.3.2.1a of H5N1 viruses. The phylogeny indicated that the outbreaks of H5N1 viruses in Bihar and Odisha epidemiologically distinct, were caused by independent introduction events. The persistence and cross border movement of the H5N1 viruses circulating in South Asia indicated that there is a need for continuous active surveillance. Molecular characterization of H5N8 avian influenza viruses: Molecular characterization of 20 H5N8 viruses revealed presence of multibasic cleavage site in HA gene indicating high pathogenicity to poultry, which correlated with the pathogenic characterization (IVPI of 2.96â€“3.00/3.00). The PB1-F2 protein was truncated because of nucleotide mutation C35A. Except the polymerase acidic (PA) and NP genes, all other gene segments of H5N8 viruses shared high nucleotide identity ranging from 99.2 to 99.5%. The nucleotide identity of the PA and NP gene was 95.8 and 94.8%, respectively, suggesting involvement of 2 gene pools of H5N8 virus in the outbreaks. In HA gene phylogeny, the Indian isolates clustered within group B (intercontinental group B) of clade 2.3.4.4 viruses. The phylogenetic analysis of various genes of isolated H5N8 viruses suggested that they are 7:1 reassortant of the Tyva and Uvs-Nuur lake H5N8 viruses. The MJ network analysis indicated that the contemporary H5N8 viruses isolated from wild birds in UvsNuur Lake (located at Mongolia-Russia border), Qinghai Lake (China) and Tyva Republic are not the direct ancestors and closely related precursor gene pools are the source of the H5N8 viruses that caused the outbreaks in India. Genetic characterization of Indian PRRS viruses: Two porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses (Ind-30141086/MZ-KLK2/2018 and Ind- 30141076/MZ-SL1/2018) isolated from the disease outbreak in Mizoram in 2018 were genetically characterized. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the nsp- 2 coding region showed that they belong to highly pathogenic variant of PRRSV genotype-2. Phylogenetic analysis of the ORF-5 and ORF-7 regions showed that the 2018 isolates grouped together with Chinese and Myanmar PRRSV isolated in 2010 and 2011. In the ORF- 7 region, the nucleotide sequence identity between the two Indian 2018-isolates was 99.
