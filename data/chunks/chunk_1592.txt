 Moreover, cultivating date palms in areas like Jaisalmer provides a stable income through high-value fruits. The National Horticulture Board (NHB) offers schemes for area expansion and post-harvest management, helping farmers enhance yields and access broader markets. The Aromatic Plants Program under the National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB) supports cultivation, ensuring technical guidance and market linkages for cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants like ashwagandha, aloe vera, chamomile, Shankhpushpi and Kalmegh. Seed production and nursery management Producing quality seeds of drought-resistant crops like pearl millet, mung bean, cluster bean and seed- spices ensures better crop yields and food security. The Seed Village Program supports local seed production, promoting self-reliance and reducing dependency on external sources. Production of certified seeds fetches premium prices, helping farmers increase their income. Besides, establishing nurseries for forestry trees, fruit plants and medicinal plants can be highly lucrative, supporting afforestation efforts and providing income during off-seasons. NABARD and the National Afforestation and Eco-Development Board (NAEB) offer grants for nursery development, supporting income diversification and environmental conservation. Agroforestry and carbon sequestration Integrating trees with crops and livestock improves soil health, reduces erosion, and provides additional income through timber and fruits. For example, planting Khejri (Prosopis cineraria) trees alongside pearl millet enhances soil fertility and provides fodder. Newer plants like Melia dubia are also performing good under arid conditions. The National Agroforestry Policy promotes such practices, offering incentives and technical guidance to farmers. Farmers can also Display of value-added products by farm women during G20 Summit at Delhi Indian Farming 95 January 2025 earn through carbon credits by adopting environment friendly practices like agroforestry. Programs like the Green India Mission support these activities, providing technical and financial assistance for climate-resilient agriculture. Organic and niche markets Organic farming is profitable for crops like organic spices (cumin, fennel and ajwain), which have strong export potential. The Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) supports organic certification, reducing costs for farmers and helping them reach high-value markets. Moreover, growing specialty crops like quinoa, chia, and moringa helps farmers diversify their income streams and meet the needs of health-conscious consumers. FPOs play a key role in collective branding and marketing, improving access to urban and export markets. Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) supports rural entrepreneurs with marketing and technical assistance, helping them expanding their products (like eco-friendly products such as neem-based herbal soaps) to the consumers.
