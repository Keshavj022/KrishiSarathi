)   The dry fodder like paddy straw and sorghum stover may be enriched with urea or molasses and salt to enhance the digestibility in large ruminants   Hydroponics fodder may be utilized wherever available @ 10-12 kg /adult cow /day   During the onset of rainfall worm infestation may be more. Hence proper deworming has to be done at regular intervals by assessing the worm load in dung at any clinical laboratories or outreach centers of the University.   Management of ectoparasites may be taken up by use of medicinal dip or topical applications or by injections.   For calves up to 3-6 months of age, mineralised salt blocks may be hanged in the sheds to prevent mineral deficiency.   Supplementation of TANUVAS mineral mixture along with concentrate feed @ 30- 50 gm/ animal /day for milch animals   Supplementation of TANUVAS mineral mixture along with concentrate feed @ 15 gm/animal /day for dry animals   Supplementation of Salt (NaCl) @ 30-50 g/day/animal for better milk yield   Supplementation of Sodium Bi-carbonate (Baking soda) @ 30-50 g/day/animal for better milk fat yield and Sodium bicarbonate helps stabilize rumen pH by reducing acidic conditions and to avoid sub- acute ruminal acidosis (SARA).   Azolla supplementation may be taken-up @1-2 Kg/dairy cattle per day   If brewer’s yeast or any other unconventional feed is added in the ration, farmers are advised to feed not more than 10% in the ration   TANUVAS Masti-guard may be used to prevent Mastitis and for clean milk production.   Farmers to utilize the validated EVM (Ethno Veterinary Medicine) practices for management of disease. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 171   Vaccinate the animals against FMD   Do not feed concentrate during day time provide only early morning late evening   Do not allow animals for grazing at a time between 9am to 5pm (particularly during heat wave period.   Provide one lemon +100 jaggery+50g salt in drinking water to all the animals during hot weather sun light. Don’t not keep the water trough directly under sun light, keep it under shade   Sprinkle the water all over the surface of animal’s body and don’t put wet gunny bag over the animal’s body.   If any clinical signs like severe salivation, off feed, restless, diarrhoea, loss of milk yield, consult veterinary scientist   Should not feed stunted sorghum (before flouring stage) to animals leads to HCN poisoning finally results in collapse of animal. Small Ruminants (Sheep and goat)   Keep animals in well ventilated shelters/tree shades   Locally available feed materials may be effectively used for feeding and the same popularized   Hydroponics fodder may be utilized wherever available.   Before the onset of monsoon, based on worm load by dung examination, deworming to be done with appropriate deworming medicine.
