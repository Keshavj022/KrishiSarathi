 Methodology adopted A field study was carried out at selected farmer fields at Barauli, Santa and Hadbansi adopted villages under the FFP project in Morena district for 3 years (2018–19 to 2020–21). An innovative relay cropping of berseem was established in standing mustard crop grown in rotation with pearl millet/paddy and greengram cropping systems. As per treatments, pearl millet (var.-NHB 4903), paddy (var.-Pusa 1509) and greengram (var.-Shikha) were raised during rainy (kharif) season followed by succeeding crop of mustard (var.- Giriraj) raised in winter (rabi) season. After the establishment of 30–35 days of mustard, berseem (var.- Wardan) seeds were sown by uniform broadcasting @20 kg/ha just before first irrigation of mustard. The seed treatment of berseem was done with captan (2 g/kg seed) followed by Rhizobium trifoli and Pseudomonas fluorescens. The recommended agronomical packages practices were followed. As per FFP project’s general standards, demonstration plots size was 4,000 m2. The relay crop of berseem was grown in residual soil fertility of mustard. After harvest of mustard (March), 3 irrigations at tillering, head formation and seed filling stages of berseem were given. Pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera) is a serious polyphagous sporadic pest in berseem seed production, which damages the berseem head by common pod borer. This pest was controlled by using spinosad @150 ml/ha at the economic threshold level. The berseem crop was harvested during 3 to 4th week of May. The seed and straw yields of Indian Farming 8 August 2023 individual crops were recorded. Technology adoption measurement rainy season crops: The grain yield of rainy season crops (pearl millet, paddy and greengram) increased from 9.4–10.8% and stover yield from 7.3–12.2% with relay berseem as compared with without relay cropping (Table 1). The relay cropping berseem improved grain yield of paddy with maximum (10.8%), followed by pearl millet (10.1%) and least with greengram (9.4%). Among rainy season crops, higher production cost of paddy varied from `33,200–34,100/ha followed by pearl millet (`23,600– 24,100/ha) and least with greengram (`21,400–22,900/ha). The higher yield of rainy season crops grown in relay cropping fields increased additional returns from `3,300– 6,600/ha as compared without relay cropping. The trend of NRs was maximum (`54,400/ha) with paddy followed by pearl millet (`47,400/ ha) and lowest with greengram crop (`33,600/ha) in relay cropping system. Relaying legume berseem residues improves soil properties resulting in greater productivity of crops, system and net profit. The B:C ratio was higher with relay cropping (2.6–3.1) as compared to without relay cropping (2.3–2.8). Winter season crop (mustard): Results of relay cropping technology led to an improvement in seed yield of winter crop mustard from 8.5– 11.3% and straw yield from 6.6–8.8% as compared without relay cropping (Table 1).
