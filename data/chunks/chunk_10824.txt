 Millets   Millets are often grown as catch crops where other crops have failed due to unfavorable weather.   Most millets such as Jowar, Ragi, Bajra, Sorghum, etc. are grown as Kharif crops i.e. as monsoon or autumn crops cultivated between June to November,   Ploughing should be done at the onset of monsoon.   Seed are very small hence fine tilth is imperative for proper germination and crop establishment, minimize weeds problem and effective soil moisture conservation. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 94   A mean temperature range of 26-29°c during the growth is best for proper development.   Millets produce well on well-drained loamy soils with good drainage.   Varieties like VL Madua 376.VL Madua 379.VL Madua 380 can be successfully grown.   Maintain Spacing of 20-25cm row-to-row, 8-10cm plant- to- plant.   Seed Rate of 6-8 kg/ha for line sowing at 3-4 cm deep.   For transplanted crop Seed should be sown in well prepared nursery beds during the month of May-July about 4 Kg of seed will give enough seedlings to transplant 1 ha of land. 3 to 4 week old seedlings should be transplanted two seedlings per hill at a distance of 25 cm x 8 cm or transplanted 2-3 cm deep   The seed should be treated with Thiram, Carbendazim or Mancozeb @ 2-3 g/Kg of seed.   Apply FYM-5 to 10 tonnes/ha. FYM should be applied one month before sowing. N-60 Kg/ha, P2O5 30 Kg/ha, K2O-30 Kg/ha   It is grown mixed with Soybean.   The inter-cultivation and weeding should be done with hand hoe, three hoeing would be sufficient to control the weeds in problem areas.   Diseases: To control Blast (Pyriculariasetariae), Brown spot (Helmithosporiumsetariae), rust (Uromycessetariae) Spray Mancozeb (0.2%) and warrant a spray only if they appear at the early stages of crop growth.   Treat the seeds with Carbendazim @ 2g/kg for controlling Grain Smut (Ustilagocrameri)   For controlling Green ear (Sclerosporagraminicola) treat the seeds with Ridomil MZ @ 2g/kg. Rouging out the affected plants.   Pests To control pest like Army worm, cut worm and leaf scrapping beetle that appear occasionally in serious form , apply Thiomethoxam 5 gm/15 litres of water Pulses and oilseeds   Land preparation and sowing of mungbean var. IPM 02-3, should be completed by May in high altituide region with seed rate of 12-15 kg/ha at a spacing of 30cmx10cm and apply 44 kg/ha urea, 250kg SSP/ha and 33 kg/ha Potash at sowing time.   High yielding Black gram varieties like PU 31 and Green gram variety Pratap can be taken up in the farmers field wherever rice cultivation cannot be done.   Rice bean variety BRS-1 and RBL-6 can be grown successfully along with the Jhum rice and in maize intercropping system.   Land preparation and sowing of groundnut var, ICGS-76, Girnar-3 in high altitude region should be completed by May with seed rate of 60-80 kg/ha at a spacing of 45cmx15cm and apply 44 kg/ha urea, 250kg SSP/ha and 33 kg/ha Potash at sowing time.
