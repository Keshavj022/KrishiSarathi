7 kb; and structural composition comprised 37 genes including 13 protein coding, 22 tRNA and 2 ribosomal RNAs (12S rRNA and 16S rRNA). The availability of mitochondrial genomes will be useful resource for molecular systematics, biogeography as well as comparative genomics.

The gen- erated COI sequences were submitted to GenBank (KJ020210-KJ020214, KJ020215-KJ020217). Morphotypes in Indian oil sardine: Indian oil sardine, Sardinella longiceps shows divergent morphology while in sympatry and reasons for morphological divergence were investigated using morphometric, genetic and nutritional analysis. Based on visual appearance there are three variants. Variant 1 and 2 were collected from Kozhikode and termed as stout (normal) and slender sardines, respectively. Variant 1 had more fat content compared to variant 2, indicating differences in habitat/niche use and consequent differences in dietary preference. Variant 3, available only from Gulf of Oman was termed as Oman sardine. They were heavier with greater body depth indicating presence of greater energy reserves and a good condition factor. Morphotypes of Indian oil sardine are the result of divergent selection and adaptive variation to maximize fitness to a particular habitat and thus optimize habitat use. Whole mitogenome scans in Indian oil sardine from different locations also ascertained the above conclusions. Genome size of commercially important and endangered freshwater fish species: Genomic DNA content and ploidy level in blood cells of 52 economically important freshwater fishes were estimated. The average genome size ranged from 0.58±0.03 pg in banded gourami (Trichogaster fasciata) to 1.92±0.04 pg in scribbled goby (Awaous grammepomus). Among the Order DNA content ranged from 0.64±0.07 to 1.45±0.073 pg in Cypriniformes, 0.70±0.07 to 1.41±0.02 pg in Siluriformes and 0.60±0.05 to 1.92±0.04 pg in Perciformes. The nuclear DNA content exhibited variations within and between the Orders. Further, no relationship was observed between the genome size, chromosome number and organism complexity among the 52 species. New records of nuclear DNA content of 44 species were also generated. Phylogenetic analysis among penaeid shrimps: Mitochondrial DNA genes were explored to study the phylogenetic relationships among the penaeid shrimps. Phylogenetic relationships expose evolutionary paths and speciation events for a particular species. Full mitogenome of Penaeus indicus has the same 13 protein- coding genes like other penaeid shrimps. The 13 protein- coding nucleotide sequences of 10 penaeid shrimp mitogenomes (Metapenaeus ensis, M.
