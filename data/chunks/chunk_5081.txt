 The pulp was scooped out and placed in the bucket provided for the purpose. Then water was added and kept for fermentation. After 36 hours the seeds were checked at regular intervals for removal of sliminess. When the seeds were found fully free from mucilaginous material, they were separated, washed, dried and stored. Seed extraction by use of dilute hydrochloric acid The pulp of taomato was collected in a plastic bucket in the in the same way as mentioned above and dilute (10%) HCl was added at the rate of 10 ml/ from 10 kg fruits of BT-10 variety in each treatment. The crop was sown on 2 November 2002 and transplanted on 4 December 2002. Observations were taken on (i) seed colour, (ii) germination percentage, (iii) seed recovery, (iv) duration of seed extraction, and (v) seed yield. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study The PRA conducted in village Benakunda revealed that ITK method (lemon juice) was found to be superior to fermentation method is colour, seed germination (85%) and time consumption for seed extraction. Lemon juice Table 1. Matrix table for assessing performance of lemon juice method vis-Ã -vis fermentation method for tomato seed extraction Parameter Mean value Fermentation method Lemon juice method Seed quality Average Good Ease of operation Easy Easy Time consumption (hours) 48 Less than 24 Seed germination (%) 75 85 Plant growth Good Good Yield of fruits (q/ha) 200 200 kg of pulp. When the action of acid pulp was completed, the seeds were separated, washed thoroughly, dried and stored. The experiment was laid out in CRD design with 15 replications. The seeds were extracted method was found to be easy and was completed within 12 hours as compared to fermentation method, which takes more than 48 hours (Table1). Fruit yield and plant growth were found to be similar in both the methods. Table 2.

Seeds were dull brown and light brown in fermentation and dilute HCl method respectively. Time taken for extraction of seeds was least (4.28 hour) when HCl was used. Seed extraction by lemon juice took 8.30 hr, which was 46.86 hr by fermentation method. Recovery of seed was higher in lemon juice and fermentation method as compared to hydrochloric acid method. Germination percentage of the extracted seed was significantly higher when the seeds were extracted by using lemon juice. Seed yield was similar in fermentation and lemon juice methods (8.25 to 8.
