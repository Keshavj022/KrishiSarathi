 Animal Husbandry Research   The major challenges are   Ensuring breeds / technologies for sustained increase in yield and to meet the end users’ expectations in terms of quality and food safety.   Ensuring service provision and to enable farmers to take informed decisions based on prices of different animal products.   Harnessing research output of frontier sciences to increase value added animal products, storage and processing. I. Fishery Weakness   Reduced Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) in Fishing   Many water bodies received water only during north-east monsoon   Non-availability of adequate infrastructure facilities for seed production, rearing, fish landing and marketing   Fish culture in natural and small water systems is being practiced by stock and harvest method and not by scientific culture method   Lack of post-harvest facility like cold storage and fish processing unit at the shore.   Largely inadequate fish seed production   Low fish productivity of tanks   Non-availability of stock size quality fish seeds throughout the year   Lack of efficient fishing gears for operation in deep waters   Inadequate training packages on fish culture, breeding and seed rearing, feed formulation and fish diseases diagnosis etc.   Paucity of funds to fish seed rearing centres   Insufficient area for fish seed production   Lack of hygienic handling of fish in marketing   Low infrastructure support for artisanal fisherman impede the growth in fish production   Poor technology adoption in the mechanized crafts and low hygiene are the major bottle necks in promoting export oriented fishing and product development   Under-utilization of short seasonal tanks and 499 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022   Absence of dead storage level in the reservoirs affects the natural fish stock. Opportunities   Vast market and potential buyers   Escalating demand for seed, and table fish   Scope for ornamental fishes and demand for new varieties   Increased awareness about the profitability of Integrated farming with Fisheries component   Vast expansion of marine resources with diverse fishes in the off-shore area provides good opportunity for increasing marine fish catching   Large scale coastal aquaculture is possible   Mariculture, including pearl culture, spat production, lobster fattening and multiple newer fishing product preparations possible.   Rehabilitating the affected and unutilized shrimp farms for mari-culture activities.   Ample opportunities for developing coastal / back water shrimp farming on large scale with greater rigor.   Effective utilization of short seasonal tanks and ponds in the network of inland water ways for fish production   Establishment of large scale seed production and supply centres and   Availability of seeds of short duration aquaculture species viz. GIFT Tilapia, Pangassius sp. etc.
