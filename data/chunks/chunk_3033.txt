06 kg per 100 kg compost was obtained in the treatment of DDVP + Bavistin (@ 3ml+0.5 g/ 10 kg compost). Casing of button mushroom begs with Coir pith + FYM (1:1) as casing material recorded significantly higher mushroom yield of 14.56 g/100 kg compost The strain U‐3 responded well to Veradix‐2 (rooting hormone) spray and spray @ 0.15% gave highest button mushroom yield of 18.62g/100 kg compost The strain U‐3 interacted well with Phosphotika biofertilizer and mixing of Phosphotika biofertilizer @ 1.0% in compost at the time of spawning gave significant increase in yield of button mushroom yield (15.54 g/100kg compost) over control. Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus spp.) The supplementation treatment of Rice bran @ 4% of dry weight of substrate recorded significantly higher yield of 705 gm/kg of substrate of P. sajor caju and 742 gm/kg substrate of P.florida. Highest yield of 592g/Kg. dry straw of P. sajor caju and 552g/Kg dry straw of P. florida was recorded in control treatment i.e. water spray. Spray with 0.1M K2HPO4 performed well in P. sajor caju and gave superior mushroom yield. The blue oyster (Hysizygus ulmarius) yielded of 788 g/kg dry substrate and was statistically superior yielder over P. sajor caju (637 g/kg dry substrate) and P. florida (577g/kg dry substrate). Other Mushrooms: Out of 9 strains only 5 strains gave fruiting. Among the five fruiting strains, the strain CI‐1 recorded maximum yield of 257 g/kg dry straw. Next best strain was CI‐3 followed by CI‐4 and CI‐5. The highest fresh mushroom yield of Milky mushroom (Calocybe indica) was obtained in mixture of wheat + paddy straw (1:1) (i.e. 1361 g/kg dry substrate). Next best substrate treatment was paddy straw, showing 1344 g mushrooms/ kg dry substrate. The supplementation of sawdust with 20% wheat bran gave superior yield of shiitake mushroom (Lentinula edodes). Post Harvest Technology: The acceptable colour of white button mushroom was retained in treatment of 200 ppm and 75 ppm EDTA under ambient and refrigerated conditions, respectively. Both these treatment also recorded maximum reduction in weight of mushroom. At refrigerated condition treatment of 100 ppm EDTA and 100 ppm EDTA + 0.02 % KMS showed retention of good milky white colour of button up to 48 hrs. However, at ambient temperature desired colour was retained in 100 ppm EDTA +0.02% KMS treatment up to 24 hrs. Packaging of button mushroom in100 gauge PP bags with holes helped in maintaining good acceptable white colour up to 24 hrs. at ambient and refrigerated storage conditions. www.icar.org.in 60 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Horticulture Mushroom Germplasm Collection and Survey & Surveillance of Diseases and Insect Pests: A total of 106 samples of wild fleshy fungi were collected. Out of these 35 cultures were successfully isolated in pure form. A total of 6 cultures isolated from wild fleshy fungi have been deposited to NRCM, Chambaghat, Solan (HP).
