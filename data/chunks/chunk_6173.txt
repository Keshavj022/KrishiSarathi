05% Bavisitin 62.40 72.00 Control 60.00 70.80 treatment through Bavistin helped the setts sprout earlier. There was no incidence of disease in yam at both research centre and farmers' fields during both the years studied. Inoculation effect on sprouting Results obtained on the effect of inoculation on sprouting of yam are given in Table 4. About 97% of the treated tubers sprouted on 20th day after inoculation with SI04 micro-organism, which was 100% on 30th day. Unsterilized fresh cowdung helped in better sprouting (97% on 30 th day) over the sterilized treatment, observed on different days, indicating the role of micro-organisms present in fresh cowdung. Effect of other bacteria and actinomycetes strains was less effective. Phenol content with days of treatment: With increasing days of treatment, phenol content of tubers decreased. T recorded lesser phenol content whereas T4 recorded the maximum compared with other treatments. All the treatments recorded maximum phenol content at day '0'. Reducing sugar (RS) and total sugar (TS): With the increasing days of treatment, the amounts of reducing sugar and total sugar were decreased. All the treatments recorded maximum RS and TS content at the first day of treatment. Content on 30th day, lowest RS content (71 ug/g fresh weight) was recorded in T5. Protein content: With the increase in days of Table 4.

Among the treatments, T5 recorded highest protein content (262 ug/g fresh weight). Post-harvest tuber rot Five major pathogens that caused post-harvest rotting of dioscorea (yam) were identified. Of the five, four fungal pathogens, viz. Sclerotium rolfsii, Botryodiplodia theobromae, Fusarium and Rhizopus species caused considerable damage *o seed tubers of yam. One bacterial pathogen Erwinia carotovora was also found to cause damage to yam tubers. The reduction (%) in growth over the control was calculated on 3rd and 5th days and is presented in Table 6. It is evident that all the 4 cultures studied inhibited the growth of the pathogens tested in vitro. CONCLUSION Application of fresh cowdung to the cut tubers induced early sprouting. There was not much difference in sprouting behaviour beyond 30 days, and hence yam sets can be kept in nursery not more than 30 days before planting in the main fields.
