 Rice bean: • Pre‐emergence application of pendimethelin gives almost similar results as that of weed free treatment • In hills, intercropping rice bean with maize in 2:1 ratio resulted in highest rice bean equivalent yield, LER and B:C ratio. • Rice bean out yielded green gram and black gram for seed production at all locations except S.K. Nagar. For fodder production rice bean performed better than cowpea at Ranichauri while cowpea gave better performance than rice bean at Bangalore. www.icar.org.in 121 2002 ‐ 2007 • In peninsular India, growing pigeonpea and rice bean in 1: 2 row ratios resulted in highest rice bean equivalent yield , land equivalent ratio (1.34) and benefit cost ratio (2.10) Jatropha 2 x 1 m spacing and a fertilizer dose of N45P30K30 per ha resulted in highest seed yield Paradise tree Use of VAM culture @10g/poly bag helps to reduce nursery raising time from three months to one and a half month www.icar.org.in 122 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science All India Coordinated Sorghum Improvement Project 1.
