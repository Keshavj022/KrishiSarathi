The past and present observed datasets were obtained from Indian Meteorological Department, whereas the future datasets were obtained from d4PDF Scenarios. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was applied to analyse drought statistics to identify the worst-case drought scenario (i.e. year most affected by severe-to- extreme drought with high drought severity), which was used further to access precise drought risk. Because SPEI considers the effect of both rainfall and temperature and therefore it is the widely recommended meteoÂ­ rological drought indices and best suited for climate change impact assessment. Drought severity was analysed using a Multi-criteria assessment risk matrix, and the areas under higher agriculture drought risk were mapped. The frequency of droughts with higher intensity and magnitude increased in the present decade compared to the past three decades. 75% area showed higher vulnerability to drought risks, whereas only 25% showed lower risks and less vulnerability to drought occurrences.
