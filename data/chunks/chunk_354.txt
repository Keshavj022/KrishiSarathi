 Soil is mostly acidic in nature. Soil in north-east India consists of laterite and lateritic soil, red soil, and alluvial soil in the Brahmaputra valley, peat soils in wetlands. Wheat plant growth depends greatly on soil physical and chemical properties. Soils are highly acidic in nature in the most of North Eastern states. The pH is mostly less than 6.0 (in some areas pH is around Indian Farming 28 December 2023 Table 1.

Topography of this region ranges from fertile plains of Brahmaputra and Barak valley in Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Manipur while lower Himalayan Mountain ranges in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. Due to undulating topography, it becomes difficult to manage wheat crop operations from sowing to harvesting. Production technique in north- east India: Subsistence nature of farming prevails in north-eastern plains of India. Jhum cultivation or shifting cultivation prevails in hilly areas of north-east. Bari-system or homestead system of farming is the most important integration of farming system in Assam. Farmers of Brahmaputra and Barak valleys are mostly confined to cultivation of rice in kharif season and mustard/ potato/vegetables in rabi season. The package of practices for the wheat crop in the valley is hardly followed due to the acceptability of farmers to age old crop growing practices. Non- availability of companies or public infrastructure such as fertilizer plants, pesticide industry, tractor and modern equipment supplying agencies and seed industry are lacking in this region of the country. An oldest fertilizer plant at Namrup district of Assam is struggling for existence. Agriculture especially wheat crop cultivation in other parts of India is highly organized and commercial whereas North East India is not following the trend and struggling to attain required yield and productivity. Seed availability is poor in the region and farmers depends on neighbouring states for quality seed of newly released climate resilient, disease resistant and high-yielding varieties.
