 Under late sown conditions, it is advised to complete the sowing by 3rd week of December. Durum wheat varieties should be shown from last week of October to first week of November. High yielding varieties: For irrigated and timely sown conditions: WH 1105, WH 1184, WH 283, WH 542, HD 2967, HD 3086, DBW 88, DBW 187, DBW 222, PBW 550. For light textured soils and limited irrigation conditions: C-306, WH1025, WH 1080. Durum wheat varieties: WH 896, WH 912 HD 943. Seed treatment: Seed treatment is cost effective technology for management of seed and soil borne diseases. Treatment of seed with vitavax or bavistin 2g or raxil-2 DS (1g/kg seed) is advised ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 121 before sowing of the crop. For management of seed borne Karnal bunt disease, seed treatment with thiram (2g) or raxil-2 DS (1g/kg seed) should be done. For management of termite in light textured soils, treatment of seed with chloropyriphos 20 EC (1.5 ml/ kg seed) or ethion 50 EC (5 ml/ kg seed) should be done before treatment with above fungicide. Seed rate: Use 100 kg seed per hectare for sowing of the crop timely. Nutrient management: It is better to apply fertilizers on soil test basis. In absence of soil testing, it should be applied on basis of general recommendation. Apply 150 kg nitrogen (325 kg urea), 60 kg P2O5 (375 Kg SSP or 125 Kg DAP), 30 kg K2O (50 Kg MOP) and 25 kg ZnSO4 (21%) per hectare in irrigated crop. Apply half dose of N and full dose of P2O5, K20 and ZnSO4 at the time of sowing. Apply of 30 kg N (50 kg urea), 15 kgP2O5 (90 kg SSP for 33 kg DAP), 15kg K2O (25 kg MOP) and 25kg ZnSo4 (21%) the crop grown under limited irrigation availability. Apply all the fertilizers at the time of sowing. December Month Late sowing of wheat may be done up to 3rd week of December. Increase seed rate by 25% for late sown crop. Seed rate of 125 Kg/ ha is to be used for varieties having bold seed size. Do seed treatment as above mention method. Varieties recommended for irrigated and late sown condition are: WH 1124, DBW 90, HD 3059, WH 1021, PBW373, RAJ 3765. Apply first irrigation 21-22 DAS after sowing and broadcast remaining half dose (75 kg/ha) of N. Weed management: Wheat crop gets infested with both broad and narrow leafed weeds. Management of broadleaf weeds: Problem of broad leaf weeds occur in wheat crop where cotton-wheat, pearlmillet- wheat, clusterbean- wheat cropping systems are practiced. Bathua, kharbathua, gajri, jungali palak, piazi, krishan neel, senji, ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 122 hirankhuri, chatri-matri etc. are main broad leaf weeds which infest wheat crop. These weeds can be managed by application of following herbicides depending on type of weed flora: Apply 2,4-D Na salt (80%) @ 625 g/ha or2,4-D Ester (34.6 %) @ 750 ml/ha with 625-liter water at 30-35 days after sowing of the crop. Application of 2,4-D Na salt (80%) or2,4-D Ester (34.6 %) @ 1500 ml/ha is advised for the management of jungali palak, kandai and hirankhuri.
