 A Central Sector Scheme on “Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-situ Management of Crop Residue in States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi” has been approved by the Government of India and it is being operated through DoAC&FW. Budget allocated to the scheme was ` 1151.80 crore for two years (for 2018- 19: ` 591.65 crore, and for 2019-2020; ` 560.15 crore) and it is further extended for one more year (2020-21) with a budgetary allocation of ` 600 crores. Baling and transporting straw from the field, though appear to be an option for safe disposal, will be feasible only when alternate, effective and economically viable usage methods are identified and facilities and infrastructure for ex-situ management methods are created. The Secretary, DARE and DG, ICAR constituted a committee for the economic analysis of the alternative / ex-situ options of the crop residue management. Following are the various options for Ex-situ management of crop residues considered by the committee and the respective recommendations of the committee: Executive Summary 2 Ex-situ Crop Residue Management Options Biomass pellets from crop residues as a fuel substitution in thermal power plants This option is recommended for further consideration. Substituting biomass pellets from crop residues at the rate of 10% of the coal, will increase the cost of production by 20 paisa per unit of power. If all the existing power plants in North India (with an installed capacity of 44,560 MW) substitute their fuel with paddy straw based pellets then they will consume 17.82 million tons of paddy straw every year. Nearly the entire problem will be solved. There is no additional expenditure or subsidy needed from Government. Biogas production from paddy straw at domestic/community level This option is recommended for further consideration. Cost of PAU Model–II biogas plant is ` 2.1 lakhs and its life is 20 years. For a breakeven on expenditure for the farmer the government need to extend a onetime support at the rate of 60% of the cost of the plant. If one biogas plant per farm in Punjab is established then the budget required for one time subsidy will be ` 13,860 crores (for nearly 1.1 million land holdings). These 1.1 million biogas plants will consume 5.28 million tons of paddy straw every year. Industrial level production of Biogas / Bio-CNG / Compressed Bio- gas (CBG) from Paddy Straw This option is recommended for further consideration. Cost of establishing one bio-CNG plant with a capacity of 5,600 kg of bio-CNG per day will be ` 30.20 crores. Such a plant will consume 40 tons of paddy straw every day or 11000 tonne in a year with 275 working days. If 50% of the cost of plant and machinery are supported by the Government then the annual profit will be ` 209.23 lakhs per year. If 1,000 such plants are established then support at the rate of 50% will cause an expenditure of ` 15,100 crores to the Government.
