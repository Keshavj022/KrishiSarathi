Guidelines for Testing Crop Varieties under the All- India Coordinated Crop Improvement Projects, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi, India.  Foreword The All-India Coordinated Crop Improvement Projects (AICCIPs) have played a critical role in the development of a large number of crop varieties adapted to various ecologies and regions. The mandate of the AICCIP is to develop stable high-yielding varieties with better quality and improved resistance/ tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Since the establishment of the first AICCIP on Maize in 1957, this model has been extended to 20 crop-based AICCIPs of all major field crops. The network of the AICCIPs is a unique feature in the National Agricultural Research and Education System, where all organizations and institutes involved in the genetic improvement of the crops contribute their potential materials for testing at a large number of locations, based on the zonalization. Such a testing mechanism provides ample opportunity to evaluate materials for their agronomic performance under a wide range of environmental conditions and for assessing their reactions to various diseases and insect-pests across different agroclimatic zones. The AICCIPs have strengthened further networking between various ICAR institutes, state agricultural universities, central and state research institutes and private sector. As a result, tremendous progress has been made, which is evident from enhanced productivity of crop-plants.
