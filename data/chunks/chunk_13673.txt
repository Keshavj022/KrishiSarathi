 Pulses are currently cultivated as the sole crop in the irrigated belts of western Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and north-western Rajasthan as a result of these efforts. As for other crops, farmers focused on horticultural crops and spices due to its high demand and higher return than the traditional crops. In addition, under the organic-certiﬁcation process (registered under National Pro- gramme for Organic Production), the cultivable area increased from 5710.38 thousand hector in 2015–2016 to 4339.18 thousand hector in 2020–2021. Among all the states, Madhya Pradesh (1637.37 thousand hector) covered the largest area under organic certiﬁcation, followed by Rajasthan (481.86 thousand hector), Maharashtra (371.8 thousand hector), Chhattisgarh (286.68 thousand hector), Himachal Pradesh (203.74 thousand hector), Jammu & Kashmir (192.77 thousand hector), and Karnataka (174.42 thousand hector) [16].

Crop Diversiﬁcation Index (Shannon-Wiener Index) As we have mentioned in the methodology, to understand the change in the cropping pattern across states, Shannon-Wiener indexes for the years 1971–1972 to 2017–2018 were estimated and shown in Figure 1. The diversiﬁcation index varies greatly among the states of India. Crop diversiﬁcation improved in several states in the North-East (e.g., Arunachal Pradesh), the western part of the nation (e.g., Gujarat, Uttarakhand), the southern part of the country (e.g., Tamandu, Kerala), and the eastern region of the country (e.g., West Bengal). On the other side, there was no substantial trend in crop diversiﬁcation in states like Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh. Interestingly, the largest as well as major agricultural-dominating states in the northern region, such as Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab, experienced more crop concentration. However, in the southern part of the country, Kerala and Tamil Nadu experienced crop diversiﬁcation over the years. 0 0 0 0 Figure 1.
