His vision of agriculture and rural development is globally acclaimed as a strategy for inclusive growth and collective governance. Development of agro-industries in the villages, upscaling of rural innovations and empowerment of people through skill development and education were central to the prosperity of rural areas and poverty reduction. The global experience has shown that the countries following the path of decentralization and rural industrialization have achieved faster economic growth and reduction in poverty.
