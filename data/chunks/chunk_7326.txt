 KBMB 1) and horsegram (var. GPM 6) under semi-arid (hot dry), vertisols/ 30 days delay in onset (Vijayapura). On an average, these varie- ties gave about 15–35% higher yields compared to lo- cal/farmers’ varieties under delayed onset of monsoon. Drought-prone multi-stress tolerant rice genotype for rainfed areas: A medium duration high yielding rice genotype IET 24306 (Swarna Samriddhi Dhan) was identified for rainfed areas of Bihar. This variety is suitable for cultivation under transplanted condition in irrigated as well as rainfed shallow lowland ecology of Bihar. Swarna Samriddhi Dhan is semi-dwarf, high yielding (5.5–6.0 t/ha), medium duration (135–140 days), multiple stresses (drought, submergence, disease and insect pest) tolerant, lodging resistant with desirable cooking quality traits and having long slender grain type. Quality wise, Swarna Samriddhi Dhan possesses 77.8% hulling, 62.0% milling, 55.6% head rice recovery (HRR) with desirable intermediate alkali spreading value, amylose content (24.33%) with long slender grain type. Besides drought tolerant, this variety can also tolerate 10–12 days submergence. NICRA Aerobic Dhan 1: This is a medium early duration, 100 cm tall erect, highly vigorous, non lodging, non-shattering and dark green in colour. Plants NICRA Aerobic Dhan 1/TRC 2015-5 (IET 26178) field view, paddy and milled rice come to flowering within 85–86 days, produce good biomass, long panicle, and have short bold grain with white kernel (length 5.72 mm, breadth 2.3 mm and suitable for cultivation in upland/aerobic conditions of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka. Grain quality is very good (hulling 76.55%, milling 68.6%, head rice recovery 65.9%, amylase content 22.18, gel consistency 34.5). Yield increase ranged from 5.26 to 18.41%, 11.72–30.58% and 22.03–75.95% in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka, respectively. Climate change impact on runoff and soil losses under different farming systems in Umiam, Meghalaya: Effect of projected climate change scenarios on runoff and soil losses under different farming system combinations in the eight micro- watersheds at ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Umiam, Meghalaya revealed an increasing CLIMATE CHANGE AND RESILIENT AGRICULTURE ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 16 losses across all eight micro-watersheds under both low-to-high emission scenarios. Among the eight micro- watersheds, horticulture based IFS was relatively more resilient to climate change induced soil erosion and sediment losses. Micro-controlled solar tunnel drier for heavy rainfall region of Northeast India: A solar smart tunnel drier of dimension 6×5 m was designed to have a capacity of drying 100 kg raw sliced turmeric/ ginger in 12 trays. A microcontroller regulates the temperature and the humidity inside the tunnel drier and displayed in the attached screen. The system has capacity to rise inside temperature by 79% (up to 53.8°C in 3 days) and reduce humidity by 50% (up to 37.
