, 2020; Hashemzadeh Ghalhari et al., 2022). As per VHI majority of the area in ACZ II and III was free from drought but NVSWI and SPI captured the drought episodes efficiently in these zones. Punjab and Haryana witnessed a prolonged period of analogously low wheat yield from the year 2002-03 to 2010-11 (Mukherjee et al., 2010), the distri­ bution maps of NVSWI (Fig. 8) and GPP (Fig. 7) also indicated their lower values from 2001 to 2011 in ACZ I and ACZ III. The GPP of vegetation is controlled by water availability (Wang et al., 2018a: Zhang et al., 2018b; Walther et al., 2019), thus its high correlation with NVSWI also supports the effectiveness of NVSWI in capturing the drought events. High correlation between NVSWI and VHI and GPP indicated that increased low soil moisture content also impact the vegetation dynamics and organic carbon in crop biomass. Since, Low correlation between NVSWI and SPI reflected less impact of meteorological drought on irri­ gated areas. The outcome of NVSWI and SPI correlation in the present investigation are consistent with the study conducted by Ambika and Mishra (2019), which also demonstrated the high correlation (r) be­ tween NVSWI and SPI in non-irrigated and lower correlation (r) in irrigated agricultural regions of the Indo-Gangetic plains. Groundwater based irrigation dominates the western parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (i.e., Haryana and Punjab), which has been the main cause for the declining groundwater levels in Punjab and Haryana (Rodell et al., 2009; Mishra et al., 2016; Asoka et al., 2017; Kaur and Rishi, 2018; Mishra et al., 2018; Kaur et al., 2020). Irrigation in ACZ II and III is mainly dependent on groundwater and high agricultural production resulted in decline in groundwater level. Thus, with increased frequency of droughts and rapidly declining groundwater levels in Punjab and Haryana, crop production may decrease and food security may be jeopardized. 5. Conclusion As per the results of SPI, ACZ III witnessed maximum drought epi­ sodes as compared to ACZ I and II. The driest years were 2002–03 (ACZ I), 2014–15 (ACZ II), and 2016–17 (ACZ III), respectively. The spatio- temporal maps of NVSWI were suggestive that NDVI and LST can have the potential to detect vegetation health and soil moisture which can be used for agricultural drought monitoring. The NVSWI indicated that during the 2002–03 drought event, a major part of all the ACZs expe­ rienced severe to slight agricultural drought. According to the spatial distribution map of SPI, drought was observed in the southeastern part of ACZ II, and the area that had the lowest rainfall also indicated the lowest NVSWI. In ACZ III, the spatial distribution map of SPI-12 indi­ cated meteorological drought and NVSWI also exhibited severe to slight agricultural drought in this zone. The SPI map also showed that the year 2018–19 was a normal year in terms of meteorological drought and the same was supported by NVSWI.
