58%, respectively) than those with manual irrigation (1.52% N, 0.16% P, and 1.21% K). Consequently, 15% higher yield (69.84 t/ha), quality fruits (with higher TSS and lower acidity), and water productivity (40% higher) were obtained with the sensor-based irrigation system.

SUMMARY Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are now integrated into every business operation. Technological advancements must be integrated into high-value horticulture crops in order to make it more productive and sustainable. Implementing IoT-based smart irrigation systems in fruit crops can enhance water and fertilizer-use efficiency. The use of IoT-based smart sensing systems in farms may assist farmers in better understanding their crops, increasing input efficiency. These AI and machine learning-based solutions are being used successfully in protected fruit and vegetable Impact of IoT based irrigation system IoT based smart irrigation system Novemberâ€“December 2024 21 farming around the world. The appropriate use of these technologies contributes to the conservation of agricultural inputs, improved crop growth and yield, energy conservation, effective management of labour shortages, and lower production costs. However, these smart irrigation systems come with their own set of pros and constraints. Effective and economically feasible smart irrigation systems can be an alternative to traditional flood and drip irrigation systems. Indeed, smart irrigation is the future of environment friendly sustainable farming in locations with limited irrigation water supply. For further interaction, please write to: Dr I.
