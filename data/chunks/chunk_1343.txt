 This situation has made it challenging for farmers to recoup their investment in maize cultivation due to various issues, including interference from animals such as monkeys, wild pigs, peacocks, and wild Indian Farming 74 (10): 34-36; October 2024 cows. These animals have caused significant harm to the maize and wheat crops, leading to a notable decline in crop yields. To address this issue, farmers were advised to transition to cultivating okra, as this crop is less attractive to wild animals due to the numerous small spines on okra plants that can irritate skin. To promote okra cultivation among the farmers, the FFP team from SKUAST, Jammu organized various extension activities, including group discussions, training programs, frontline demonstrations, and field days. These training programs covered scientific methods for cultivating okra, kharif vegetables, insect pest management, and weed management, benefiting the okra growers. A total of 184 farmers participated in these extension activities. Additionally, frontline demonstrations of high-yielding okra varieties, such as TL-5A and Selly Special, were conducted on 56 farmersâ€™ fields, covering an area of 2.8 hectares from 2019-20 to 2023-24. This initiative aimed to build confidence among farmers who had become discouraged by maize crop losses, leading some to either leave their fields fallow or continue farming solely to retain ownership of the land. Field days were organized to reassure farmers that okra could be successfully grown in the area during the rainy season with little to no irrigation. Furthermore, Indian Farming 35 October 2024 farmers were encouraged by comparing the net profit from okra to that from maize. The FFP team also assisted farmers in establishing market linkages to sell surplus okra produce The average area under okra was 1.65 kanals/farmer in 2021, which increased to 2.75 kanals/farmer in 2024, representing a 67% increase over time. In contrast, the area under maize cultivation decreased by 18%. The average area for maize was 6.31 kanals/farmer in 2021, which declined to 5.16 kanals/farmer in 2024. The efforts of the FFP team are now yielding positive results, as farmers who previously left their fields fallow or cultivated maize have started shifting towards okra cultivation.
