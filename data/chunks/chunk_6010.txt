 After fertilization, the pedicel elongates rapidly and enters the ground, where the ovary begins to develop into a pod, maturing in about 2 months. Pods or nuts cylindrical, hard, reticulated, indehiscent and inflated, 2.5-5.0 cm long, 1-3 seeded, with the pericarp constricted between the seeds. Seed covered by a light or deep reddish brown seed coat, and consisting of two white fleshy cotyledons rich in oil and protein. The origin of groundnut is still uncertain. The restricted distribution of recent species in the central part of South America indicates that the original home and the centre of distribution of the genus may be in this area. Groundnut is believed to be native to Brazil. Groundnut was cultivated as early as 950 B.C. by the Indians in Brazil and Peru; it spread to Argentina, from where it was introduced into Jamaica, Cuba and other West Indies islands. It was probably brought to Africa from Brazil by the Portuguese early in the sixteenth century. It was taken to Asia somewhat later from the west coast of South America.
