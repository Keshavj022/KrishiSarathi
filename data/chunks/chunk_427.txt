But indiscriminate use of agro-chemicals, resulted in deterioration of soil health leading to shift in emphasis towards sustainable agriculture. Microorganisms play a major role in keeping soils live through its ecosystem services like solubilization of minerals, recycling of organic matter, bioremediation and soil formation. Therefore, use of biofertilizers for nutrient management is the best intervention for sustainable agriculture. Biofertilizers consist of different plant associated microorganisms that enhance plant growth and improve yield and quality of the agriculture crops through supply of nutrients.
