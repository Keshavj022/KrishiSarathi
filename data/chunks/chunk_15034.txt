 A village is classified by program administration as unconnected if it is located at least 500 m away from an all-weather road or from another village with an all-weather road. A village is classified as program-eligible in the study period if it is unconnected and has a village population greater than 500. Outcomes are constructed using the 1999 REDS village survey (column 1) and OMMS, the PMGSY administrative database (column 2). Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. *𝑝< 0.10, **𝑝< 0.05, ***𝑝< 0.01. the total number of person-days worked in the casual labor market for non-agriculture by all members of the household. Among program-eligible households treated by the program (panel A), there is a 15 percentage point decline in cultivation, though this effect is not statistically significant (column 1). When I decompose the effect, I find that the decline is much larger for households in villages close to towns — there is a 40 percentage point reduction in cultivation (column 2), and the F-test 𝑝-value of joint significance is 0.006. This decline in cultivation is accompanied by an increase of 129 person-days worked in non-agriculture (column 4). For households further away from towns, there is no significant exit from cultivation or change in the number of person-days worked in the casual labor market for non- agriculture. A similar pattern emerges for incidental households treated by the program (panel B) – a decline in cultivation and an increase in person-days worked in non-agriculture for households in villages close to towns – though these effects are not statistically significant. These patterns are similar when I pool direct and incidentally treated house- holds (panel C).24 The effect size that I find is similar in magnitude to the effect size in Asher and Novosad (2020) — they find a 9 percentage point reduction in the share of workers in agriculture. Taken together, these results suggest that improvements in road connectivity induce movement out of agriculture,25 but only in villages within close proximity to the non-agricultural sector. This, in turn, results in a change in composition of households that remain in agricul- ture in these villages. I focus on remote villages far from towns, where there are no compositional changes, in order to isolate the impacts of road infrastructure on agricultural productivity. To maximize power, I use the pooled Eq. (8) for the remainder of my analysis and I restrict 24 In Appendix Table B4, I present estimates on the impact of improvements in rural road infrastructure on households’ activity status, restricting the sample to program-eligible villages only in panel A, and to incidental villages only in panel B. The pattern of results is very similar to those in Table 3, as described above. 25 In addition to movement across sectors, improvements in road infrastruc- ture could have also induced individuals and/or households to migrate outside the village.
