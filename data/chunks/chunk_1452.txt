 The size of the Jalkund varies based on the requirements and resources of the farm households, typically measuring 90 m³, 45 m³, 35 m³, 30 m³, 20 m³, Indian Farming 74 (11): 65-67; November 2024 Indian Farming 66 November 2024 10 m³ in water storage capacity. The most common sizes found in the region are Jalkunds with capacities of 30-35 m³, with typical dimensions of 5 × 6 × 1 m or 5 × 6 × 1.5 m. The primary source of water for Jalkund is direct rainfall, which is abundant in the region (average rainfall: 3,000 mm). However, farmers have also employed innovative methods to harvest water by channelizing outflows from rooftops, community water pipes, and natural water streams from the hills. The cost of construction depends on the size of the Jalkund and the thickness of the lining material, such as Silpaulin or HDPE sheets. Key steps in constructing a Jalkund Site selection: The first step is to select a suitable site for constructing the Jalkund, ensuring that it can efficiently harvest rainwater and, if possible, collect water from additional sources. The site should be easily accessible for farm activities, ensuring that the stored water can be used for various purposes such as critical irrigation, livestock, and domestic needs. Digging the pond: Clear the site of any bushes, debris, or other obstructions. Mark the dimensions of the Jalkund using lime or other coloured markers. The pond can be dug manually or using an earth mover machine, based on the required dimensions. Plastering the inner lining and bottom: Once the pond is dug, apply a mixture of clay and cow dung slurry to the inner walls and the bottom of the pond. This plaster helps to smooth the surface, creating a level base and walls. It also enhances the durability of the lining material. Cushioning the inner Lining: To further protect the lining material, spread locally available cushioning materials such as paddy straw, sawdust, broom grass, dried turmeric leaves, pine leaves, banana leaves, or similar organic matter. A 10-15 cm thick layer of this material should be spread across the walls and bottom of the pond. Lining the silpaulin/HDPE sheets: Once the cushioning is in place, spread the Silpaulin or HDPE sheets (with a minimum thickness of 250 GSM) along the sides and bottom of the Jalkund. Ensure that the sides of the sheets are placed securely in a 30 cm deep trench around the Jalkund, to prevent the sheet from slipping out or becoming displaced.

Planting perennial grasses along the edges of the Jalkund helps stabilize the soil, further protecting it from erosion.
