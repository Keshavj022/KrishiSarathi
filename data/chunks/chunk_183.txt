The apiary unit established at the KVK was strengthened from 13 bee hive colonies to 120 and honey (on an average 700 kg per month) and bee colonies are sold to farmers and aspiring bee farmers. KVK, Venkataramannagudem in collaboration with ITDA, K R Puram formed 9 individual cluster groups of bee keepers covering 11 villages and these individual cluster groups in turn formed an association of honey producers with the name 'Giridhara Honey Producers Society 'in ITDA, K R Puram for production, marketing of honey and strengthening of bee keeping. Branding of the product and FSSAI registration has been completed.
