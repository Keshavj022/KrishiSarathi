 The analysis using the multilocus genetic data revealed that the values were 0.000 meaning that the null hypothesis is accepted i.e. the populations are in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium and there is no deviation from HW equilibrium. Genetic distance and genetic identity: Nei’s original measure of genetic identity and genetic distance - Nei’s genetic distances between Nicobari and Miri is 0.7546 and between Nicobari and Aseel is 0.8433. The genetic distance between Miri and Aseel is 0.9821. The genetic identity between Nicobari and Miri, Nicobari and Aseel, and Miri and Aseel has been 0.4702, 0.4303 and 0.3745 respectively. The unbiased measures of genetic identity and genetic distance were also calculated. The dendrograms of Nei’s 1972, Nei’s 1972 unbiased and Nei’s minimum distance were prepared. Linkage disequilibrium: The linkage disequilibrium that represents the association between microsatellite loci or alleles was conducted for the three populations. The LD=1 was found between ADL-102 and ADL-158 in Nicobari population. The LD values were 7 and 6 for Miri and Aseel poultry respectively. At least three values i.e. 2 for ADL-136, 1 for ADL-210 and 2 for ADL-176 showed linkage disequilibrium with MCW-14, HUJ-7, ADL-210, ADL-23 and MCW-59. ANIMAL BREEDING CATTLE Crossbred Cattle Frieswal: Under the Frieswal project the present cattle population consists of 22,744 females including 11,501 Frieswals, 8,567 higher crosses and 2,676 lower crosses located at 43 military farms. Military Farm, Meerut, has the maximum number of Frieswals (1,509). The present strength of elite cows at various military farms is 673. Breeding values of 36 Frieswal bulls was evaluated based on the progeny’s first lactation milk yield. The top eight bulls (20% of total) with their breeding values were Nashila (2,915.33 kg), Khan (2,904.36 kg), Gajraj (2,885.24 kg), Karan (2,882.63 kg), Rustam (2,882.37 kg), Hira (2,881.27 kg) and Robila (2,877.42 kg). The production traits such as lactation yield, 300 days milk yield, lactation length and peak yield of Frieswal cows were 3,146.12 ± 79.42 kg, 3,011.31 ± 73.66 kg, 317.67 ± 9.15 days and 14.53 ± 0.36 kg, respectively. The average age and weight at first calving, dry period, service period and calving interval of Frieswal cows were 987.71 ± 10.59 days and 360.15 ± 4.24 kg, 110.73 ± 11.23 days, 179.36 ± 13.80 days and 426.86 ± 13.97 days, respectively. The average daily body weight gain (g) of growing Frieswal bull calves maintained at various levels of feeding 100% P × 100% E, 100%P × 120% E, 120% P × 100% E, 120% P × 120% E of NRC 1989 and Military Farm feeding scales were 598, 710, 667, 667 and 524 g, respectively. The best result was obtained in feeding of 100% protein and 120% energy levels of NRC 1989. Field progeny testing: Under this project semen of Frieswal bulls is being used for progeny testing of crossbred bulls under field conditions at 3 different places in India, viz.
