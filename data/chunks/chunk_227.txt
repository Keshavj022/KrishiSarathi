 Challenges Major challenges in pulses production • Biotic stresses: Diseases: Wilt, root rot complex, MYMV Insect pests: pod borer, Maruca • Abiotic stresses: Drought, terminal heat, salinity, frost, water-logging • Climate change: Unpredictable weather conditions and extreme events • Shrinking agricultural land • Growing population with high demand of protein Major achievements and its impact A number of area and season specific varieties have been developed in different pulses which are not only high yielding but are also resistant to most of the disease and insect-pests. These varieties have proven their potential in farmers’ fields as also in large scale demonstrations. It has been demonstrated that improved varieties of pulses have a positive impact of 15-20% in increasing pulses production in all major pulse crops including chickpea, mungbean, urdbean and lentil while in pigeonpea, improved varieties increased the yield by 10-12%. As a result of planned and concerted efforts, several breakthrough achievements were recorded in the research front including reduction in crop duration: [mungbean (75 to 55 days), lentil (140 to 120 days), chickpea (135 to 110 days)]; increase in seed size (100-seed weight) of Kabuli chickpea from 35 to 55 g; development of YMV resistant, non-shattering and synchronous varieties in mungbean and urdbean; development of high input responsive, wilt resistant varieties in chickpea and early maturing and machine harvestable varieties in pigeonpea for multiple cropping; development of green seeded variety in field pea and bio-fortified varieties in lentil and chickpea. Hybrids were successfully developed and adopted in pigeonpea besides development of cultivars in the backgrounds of most successful chickpea varieties of past years through marker assisted breeding. Since the inception of Pulses research network in India, more than 775 high yielding varieties with resistance to major biotic and abiotic disease have been developed. Some of the landmark varieties developed by the NARS of pulses are given in Table 6. Further, a large number of crop production, management and protection technologies have been developed for pulses whose potential has been shown in large scale demonstrations as well. Such technologies include: • Weed management through application of Pendimethaline (30 EC) @ 1.0 Kg a.i./ha as pre- emergence application and Imazethapyr @ 70-80 g/ha as Table 5.
