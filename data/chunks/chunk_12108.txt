Trend of seat filling indicates decreasing interest of students towards Animal Sciences side subjects. Under 3 Major subjects, there were 5 sub- subjects in which less than 50% seats were filled (Table-12) which is a matter of concern considering the future need for teaching and research in these areas. The highest number of 170 female candidates (out of 351 admitted candidates) took admission in Plant Sciences followed by 142 (out of 275) in Veterinary Science, 113 (out of 227) in Horticulture and 112 (out of 212) in Social Sciences (Table-13). Based upon their merit in AIEEA (PG)-2019, the ICAR PG Scholarship, @ `12,640 per month + contingent grant of `6000/ per year was awarded to 600 candidates (100%) for pursuing postgraduate studies for a period of two years who got admission in universities located in states other than those from where they had graduated.
