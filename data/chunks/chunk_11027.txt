Just as biofertilizers are emerging as green alternative to chemical fertilizers, biopesticides have a huge role to play in sustainable management of crop pests and pathogens. In contrast to chemical pesticides, application of ecofriendly biopesticides does not lead to development of any resistance in pests and pathogens. Still this sustainable alternative is struggling to find its place in the market over its chemical counterpart owing to technological challenges and acceptance among the farming community. National Policy for Farmers (NPF), 2007, which aims to improve economic viability of farming and increase net income of farmers, strongly recommends the promotion of biopesticides. In spite of these efforts the biopesticides represent only 4.2% of the overall pesticide market in India compared to 40% in USA and 20% each in Europe and Oceanic countries.
