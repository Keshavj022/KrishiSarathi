 Under ideal conditions, the rate of fertilization is generally 90-95%.  Eggs hatch in 18-22 h at a water temperature of 28-30ºC and yolk-sac is absorbed in 72 h, and the free-swimming spawn of size 5-6 mm is developed with a hatching rate of 70%.  Spawn is reared to fry size (20-25 mm) at a density of 500-1000/m2 in earthen nursery for 15-20 days with 30-35% survival. Concrete tanks at stocking density of 1000-2000 spawn/m3 yields better survival of 50-80%.  The breeding technology is widely practiced in all the states of the country.

Brooders of 2+ year-classes are raised in earthen ponds along with other carps. Induced spawning is undertaken during monsoon months.  Sexual dimorphism becomes clear in the spawning season. Females have bulged abdomen and soft pectoral fins, whereas males are slender, having rough pectoral fins and oozes milky- white milt from the vent.  Captive spawning is undertaken either in hapa or hatchery. In both cases a sex ratio of 1:1 (number and weight) is recommended. Brooders are induced spawned by injecting either pituitary extract (PE) or commercially available synthetic gonadotropin hormones (CH) such as Ovaprim/ Ovatide/ Ovulin/ Gonopro/ WOVA-FH.  PE to females is administered in two doses. First dose of 2-3 mg/kg and 2nd dose of 6-8 mg/ kg body weight is injected within an interval of 6-8 h. Males are given a single dose of 2-3 mg/ kg. However, in case of CH, a single dose of 0.5-0.6 ml/kg to female and approximately half of the dose (0.2-0.3 ml/kg) that is administered to female is given to male.  After 6-8 h of hormone administration, egg and spermatozoa are stripped out into a dry bowl/tray and mixed for fertilization. One kg female lay around 0.8-1.0 lakh eggs. Rate of fertilization is generally 50-60%. Eggs are kept for hatching either in hatching hapa or incubation chambers of hatchery.  Yolk-sac of the hatchling is absorbed in 65-76 h at a water temperature of 28-30ºC and free- swimming spawn (size 5-6 mm) is developed with a hatching rate of more than 70%.  Spawn is reared to fry size (20-25 mm) at 500-1000/m2 density in prepared earthen nursery for 15-20 days with 30-35% survival. Concrete tanks at stocking density of 1000-2000 spawn/m3 yields better survival of 50-80%.  The breeding technology has been widely adopted in all the states of the country.
