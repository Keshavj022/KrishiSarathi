 Training and operation • Operator training: Provide thorough training for hatchery operators on the use of equipment, egg handling, and maintenance procedures. Regular updates on best practices and new technologies are beneficial. • Record keeping: Maintain detailed records of incubation conditions, hatch rates, chick health, and equipment maintenance. This helps in identifying trends and addressing issues promptly. • Emergency procedures: Develop and implement emergency procedures for power outages, equipment failures, and disease outbreaks. Ensure all staff are familiar with these procedures. Environmental considerations • Temperature control: Ensure the hatchery environment is climate-controlled to prevent extreme temperatures that can affect incubation conditions. • Waste management: Implement effective waste management practices to handle and dispose of waste materials, including egg shells and dead chicks, in an environmentally friendly manner. By adhering to these precautions, you can establish and operate a hatchery unit that is efficient, reliable, and capable of producing healthy chicks. Proper planning, ongoing maintenance, and adherence to best practices are key to the successful management of a hatchery unit. *Corresponding author email: p.mooventhan@icar.gov.in Table 1.
