 Popularization of State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 71 mechanizations like modified method of planting viz., spaced transplanting technique, ring-pit, trench and FIRB methods.   Ratoon management: Ratooning covers almost 50% of cane acreage in the State and is an integral component of the sugarcane production system. However, despite higher sugar content in ratoon, its productivity is 30-40% less as compared to that of plant crop owing to negligence from the farmers for management point of view. Popularization of ratoon management techniques like deep planting (25 cm), trash mulching, gap filling, intercropping, etc. is required to increase sugarcane productivity and profitability. Widespread dissemination of water saving technologies like trench planting, , micro-irrigation techniques like drip irrigation results in water saving and raising the sugarcane yield by 30-40 %. Strategy 5. Crop Diversification (in all Zones) In order to mitigate the adverse effect of climate change on agricultural crops, improve soil health and to increase the farmer’s income, following crop diversification models need to be promoted.   Inclusion of summer greengram in rice-wheat system.   Diversification of rice-wheat system with inclusion of vegetables for higher income in peri-urban areas, as well as in drought prone upland areas where rice productivity is very less due to low rainfall (e.g. Jamui, Banka, Nawada districts).   Inclusion of climate resilient, drought-tolerant nutri-cereals like sorghum, pearl millets, finger millets, foxtail millets etc. in drought affected regions of Zone III A and Zone IIIB.   Inclusion of Soybean and Groundnut (in Koshi region) in place of upland rice.   Inclusion of pulses like lentil and lathyrus, and oilseeds like linseed and safflower in rice- fallow areas of Zone 3A&B.   Intercropping of pulses like lentil, chickpea, greengram etc. oilseeds like linseed and mustard, vegetables like onion, garlic, coriander, etc in sugarcane based production system in Zone I; and pigeonpea with maize in Zone I and Zone IIIA&B.   Inclusion of floriculture in peri-urban areas. Strategy 6. Water Resources Management (Zone IIIA)   Construction of various beneficial structures under the Run off management program.   Promotion of agro forestry/social forestry and arid horticulture in rainfed and other areas for environmental protection and increase in rainfall through plantation of forestry and fruit trees.   Development of required water conservation structures for soil moisture protection / recharge of ground water. Construction of check dam in rain-fed areas and construction of irrigation-wells in sub-plateau.   Restoration of traditional water sources and water storage structures.
