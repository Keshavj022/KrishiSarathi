 Higher temperatures lead to an increase in thermal decomposition reactions, giving rise to an increase in hydrogen production [39]. Maintaining the right balance is crucial, as excessively high temperatures can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts. Figure 3 illustrates the fast pyrolysis which emphasizes the range of biomass-generated products with temperature [40]. Figure 3.

Extended residence times enable more thorough thermal decomposition, potentially increasing hydrogen productivity. Optimizing residence time requires careful analysis of various parameters such as biomass feedstock, reactor design, temperature profiles, and cost concerns. By Addressing these elements, Hydrogen production can be maximized while minimizing unwanted byproducts and operational costs, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of biomass pyrolysis for hydrogen generation [41-44]. 4.3 Reaction route Biomass pyrolysis employs various routes that affect hydrogen productivity. Analyzing reaction kinematics is crucial for enhancing hydrogen production. By studying these kinematics, researchers can identify the relationship between temperature and time, allowing for a specific adjustment that improves hydrogen production [45,46]. Understanding the chemical route also enables precise control over conditions to favor hydrogen-rich output and minimize unwanted by-products. Catalysts are important in boosting hydrogen production by promoting steam reforming processes. Additionally, Temperature and pressure variations also have an impact on the thermodynamics and kinematics processes, opening up new chances for optimization [47]. 4.4 Biochemical Ingredients The use of enzymes in biomass pyrolysis can impact reaction rate and selectivity, both of which are essential for boosting hydrogen productivity. Catalyst not only promotes the degradation but also steer the process toward the formation of hydrogen-rich molecules. Researchers are investigating some materials, including zeolites and transition metals, for improving the effectiveness of catalytic reactions. By adding catalysts, biomass pyrolysis can be optimized for efficient and sustainable hydrogen generation, which advances the development of renewable energy solutions [48,49]. 4.5 Feedstock composition The selection of biomass feedstock is critical for hydrogen production through biomass pyrolysis, which is influenced by various technical aspects. The nature of the biomass, the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, has a direct impact on hydrogen production during thermal decomposition.
