Post-harvest management and storage After sufficient drying in the sun threshed clean seeds should be stored in appropriate bins or gunny bags. For safe storage moisture content should be 9-10 percent in field pea, 8 percent in rapeseed and 8-10 percent in Linseed. Horticultural Crops Prepare nursery for cole crops (Broccoli, Cabbage, Cauliflower, knoll khol, radish, turnip etc.) and other vegetables like chilli and tomato during the month of August-September. Prepare raised seed bed of about 10-15 cm above the ground on a fine tilth soil with well decomposed FYM with a size of 1m width and of convenient length or raise in pro-tray with coco peat and Vermicompost media in a ratio 1:1. Prepare the field for winter vegetables by ploughing 2-3 times to make friable soil and incorporate 10-15t/ha well decomposed FYM. Transplant 30–40-day old seedlings to the main field or when the seedlings attain 3-4 leaf stage with a spacing of 45x30 cm for early and 60x45 cm for mid and late season crops. Start sowing of winter vegetables like French bean, carrot, pea etc in the month of October and complete the sowing by 15th November. Irrigate the field regularly to avoid moisture stress and get maximum yield. Use paddy straw or dry leaves for mulching to conserve moisture and control weeds. Kiwi can be propagated through hard wood cutting in the month of December – January. One-year-old matured and dormant ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 293 shoots of the preceding summer growth having 2 – 3 nodes are selected. The cuttings are planted in moist coarse texture media with 2 nodes below and 1 or 2 nodes above. Care should be taken that male and female plants are identified and planted separately Insect pest management Clip aphids infested shoots or parts in the early stage. Collect and destroy the egg masses, grubs, and gregarious early instar larvae in the cropped area. Install yellow and blue sticky trap @ 6 traps/acre at crop canopy level to monitor the sucking pest population In the early stage of infestation spray the NSKE or Neem oil @ 4% or Spinosad @ 0.75ml/L of water in the initial infestation. If infestation of the leaf feeders/ caterpillars and borers are high spray anyone of the following insecticides, Emamectin benzoate 5% SG @ 0.4 g/L or Flubendiamide 39.35% SC @ 0.5ml/L of water If the incidence of sucking pests persist (Aphids, Thrips, whiteflies and bugs) spray anyone of the following insecticides, Imidacloprid 200 SL @ 0.5 ml/L or Thiomethoxam 25 WP @ 0.3 g/L or Fipronil 5 SC @1ml/L of water.
