 The major digital initiatives during the year were: yy Kisan Sarathi (System of Agri-information Resources Auto-transmission and Technology Hub Interface) is an ICT based platform for two-way multi-lingual communication system between farmers and agricultural experts for transmission of agricultural technology/information and advisory in the form of Text, Images, Audios and Videos. The platform was launched on July 16, 2021 as pilot scheme. Under pilot project, 243 KVKs and 1067 agricultural experts are registered to support 20.14 lakh registered farmers of 50178 villages in six states. Currently 731 KVKs and 3130 agriculture experts have been registered to implement the scheme across the country. yy Developed more than 300 Mobile Apps and integrated them into a single Mobile App i.e., KISSAN 2.0 for dissemination of desired technical knowledge to the farmers. yy Created several digital media platforms to establish real-time linkages between scientists and farmers. The digital linkages strengthened during the year are briefly presented below: 29 DARE–ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2021-22   Developed ‘Matsya Setu App’ for teaching and demonstrating freshwater fish culture technologies.

With an array of agricultural technologies coming from 100 odd research institutions covering the entire supply chain in agriculture is the key driver for ICAR/ AgIn in start-up support. The fact is that ICAR/AgIn has created more than 800 successful start-ups through proven technology transfers in the last few years. In these endeavours, the initiative taken during the year are briefly described as follows: yy Established 50 Agri Business Incubators (ABIs) centres by Council that have incubated about 361 entrepreneurs, out of those 193 entrepreneurs/ startups initiated their own business during 2021-22. yy Conducted 127 Entrepreneurship Development Program (EDPs) to encourage the potential entrepreneurs. yy Protected innovative technologies through granting i) 52 patents of 27 ICAR Institutes, ii) registration certificates (through PPV&FRA) to 58 plant varieties. yy Filed 70 new plant varieties applications, 16 design applications and 22 trademarks; and registered 50 copyrights.
