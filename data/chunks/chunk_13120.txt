  Larval rearing is carried out in 2-5 tonne capacity tanks at stocking density of 5-10 nos/litre with mild aeration. Green water culture technique is undertaken.  Newly hatched larvae fed on enriched rotifer. Inert feed is started from 15th day and switched entirely to artificial feed from 20 days dph. Size grading is done every third day to avoid/ reduce cannibalism. The metamorphosis of the larvae takes 18-21days.  The breeding technology is mainly confined to the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. Compiled by: Dr A.K.

It forms an important candidate for cage aquaculture.  Fishes weighing about 1.0-1.5 kg are either wild caught or selected from grow-out cages and stocked in indoor flow through or re-circulation systems for raising gravid brooders.  Four sets of brooders (each set of 1 female and 2 males) are transferred to an FRP tank of 10 tonne capacity with photoperiod of 15L h at 2000 Lux and temperature of 27-32°C for final oocyte maturation.  Females with intra-ovarian egg diameter above 450 µm and milt oozing males are induced to spawn using HCG @ 350 IU/kg body weight for both the sexes. Alternatively, GnRH can be used at a dosage of 150 µg/kg body weight.  Spawning occurs within 36-40 h of induction. Hatching takes place between 18 to 22 h. Single female fish lay 50,000 to 250,000 eggs with fertilization rates of 75-90%.  The floating fertilized eggs are collected using a 500 µm mesh-size net and stocked in a 2 tonne FRP tank for hatching. The freshly spawned eggs measure 900-1000 µm.  Tanks of 5 tonne capacity are ideal for larviculture with maximum stocking density of 10-15 nos./litre. Green water technique is followed during the larviculture.  Brachionus and Artemia nauplii are used as live feeds. The black colour larvae metamorphose to silvery-white ones in 18-21 days.  The breeding technology is mainly confined to the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. Compiled by: Dr A.K.

Adult males and females weighing 2.5-3.0 kg are raised in Re-circulating Aquaculture System (RAS) @ 1 kg/m3 and fed with vitamin-mineral mixed squid and clam meat twice a day.
