 Phenotypic response to Al was measured on the bases of root re-growth (RRG), fluorescent signals and Al contents in hydroponic assay. Two major QTLs were identified using 7 trait linked markers, one each for fluorescent signals and RRG mapped on linkage group (LG) 1 under Al stress condition in F2 mapping population of cross BM 4 × L 4602. One major QTL (qAlt_fs) was localised in between PLC_88 and PBA_LC_373, covering 25.9 cM with adjacent marker PLC_88 at a distance of 0.4 cM. Another major QTL (qAlt_rrg) for RRG was in the marker interval of PBA_LC_1247    CROP IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2018–19 55 hypocotyl transcriptome analyses also report, for the first time, presence of a bacterial beta-galactosidase in plant kingdom and confirm its expression in both the WT and the mutant. Domain analysis and phylogenetic relationship studies showed that this bacterial beta-galactosidase is ubiquitous in plant kingdom and was acquired in higher plants from bacteria through algae and lower plants, not by horizontal gene transfer. More interestingly, this gene was not transferred to the animal kingdom. It shares considerable sequence similarity with E. coli BGAL with five BGAL-specific conserved domains and conserved active sites. On the other hand, an animal-kingdom specific BGAL is also conserved in the plant kingdom and is expressed in jute. Based on the domain architecture of BGAL proteins, a domain-centric evolution of BGALs is established, which shows evolutionary pathway of five classes of beta galactosidases, some of which have originated through domain integration and gene duplication. Seed production and seed technology research Breeder seed production: During 2017–18, total breeder seed production in field crops was 1,16,999 q against the indent of 98,048.4 q. The major share in total breeder seed production belongs to cereal crops, i.e. 60,230.7 q against indent of 42,761.6 q. Under pulse crops a total of 26,011.1 q breeder seed was produced against the indent of 20,054.9 q. In oilseeds, total breeder seed production was 29,302.5 q against the indent of 34,003.2 q. Breeder seed produced in case of fiber crops was 162.7 q against the indent of 110.4 q and in forage crops 1,292.2 q was produced against the indent of 1,118.3 q. Quality seed production: During the year 2017– 18, total production of quality seed including all classes was 5,97,992 q against the target of 3,66,059 q. Production comprises 1,37,605 q of foundation seed, 3,14,216 q of certified seeds, 96,443 q of truthfully labelled seed and 49,728 q of planting material of field crops. In addition, 202 lakh planting material and 1.3 lakh tissue culture plantlets were also produced against the targets of 172 lakh and 1.1 lakh, respectively. HORTICULTURE Central sub-committee on crop standards, notification and release identified 86 varieties in horticultural crops.
