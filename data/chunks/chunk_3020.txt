 Application of water through drip significantly increased the yield and quality parameters up to 60% daily evaporation replenishment at Bawal while at Anantpur, plants irrigated with drip and mulch with irrigation schedule at IW/CPE ratio of 0.8 in pomegranate fruit crops. At Faizabad in aonla drip irrigation with 0.60 IW/CPE at 3rd day irrigation was found most effective. Nutrition Management 1. 1 to 3 leaves can be used for N, P and K estimation and 3rd leaf from top can be used for micronutrient analysis for custard apple (Anantapur) www.icar.org.in 43 2002‐2007 2. Under Bangalore condition, a fertilizer dose of 500 g N, 250 g P2O5 and 250 g K2O per plant per year in two splits during May and another post monsoon along with 3‐4 basket of FYM and 1 kg neem cake for each plant of pomegranate is recommended. 3. In aonla fertilizer dose with combination of 100 g N, 50 g P2O5, 50g K2O per plant per year (1000 g N, 500g P2O5 and 500 g K2O of 10 year old plant) is recommended for commercial cultivation in UP. 4. In fertilizer dose with combination of 100 g N, 50 g P2O5, 50 g K2O per plant per year (800 g N, 400 g P2O5 and 400 g K2O of 8 year old plant) is recommended for commercial cultivation of bael in UP. (Faizabad) Flowering, Fruit Development and Ripening 1. NDUAT (Faizabad) has reported the phenomenon of self‐incompatibility in most of the commercial varieties of aonla and need of proportionate planting of pollinizer varieties. NA‐6 was found to be the best pollinizer for NA‐7. 2. At Bangalore, hand pollination with Squamosa (Custard apple) pollen is recommended to achieve not only higher productivity, but also large sized symmetrical Arka Sahan fruits. 3. Pre‐harvest application of ethrel @ 100 ppm at colour break stage was found to improve fruit weight and quality in date palm (RAU ‐ Bikaner). Removal of 1/3rd strands from the centre of the bunch at the time of pollination induced early maturity and improved quality of dates. Spray of ethrel (1500 ppm) at colour break stage gave uniform ripening and higher TSS in doka and dang fruits of date palm (PAU ‐ Abohar,). Application of 1000‐ppm ethepon at colour turning stage induced early ripening by one week in Halawy variety of date palm. 4. Application of 750 ppm of ethephon at colour turning stage induced early ripening in ber (NDUAT ‐ Faizabad). In pomegranate, 50 fruits / tree was found to be optimum for highest return per tree (MPKV ‐ Rahuri). Kaolin (5.0 ‐ 7.5%) and liquid paraffin (1%) have been found to improve yield and check fruit cracking in pomegranate and ber. Pest and Disease Management 1. Fig rust can be controlled by 3‐4 sprays of 0.2 per cent chlorothalonil or copper oxychloride (0.40%) during the crop susceptibility period. 2. For the control of ber fruit fly carbaryl 50 WP 0.1% has been found to be the best pesticide. Three to four sprays at 0.01% starting from peanut stage till maturity can check the fruit fly incidence effectively. Fenthion 100 EC 0.
