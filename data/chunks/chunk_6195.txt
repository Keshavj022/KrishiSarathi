 Banerjee (1967) opined that ponds should have dissolved oxygen concentration above 5 ppm for average or good fish production. In the present investigation the treatments of both indoor and outdoor experiments had average dissolved oxygen concentration above 5 mg/litre (Tables 5a and 5b). The dissolved oxygen content varied from 6.07 ± 2.19 to 9.87 ± 0.92 in all of the treatments in indoor experiment, but in outdoor experiment the dissolved oxygen values varied from 5.2 ± 1.06 to 13.26 ± 1.10 mg/litre during the study period. In both the experiments, the dissolved oxygen levels were slightly low during summer due to the low solubility of oxygen at higher temperature. No significant impact of the juice on the dissolved oxygen concentration could be observed. During indoor study the turbidity of water decreased from D0 to D2g in all the treatments. This might be due to settling of suspended particles in the water as the experiment proceeded (Table 6). The turbidity values varied from 6.53 ± 0.17 to 17.57 ± 3.92 NTU in control (T0). The turbidity value varied from 3.7 ± 0.17 to 25.53 ± Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Table 4a.

Turbidity (mean ± S.D. in NTU) during indoor experiment 0.23 NTU in lime treatment (T4 and different treatments of banana juice (T1, T2, T3 Among treatments, at the end of the experiment, the turbidity was the lowest in T3 followed by T1, T2 , T4 and T0. Thus juice of banana pseudostem is most effective in reducing the turbidity of water. This shows that this juice has coagulating effect in water, which helped in lowering of turbidity. The formation of flocculates by the juice might be responsible in separation of suspended and colloidal particles from the water through coagulation or precipitation. Calcium content Calcium normally occurs in combination with carbonates, and their formation depends upon the loss of carbon dioxide from the carbon dioxide- carbonate system, which is related to temperature, pH, partial pressure across the water surface and the nature of other substance present in water. Calcium is considered one of the essential nutrients present in lime. Calcium deficiency is often associated with acidity. In the present study (Tables 7a and 7b) calcium content varied from 22.70 ± 4.44 to 31.78 ± 0.92 mg/litre in control (T0) in outdoor experiment. In lime treatment (T4) and banana pseudostem-juice treatments (T1 to T3), the calcium contents were higher than in the control (T0) which varied from 21.75 ± 5.60 to 44.24 ± 2.42 mg/litre. In case of indoor experiment the calcium value in T0 fluctuated between 30.10 ± 3.23 and 45.90 ± 10.
