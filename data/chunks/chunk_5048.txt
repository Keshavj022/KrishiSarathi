Experiment Field experiment was conducted with 3 treatments (i) Cynodon dactylon extract spray, (ii) Endosulfan 35EC 0.07% spray, and (iii) untreated check. Tomato (variety PKM- 1) was raised in 45m2 plots in 7 replications. Incidence of pest and yield were recorded. Preparation of Cynodon decoction Fresh leaves of cynodon are sun dried and powdered. 2 kg, powder is mixed with 10 litres of water in a mud pot and is left for 24 hours. Filtrate obtained is diluted with equal quantity of water and sprayed at 15 days interval until harvest. Preparation method is depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 2. Fruit borer management in tomato using Cynodon dactylon extract RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Matrix ranking on the efficacy of the practice vis-Ã -vis other alternative was done through unstructured interview using PRA methods. The results obtained are depicted in Fig.2 and 3. Experiment Observation on Helicoverpa armigera was recorded with respect to the treatments. The results showed that the spraying of Endosulfan at 0.07% is highly effective against fruit borer. The results obtained on the three treatments are chalked out in the Table 1.
