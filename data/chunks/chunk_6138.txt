 plantation on high slope with terraced land, T2 the plantation on moderate slope with terraced land, T3 the plantation on high slope on non- terraced land; and T4 the plantation on moderate slope with non terraced land. The transects were laid out at different slopes. The analysis of variance indicated the significant effect of slope on the spread and height of apple trees. It can be inferred that at high slopes the farmer's intervention of developing small terraces is useful in getting better performance. The plant height as well as the spread of the apple trees was generally more in the terraced and high slopes, followed by the terracing at the moderate slope. In addition, the contouring at moderate slopes also proved beneficial, but not at higher slopes. It happened so probably because the construction of small terraces provided a medium to hold the tree roots at the initial stage, Table 3.

Table 3 shows that the mean spread was 5feet, which can be classified as the satisfactory growth. The maximum value of the spread of the plants was 14feet, with an exception to very thin growth of plants. The data were analysed using the two sets of degrees of slopes as treatment, i.e., very high (>50 degrees) and moderate (30-40 degrees), along with the combination of the terraced and non-terraced areas in the SALT area. T1 represents the which gave boost in the establishment of plants. The pH did not differ in the different systems, because the studied site is being treated by the farmer under the SALT for the last 5 years only. However, organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, bulk density and porosity decreased with increase in the soil depth. The soil-moisture retention was more in the top layer of the soil, which supplemented the adoption concept of the SALT farmers of the area. There was reduction in the species diversity SOIL.
