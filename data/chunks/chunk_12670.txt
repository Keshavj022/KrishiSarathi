 The analysis of data indicated that annual compound growth rate is highest in livestock sector (18%), followed by fisheries (11%), crop sector (4.7%) and forestry sector (3.8%). There exists a tremendous scope not only to maintain this rate of growth but also to raise it further using an inclusive approach of increasing crop and livestock productivity through proper technological interventions, stabilizing prices of local commodities through appropriate marketing policies in case of extra production, reducing cost of production, diversifying farming and cropping system, promoting secondary agriculture and value addition, and augmenting income from other sources. Multi-pronged strategies and actions are needed to enhance income of farmers’ which are discussed in the report.   Increasing water productivity and cropping intensity through efficient watermanagement: Rajasthan has access to 1% of water resources in spite of having 10% geographical area of the country. Despite this, micro-irrigation technology is being used only in 10% of irrigated area which has to be substantially increased for increasecropping intensity in the state using same amount of water. It has been demonstrated that drip irrigation saves water up to 80%. The model of Narmada canal, that makes water to be essentially used only through pressurized irrigation, needs to be replicated in canal command area of IGNP. Low-water requirement crops like wheat, chickpea and mustard instead of water guzzlers like groundnut, castor, and rice in the irrigated areas needs to be promoted by legislation. In-situ and ex-situ water harvesting would also play an important role in increasing cropping intensity. Utilization of waste water for irrigation purposes has a great potential especially in peri-urban areas.   Livestock-based integrated farming system (IFS) approach: Cultivation of crops only ina typical rainfed farming situation was found to give, on an average, a net return of Rs.] 16,000/ha, while average net return from an integrated farming system was Rs.35,000/ha. In addition, IFS approach offers round-the-year employment. Several IFS models have been suggested having an appropriate combination of horticulture, grasses, livestock, boundary plantation and crops for various agro-climatic zones of the state. Developing entrepreneurship among farmers through FPOs, SHGs etc. is very important to maximize profit from IFS   Improving livestock productivity: There is reported 30-40% shortage of dry stover for livestock and therefore augmenting fodder supply through rejuvenation of degraded grasslands become critically important. Use of region-specific multi-nutrient mixture, feed blocks or pellets can further help in improving the livestock productivity. Improvement of local breeds of livestock needs special emphasis and establishment of Artificial Insemination centers at block level is essential to achieve it.
