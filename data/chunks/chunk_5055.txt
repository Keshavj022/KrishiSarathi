 METHODOLOGY Location The efficacy of kochila-mixed cowdung compost for controlling fruit and shoot borer was evaluated by participatory rural appraisal (PRA), field survey and experimental methods. These were conducted at village Badakodanda, Bhanjanagar, Dist. Ganjam (Orissa). Fruit and shoot borer is the major insect in brinjal. Borer causes harm to shoot as well as to fruits, reducing the market value of brinjal. Fig. 1. Kochila seeds  HORTICULTURAL CROPS Table 1.

Healthy crop of brinjal after the treatment The PRA was conducted to determine the efficacy of kochila -mixed cowdung compost as compared to plant protection method by use of pesticide. The survey was done on 10 farmers of village Badakodanda. The following parameters were taken for study, i.e. growth of plant, fruit borer incidence, fruit setting, fruit size, number of fruits/plant, fruit yield/plant and taste of healthy fruits. Fig. 3. Treatments under experimentation on use of kochila mixed with compost (left) and use of pesticide (right) for control of fruit and shoot borer in brinjal Experiment The experiment was conducted at two sites at (i) Badakodanda village, and (ii) KVK, Bhanjanagar, with three treatments: (i) kochila mixed cowdung compost applied @ 5 g/plant at planting and @ 10 g/plant after 45 days of transplanting (ITK method), (ii) chemical pesticide: granular pesticide at planting @ 10 kg ai/ha, monocrotophos 15 days after transplanting, endosulfan 15 days after transplanting, Nukil 60 days after transplanting and Sevin- 75 days after transplanting, and (iii) without any treatment control.
