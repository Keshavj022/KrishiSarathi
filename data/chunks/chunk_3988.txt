 The bud sticks should have plumpy, slightly swollen and green buds. The rootstocks are prepared by removing all the side shoots and heading back at the height of 25-30 cm from the base. The method of budding during July to September gives about 60% success. In this method, a vertical incision is given in the bark of the rootstock to a length of 2-3 cm Table 1.

The bark is slightly loosened from the sides with the help of budding knife and a piece of scion having plumpy bud is inserted into the loosened bark of the rootstock. It is then tied with a polythene wrap. Proper aftercare regarding timely watering, removal of side shoots, weeding etc. are taken. The bud sprouting start in about 20-25 days after budding and the budded plants are ready for out planting in the field after 40-50 days of budding (Fig. 1). The out planting in the field may be done during September October before the advent of low temperature. Orchard establishment To development true-to type plantation of khejri variety, Thar Shobha vegetative propagations technique is necessary either budding on nursery raised root stocks or in situ budding in field established rootstocks. The bud grafted plants have vigorous growth, thornless, precocious flowering, high pod yield and bio-mass from 3-4 years of establishment. For easy germination and healthy growth of seedlings, prior to sowing, seeds should be soaked in water for 4-6 hours and also treated with fungicide. For field planting, 9-10 months old seedlings should be used and it should be started with the on-set of monsoon rains from July-September which gives 80-90% establishment. Training and pruning Training and pruning are essential practices for plant structure, canopy management and harvest of crop produce khejri.
