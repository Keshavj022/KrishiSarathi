 Sensor Working principle Applications Resistance block sensors Resistance block soil moisture sensor is based on the fact that water is a good conductor of electricity, while dry soil is a poor conductor Soil science research, horticulture, and landscaping Neutron probe (nuclear) sensors Neutron probe sensor involves the interaction of fast neutrons with hydrogen atoms in the soil Precision irrigation, estimate water inﬁltration rates, and assess groundwater recharge Dielectric permittivity sensors A dielectric permittivity sensor is based on the dielectric properties of the soil, which is the ability of a material to store electrical charges in an electric ﬁeld. When a dielectric material, such as soil, is placed between two conductive plates (electrodes), it forms a capacitor. The amount of charge the capacitor can store is determined by the dielectric permittivity of the material, which, in turn, depends on the soil’s moisture content Maintaining optimal soil moisture levels, to study soil water dynamics 6 Journal of Sensors TABLE 5: Crop health sensor types used in smart framing.
