 Shelf pollination is difficult as the flowers show pin type heterostyly where thick-erect long style protrudes out of the floral parts and anther bearing filaments are short. Best pollination time is from dawn to dusk which is performed manually by touching the separated filaments on the receptive stigma base or by collecting the pollen grains on butter paper and applying those pollen grains on the stigma base with a fine brush.

Shri Pavankumar Basappa Rangatti, 21 years of age, is a young graduate hailing from Ratnapur village, Tikota Taluk, Vijayapur district of Karnataka.

Browsing through the newspapers, he read about the trainings being conducted by Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Vijayapura-I on organic farming, especially meant for individuals aged below 35 years; and he attended one such training. Subsequently, he adopted dragon fruit cultivation in his dry land area, under the technical guidance of KVK, Vijayapura-I. Earlier his father was growing grape, which was a costly affair. Looking into the expenses on cultivation of grapes, his father too supported him in his new venture. He brought 4,000 saplings of both white and red varieties of dragon fruit from Maharashtra, and took the risk of planting them in his 2 acres of land. He harvested the fruits after one and half years. He sells the fruits at the rate of ` 150-180 per kg and sapling at the rate of ` 20 per sapling. In 18 months only, he earned ` 1.25 lakh by spending ` 3.00 lakh. Gradually, his profit increased to ` 3.80 lakh in second year, ` 6.00 lakh in third and ` 8.00 lakh in fourth year by selling the fruits.
