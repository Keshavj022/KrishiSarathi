 Nutrient management For rainfed (shallow to medium soil): Apply 40:20:00 kg of NPK per ha as basal dose. For rainfed (deep soil): Apply 60:30:00 kg of NPK per ha as basal. For irrigated conditions: Apply 80:40:40 kg of NPK per ha (N in two equal splits, 50% as basal and 50% at 30–35 days after sowing, full P and K at time of sowing is recommended) (Table 2). Table 2.

Insect-pest and disease management A few insect-pest and diseases attack on sorghum crop. These can be controlled by adopting cultural and chemical practices (Table 3). Inter-cultivation and weed control Inter-cultivation 2 or 3 times at 3, 5 and 7 weeks after sowing should be done to check the weed growth, which also helps to conserve soil moisture by providing CSV 26R CSV 18R CSV 29R Indian Farming 102 January 2023 top soil mulch. Weed control by application of atrazine @0.5 kg a.i/ha by spraying on the soil as pre-emergence application immediately within 48 hours after sowing is found effective. Water management Although sorghum is a drought tolerant crop, it responds well to irrigations and is well suited for limited irrigations. It is also known as water sipping crop as it uses water very efficiently. Water availability to plant largely depends on soil texture. To increase productivity, sorghum crops need between 425 and 610 mm of water. The mature sorghum plant roots can draw moisture from the soil up to a depth of 2 m, although yields are greatest when moisture is present in the top 76 cm of the soil. It can also be grown on residual soil moisture with limited irrigation facilities. Critical stages for irrigation in sorghum The period of 40–85 days after sowing during flowering and grain formation stages is very sensitive to moisture stress. The critical growth stages of sorghum in relation to water requirement are mentioned in Table 4. In case, water is available for providing irrigation at all four stages, it would be advantageous. Under irrigated conditions in medium–deep to deep soils, three irrigations first at germination, second at panicle initiation and third at grain filling stage are desirable. Optimum irrigation schedule consists of five irrigations each at 35, 55, 75, 85 and 105 days after sowing which coincides with physiological stages of panicle, primordial initiation, boot leaf, flowering, milky and dough stages, respectively.
