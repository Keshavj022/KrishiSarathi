 In S 2 generation the average body weight at 4 and 6 weeks of age declined by 35 g and 140 g, respectively, over earlier generation, which was desirable for making the bird acceptable for rural situation shank length an important criterion in selection, to overcome the predator problem in free-range system of rearing. Chicks from various colour combinations were selected and saved to achieve desired pattern of plumage colours in the terminal cross. Final selection at 6 weeks of age was done based on humoral response to SRBC and develop birds, which will respond well to initial vaccination. The average intensity of selection for shank length and SRBC titers was 0.46σ and 0.32σ. The heritability for 4 and 6 weeks body weight was moderate in magnitude and low for shank length. Tinted egg layer for backyard poultry farming: A pedigreed line of Dehlam red was utilized for generating the colour terminal cross for rural poultry production. In S 0 generation the age at sexual maturity, body weight at 20 and 40 weeks of age, egg weight at 24, 28 and 40 weeks of age and egg number up to 40 weeks of age were 169.4 days, 1,425 g, 1,789 g, 45.68 g, 51.24 g, 54.57 g and 69.81 eggs, respectively. Development of naked neck (Na) and dwarf genelines (dw) for tropical adaptation: The juvenile body weight of naked neck gene line for 4- and 6-week body weights were 588 g and 1,273 g in males, and 518 g and 1,031 g in females respectively. The 6-week body weight showed an improvement of 230 g compared to earlier generation. The introgression of available naked neck gene into layer background was attempted (IWH line) and the advantages of adaptability and egg weight were evaluated against the pure line White Leghorn. They matured at 146 days of age, produced 109 eggs which weighed 45.5 g, 49.7 g and 53.5 g at 24, 28 and 40 weeks of age, respectively. These birds were heavier by 400 g over pure Leghorn and produced eggs that weighed 2–6 g more than pureline. The first generation of backcross progenies was produced and its performance is being recorded. The body weight of dwarf gene line at 4 and 6 weeks was 449 g and 849 g for the combined sexes, respectively. The intensity of selection was only 0.23σ and 0.15σ correspondingly for males and females. The average age at sexual maturity was 154.8 days and the egg number up to 40 weeks of age was 66.39 eggs with egg weight of 51.6 g and 58.2 g at 32 and 40 weeks of age. Improvement of colour broiler population: The colour male line is an open nucleus population and has completed two generations of random mating. The average intensity of selection for body weight at 5 weeks of age for the males, females and for combined sex was 0.92 σ, 0.56 σ, and 0.61 σ, respectively. At 16 weeks of age, 505 females and 125 males were saved for recording of production and other body weight traits after screening for skeletal and other deformities.
