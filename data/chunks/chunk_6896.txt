 It will provide advanced wheat breeding lines with alternative dwarfing genes and better seedling establishment traits suitable for conservation agriculture. Identifying the genomic regions and genes for drought and heat tolerance in groundnut: To identify the genomic regions for drought and heat tolerance in groundnut, eight parents and 500 lines of the MAGIC population, 432 RILs of TMV2 × TMV2-NLM and 250 RILs of JL 24 × 55-437 were subjected for DNA sequencing. The linkage map constructed with 700 SNP markers could identify major main effect QTLs for pod yield with the highest PVE of 10.5%. Nine QTLs with the highest PVE of 18.4% were identified for Shoot Dry Weight (SDW). A few of them were also involved in epistatic interactions, and formed multiple QTL mapping models. Five major QTLs for SDW were stable over both the locations. Candidate genes with SNPs and AhMITE1 insertion were identified for the major QTL regions. Map was also constructed using 478 SNPs for the RIL population of JL 24 × 55-437. Forty-five major main effect QTLs were identified for 21 traits. Three QTL clusters (Cluster-1-Ah03, Cluster-2-Ah12, and Cluster- 3-Ah20) harboured more than half of the major QTLs for target traits, explaining as high as 38.6%, 44.6%, and 49.5% of PVE, respectively. Candidate genes encoding heat shock protein, heat shock transcription factors, and flowering regulation genes were identified at QTL clusters. Population structure analysis identified four subgroups. Seven significant marker-trait associations for five traits were identified in 374 kb (carrying 348 genes) genomic region on chromosome Ah18. Development of sustainable management tools for fall armyworm in maize: The maize genotypes, viz. CML 44 BBB (3.0), DML 163-1 (3.5), IML 16- 248 (4.0) were found promising based on leaf damage rating (1-9) scale for foliar resistance to fall armyworm (FAW) (Spodoptera frugiperda) artificial infestation. The expression study of lipoxygenase and BXs pathway genes and correlation analysis of jasmonate and BXs metabolites indicated that induction of toxic BXs accumulation in resistant genotypes depends on JA signalling pathway. Higher content of threonine (Thr) and arginine (Arg) was found in BML 6 (susceptible line) and lower in resistant lines (DMRE 63, CML 71). Five geographical populations of FAW were assessed for molecular diversity using the Tpi marker to resolve the ambiguity in mtCOI-based strain identification. All were identified as corn strains based on nucleotide variations at positions 168, 180, and 183 of the Tpi exon, where a few individuals also had Corn-Rice inter-strain signatures at certain positions. Also, more than 90% of the FAW population in India is corn strain according to sequenced data and NCBI data.
