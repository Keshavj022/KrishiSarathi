 Computing a ration as per the requirement of an animal A suitable combination of locally available roughages and concentrates that meet the total requirements of the given animal can be selected from the available feeds and fodders from the locally available feedstuffs. From the various feedstuffs given the ration of a cow can be approximately worked out. Thumb rule of feeding cattle Knowledge of feeding standards and information on body weights of animals is required for computation of ration for dairy cattle by the conventional method. Many calculations are made before the quantity of each feed ingredient required is determined. In practice, however, this may prove cumbersome and impracticable. Keeping this in view the routine feeding of cattle can be simplified by following a thumb rule of feeding which is based on a sound practical experience rather than the scientific basis as in case of conventional method. The feeding of mainly the straws and concentrates forms the basis of feeding by thumb rule method as these are the principle feed ingredients for feeding of cattle in most parts of India and the availability of green fodders is limited. The amounts of concentrate mixture and the straws that will provide optimum daily requirement for cattle by thumb rule are given here.

Formulation of concentrate mixture The concentrate should be formulated as per BIS type II for a production level of up to 20 kg milk per day. It should be preferably BIS type I if production level of the cow is as high as 40 kg / day. Along with the concentrate mixture the ration shall include dry fodders such as wheat straw, paddy straw. The green fodder shall include both leguminous and non-leguminous season fodders. The composition of an ideal concentrate mixture for making 1 q of concentrate mixture should be as under. Concentrate ingredient Parts (in kg) Maize grains 33 Groundnut cake (expeller) 21 Mustard cake (expeller) 12 Wheat bran 20 Deoiled rice polish 11 Mineral mixture 2 Common salt 1 For lactating cows provide 400 g concentrate mixture for every one kg milk produced to a cow along with 1.5 additional concentrate mixture for meeting the requirements of maintenance.
