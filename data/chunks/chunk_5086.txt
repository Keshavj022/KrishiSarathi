 Number of fruits/branch at fruit set stage The maximum number of fruit set/branch at fruit set stage (Table 3) occurred during autumn bending of branch (65.0) than summer bending (43.0). The summer bending of branches produced maximum number of new shootlets/branch but fruit set was reduced due to excessive fruit drop during summer season. Production of reproductive shoots was also reduced during summer months, which caused lesser fruit set/branch. Number of fruit per shootlet Number of fruits per shootlet at initial stage was also higher during autumn bending of branches than during summer bending. Other treatments also showed similar trend in results in this regard. At present the fruits of summer bending of branches are in marble stage of growth. Therefore rest of the observations like number of fruits retained up to harvest/branch, number of fruit/plant at harvest and average fruit weight (g/fruit) were incorporated, for which the finding of autumn bending branch in year 2002 is given. Number of furits retained up to harvest per branch Maximum number of fruits retained up to harvest per branch was with autumn bending of branch (22.6). Number of fruits per plant at harvest Highest number of fruits per plant at harvest was recorded in bending of branch in autumn (258.0) whereas T2 and T3 produced 117.0 and 22.0 fruits/plant, respectively. Average fruit weight (g/fruit) In spite of having maximum number of fruits/plant, T1 (bending of branches during autumn) produced highest fruit weight (187.0 g/fruit). Khaja Days required to emerge new shoot The data presented in Table 4 show that summer bending of branch (T1) caused early emergence of new shootlet (11.5 days) as compared to autumn bending of branch (26.3 days). Earliness in new shoot emergence during summer bending was also recorded in T2, i.e. complete removal of leaves from the shoot and decapitation. The control plants did not have new shoots, as the plants were in bearing stage (at pre-harvest stage) at the time of bending in summer. Number of new shootlets per branch Production of new shootlets/branch was also increased in summer bending of branch (19.0) as compared to autumn bending (10.8). In other treatments summer season produced more  HORTICULTURAL CROPS Table 4. Morphological changes and fruit yield of guava (cv.
