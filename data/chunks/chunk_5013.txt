 T 1:  PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT control, T 2: soil treatment with folidol dust @ 25 kg/ha (15 days before transplant of sugarcane); T3: use of horse droppings @ 100 kg/ha; and T 4: sugarcane tip dipped in kerosene oil. The plot size was 500 m 2 for each treatment. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Data on the field study conducted through PRA have been presented in Table 1. The results show that the reported ITK, i.e., application of horse droppings, was rated superior to both the chemical control measure and use of kerosene oil in all respects except availability, as the population of horses nowadays has decreased. This ITK is an age-old practice, regarding which a majority of the respondents (72%) opined that the ITK was effective up to 80%. Experiment The results given in Table 2 indicate that Table 2.

Maximum damage (26.41%) was recorded in control plots. Significantly higher percentage (8.45%) in mortality of plants was recorded in kerosene oil treatment due to its toxic effect, which hampered the germination of sugarcane. Low incidence (4.57%) of termite was recorded in horse droppings at 45 days after planting which was at par (4.97%) in chemical insecticide treatments. Incidence of termite was 12.68% in kerosene oil- treated plots, which was maximum (37.29%) in the control. At 45 days after planting low percentage of mortality was recorded in all the treatments due to other factors. CONCLUSION The ITK (application of horse droppings) was found to be effective as that of use of folidol for controlling termite in sugarcane field. FARM IMPLEMENTS Code : 2039 Title of the ITK : Pingali dhanti for intercultural operation in tomato. Description of the ITK : Bullock drawn pingali dhanti can be effectively used for weed control in tomato both during kharif and rabi instead of hand weeding. It can cover an area of one acre per day with a cost of operation of Rs 150/ha. By adopting this, clean weeding is achieved. It costs about Rs 100. Name and address of the discloser : Shri B.
