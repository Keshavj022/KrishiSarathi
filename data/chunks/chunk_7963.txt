36 days). The overall least squares means of 300 days milk yield, total milk yield, peak yield and lactation length were 3,312.25 kg, 3,321.74 kg, 15.11 kg and 322.02 days, respectively. The least squares means of service period, dry period and calving interval were 164.59, 119.76 and 440.30 days, respectively. Genetic evaluation of ninth set of bulls, carried out based on the first lactation records of the progeny, had 0.58% genetic superiority over the population mean. Improvement of indigenous cattle breeds through selection: This project was conceptualized for the genetic improvement of some important native cattle breeds, viz. Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal in their home tracts. Bulls of Gir (24), Kankrej (26) and Sahiwal (26) were inducted in three different sets for progeny testing. The total number of inseminations carried out in Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal units were 2,510, 2,573 and 1,195 with the conception percentages of 48.44, 47.76 and 34.72, respectively. Since inception of the project (year 2010), 4,623 Gir, 1,537 Kankrej and 734 Sahiwal daughters were born. The average age at first calving in Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal were 1343.5, 1273.44 and 1189.55 days respectively. The average first lactation 305 days or less milk yield, first lactation length and first peak yield were 2,392.1 kg, 499.1 days and 13.7 kg in Gir and 2,295.27 kg, 312.13 days and 10.53 kg in Kankrej cattle. In Sahiwal the average first lactation 305-day milk yield and total first lactation milk yield were 1,850.70 and 2,001.11 kg, respectively. Progeny testing: The project envisages to progeny test Frieswal (HFÃ—Sahiwal) bulls under field conditions at four different agro-climatic locations in India having larger concentration of HF cross cows. A total of 284, 268, 260 and 70 bulls have so far been introduced in GADVASU, Ludhiana; KVASU, Thrissur; BAIF, Uruli-Kanchan; and GBPUAT, Pantnagar; respectively. During the year, a total of 5718, 4755, 9125 and 4761 AIs were carried out in GADVASU Ludhiana; KVASU, Thrissur; BAIF, Uruli- Kanchan; and GBPUA&T, Pantnagar with the conception percentages of 46.4, 42.7, 44.5 and 53.5, respectively. The number of daughters completed their first lactation in GADVASU, Ludhiana; KVASU, Thrissur; BAIF, Uruli-Kanchan; and GBPUA&T, Pantnagar were 3,549, 1,658, 3,366 and 369, respectively. The average 305-days milk yield of daughters ranged from 1,958 to 2,835 kg at KVASU, Thrissur; 2,698 to 3,841 kg at GADVASU, Ludhiana; 2,930 to 3,117 kg at BAIF, Uruli-Kanchan; and 2,459 to 3,181 kg at GBPUAT, Pantnagar in different sets. In all the four centres, the first lactation milk production showed an increasing trend over the years while the age at first calving has decreased. The average breeding values of bulls of seventh set at KVASU, Thrissur; GADVASU, Ludhiana; and BAIF, Uruli-Kanchan were 2,697.8, 3,578.95 and 3,159.13 kg, respectively, with an overall average of 3,144.37 kg.
