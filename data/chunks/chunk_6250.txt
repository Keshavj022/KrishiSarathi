There was significant increase in the average weight of female genital organs of mice that received pigeon waste (Table 7, Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Comparative growth and development of female genital organs at GBPUAT CONCLUSION The findings of IVRI, Izatnagar (during 2002- 2004) and GBPUAT, Pantnagar (during 2004) were almost similar and pigeon waste was found useful in bringing to anoestrus heifers to normal cyclicity and conception. The conception rate using this ITK was similar to that of standard hormonal treatment. However, the cost of treatment using ITK was much cheaper than that of standard veterinary treatment. Its mineral composition is almost similar to the commercially available mineral supplements. Experimental studies have suggested that ITK has beneficial effect on the development of reproductive organs and attaining puberty age early in the mice. â–¡ Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Code Title of the ITK Description of the ITK Name and address of the discloser Location of use of the ITK Experimenters Fig. 1. Paste of geru, snail shell, alua (Aloe vera) and sahjan gum : 1272 Treatment of swelling of shoulders in bullocks or bulls : When shoulders are swollen, bullocks are unable to do work. A mixture of geru (30 g) and snail shell or sipi (50 g) is boiled in castor oil. Alua (20 g) and kudru or sahjan gum (50 g) are mixed to it. This paste under warm condition is applied on the affected swollen neck of the animal. This is practised by the villagers of Nayabas Kutubpur in Bulandshahr district of Uttar Pradesh. : Shri Prem Pal Singh Arya, C/o Shri Daal Chand, House No. 38, Purva Ahiram Indra chowk, Meerut (Uttar Pradesh) : This condition is generally seen in draught animals. The bullocks are generally affected and the condition is known as yoke gall. The cases are generally seen in areas where bullock carts are used for transportation of goods. Continuous chronic irritation results in painful swelling and wounds at shoulder. As shown in Fig. 1, inappropriate size of animals in a pair used for draught or agricultural operations also leads to this disease.
