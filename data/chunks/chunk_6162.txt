Qulk matrix scoring method was applied to know the perceptions of the respondents. Experiment Field experiments for validation of the ITK were conducted during 2002-2003, 2003-2004 and 2004 in the months of October to April, August to February and April to December, respectively in three different growing seasons. The experiment was designed in Randomised Block Design (RBD) with 20 replications using three treatments, viz., T1 control, T2, spray of tobacco soaked water (1 : 10) and T3, recom- mended practice (spray of endosulphan @ 1.0 litre/ha) as chemical insecticide. Each treatment covered an area of 1000 m2. During 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 the brinjal variety—Pusa Purple Long was used whereas during 2004 variety— Mukta Keshi was used for experimentation. Seedlings of brinjal were raised in nursery bed by sowing seed @ 600 g/ha during all the 3 years of experimentation. The seed bed was prepared 10' long, 4' wide and 6" raised. Between 2 seed beds two feet wide path was provided for care and management of the nursery plants. About 25 days old seedlings were planted in the 1 st week of November 2002, July 2003 and May 2004 at the spacing of 60 cm row to row and 45 cm plant Contents HORTICULTURAL CROPS to plant. The crop was fertilized with 85 : 50 : 30 kg NPK/ha. Tobacco stalk @ 60 kg/ha alongwith 40 g/ha detergent powder was used in 600 litre water. Similarly, endosulphan @ 1.0 litre/ha was also sprayed at the same intervals. The spraying was started after 5-6 weeks of transplanting at an interval of 15 days. However, during 2004 control measures were applied at the intervals of 8-10 days, as the insect infestation was observed during peak of the rainy season. Altogether 5 sprays were done during 2002-03 and 2003-04 whereas 10-12 sprays were done during 2004. Observations recorded were number of infected shoot/m2, number of infected fruit/m2, yield and economics of cultivation and the data statistically analysed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field survey: The farmers were of opinion that tobacco stalk is easily available at cheaper rate in the market. It is eco-friendly and has no side effect either on soil or on human health. In most of the houses in villages people use tobacco as chewing purpose and waste product is utilized in controlling the insect pest in brinjal. Hence, no additional monetary involvement is there. That is why they practice this treatment. Data generated through Qulk have Table 1.
