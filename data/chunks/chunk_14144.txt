 PRGFEE shares risk with ﬁnancial institu- tions for energy efﬁciency projects, while VCFEE supports investments in emerging technologies and services. Both EEFP and FEEED can help DCs under the PAT program to secure ﬁnancing and foster innovation and job creation. Together, these policies establish a nationwide platform, reducing green project capital costs, linking global green ﬁnancing, and promoting innovation and job creation. ECBC is a set of guidelines introduced by BEE in 2007 and further amended in 2017 to promote energy efﬁciency and sustainable building practices16. It sets energy performance standards for new commercial buildings and major renova- tions, covering various aspects of building design, construc- tion, and operation, aiming to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions (Berardi, 2017). A study conducted in Bhubaneswar, Orissa, found that ECBC-compliant buildings were up to 24.7% more energy-efﬁcient than non-compliant ones (Sendrayaperumal et al., 2021), leading to signiﬁcant energy demand reductions and environmental beneﬁts while improving occupants’ quality of life (Chandel, Sharma, & Marwaha, 2016). Supply-side policies India’s DISCOMs faced accumulated losses of nearly D1,130 billion (»US$13.74 billion) by 2021, impacting the public through increased taxes as most are state-owned. To tackle this, GOI introduced the 2021 Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS), emphasising DISCOMs’ ﬁnancial restructur- ing and infrastructure enhancements like advanced metering, smart grids, and substation modernisation. The RDSS scheme has an outlay of D3 trillion (D3 lakh crore), with approximately D0.98 trillion (D98000 crore) consisting of government support between FY’2122 to FY’252617. The primary aim is to reduce Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses to 12%15% nationwide. Early results indicate AT&C losses fell to approximately 17% in FY 20212022 from 22.32% in FY 2020202118. Despite the substantial initial investment, RDSS promises long-term beneﬁts, including healthier ﬁnances, better integration of RE, increased cus- tomer satisfaction, reduced electricity costs, fuel savings, and lower emissions. GOI has also aimed to increase RE’s contribution to reduc- ing imported energy dependence and GHG emissions while enhancing energy security. In 2015, India set an ambitious target of achieving 175 GW of RE capacity by 2022 under the National Solar Mission and National Wind Mission, focusing on solar (100 GW), wind (60 GW), and other sources (15 GW)19. Various incentives and initiatives were introduced, but by 2022, India could achieve only 121 GW, falling short by approximately 30%20. Despite this, the government has set a new target to add 250 GW of RE capacity from 2023 to 202821, demonstrating its commitment to sustainable energy. Greater RE integration can reduce reliance on non- renewable resources, improve the balance of payments, and reduce long-term operational expenses.
