 Efficient moisture-harvesting genotypes: In the central zone, wheat WH147 gave RICE TRANSPLANTER A manual 4-row transplanter, which can be operated in irrigated and rainfed shallow lowlands, has been developed. This machine covers 0.2 ha/day, saving 60% on labour and 55% on cost as compared with rice transplanting done manually. Cost of transplanter is Rs 4,000 and operation cost is about Rs 600/ha. WHEATS IDENTIFIED Variety Production conditions and area of recommendation HUW 533 Timely sown, rainfed areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Orissa GW 322 Timely sown, irrigated areas of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, parts of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka HD 2781 Timely sown, rainfed areas of Maharashtra, Karnataka HW 2045 Late sown, irrigated areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Orissa ● ●● ●● Five CHA products have produced acceptable level of male sterility in wheat at the appropriate doses. ● In north-western plains zone, 2 hybrids of wheat HM 99168 and HM 9997 have exhibited more than 12% heterosis over the best check PBW 343. ● A marker-aided selection approach, utilizing PCR-based markers linked to quality traits and disease resistance genes in wheat, is being executed at the Directorate of Wheat Research. ● Diversification of rice-wheat system by berseem or oats for fodder once in 3 years reduced weed infestation.

Genotypes for terminal heat stress in the north-western plains zone: Late-sown crop is invariably exposed to terminal heat stress in the zone. A large number of genotypes were evaluated under rising ambient temperature as well as under continuous heat in plastic houses. HD 2428 was found susceptible to higher maximum temperature whereas NIAW 845, WH 730, CBW 12 were tolerant to terminal hot environment. Crop Production Various tillage options were evaluated and perfected in a farmers’ participatory approach in three villages around Karnal.
