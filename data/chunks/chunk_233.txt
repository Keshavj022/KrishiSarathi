 The area and production has been decreased dramatically around 40% and 13%, respectively, as compared to 2016-17. This crop is mainly cultivated in northern and central parts of the country. The major field pea growing states are Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Assam and Maharashtra. During recent past, several field pea varieties i.e., IPFD 10-12 (Green seeded), IPFD 11-5, IPFD 12-2 and IPFD 2014-2 suitable for central parts have been developed. In the case of North Eastern Plain Zone (NEPZ) comprising states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, West Bengal and eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh, very limited options are available among farmer for varietal selection due to dearth of varieties. In white seed category, VL-42 variety was the only choice for the growers released in 2007. During last 15 years, not a single variety was developed in this category, however, IPF 16-13 (Harit), a green seeded variety was developed by ICAR-IIPR, Kanpur. Therefore, being a national institute in the field of pulses research and development ICAR-IIPR, Kanpur is having more responsibility to develop suitable varieties of pulse crops for different agro-climatic conditions. The major focus of breeding programme was to breed high yielding and disease resistant semi-leafless or leafy dwarf type field pea variety for irrigated and rainfed areas. Consequently, concerted efforts have been made and two high-yielding field pea varieties i.e. Shikhar (IPFD 19-1) and Arpan (IPFD 19-3) have been developed which are suitable for cultivation in NEPZ. SHIKHAR (IPFD 19-1) is a dwarf and semi-leafless type field pea variety having white flower colour and creamish white colour seeds derived from the filial generations of cross synthesized in 2010-11 between field pea and vegetable type genotypes ‘IPF 5-19 and ‘MDP 2, respectively. ARPAN (IPFD 19-3) is another dwarf and leafy type field pea variety with white flower, round and creamish white seed. It is derived from the cross of ‘IPFD 1-10’ and ‘IPFD 10-13’ Indian Farming 74 (02): 09-11; February 2024 Indian Farming 10 February 2024 utilized as parents in 2010-2011. The subsequent generations of both the crosses were further advanced by selection of superior plants/ progenies during 2011 to 2017. The stabilized lines were evaluated in preliminary yield trials (PYT) and station trials during rabi 2017-18 and 2018-19, respectively, for grain yield and other yield attributes. All the selection and appraisal work was performed at ICAR-Indian Institute of Pulses Research, Kanpur. Considering the performance of IPFD 19-1 and IPFD 19-3 in station trials, both were entered in initial varietal trials (IVT) of the All India Coordinated testing programme of AICRP on MULLaRP during 2019-20. These varieties constantly out-performed the national, regional and local check varieties under National testing during 2019- 20 to 2021-22.
