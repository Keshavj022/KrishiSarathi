 Analytical techniques Various analytical methods were used to measure different analytes, such as iquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometery (LC-MS/MS) for pesticide residues in blood sam- ples, and DAP metabolites in urine samples, reversed-phase hight-performance liquid chro- matography (RP-HPLC) foracetylcholinesterase activity in blood. Detailed descriptions, including speciﬁcations and optimised conditions for each method, for its high sensitivity and speciﬁcity, ensuring the accuracy of our results. Each method was carefully selected for its ability to de- tect and quantify speciﬁc analytes to ensure the reliability of data collection and analysis for the study. 4.1.1. Analysis of pesticides from blood samples The pesticides in blood were effectively analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) according to the protocol of Kumar et al. [ 10 ]. The mass spectrometer operated with positive electrospray ionisation (ESI) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). A binary gradient solvent system of 10 mM ammonium formate and acetonitrile, a C18 column (1.8 μm particle size, 4.6 × 150 mm) was used for chromatography. A 20-μl sample was injected via an autosampler, allowing rapid detection of 33 pesticides within 20 minutes. The procedure involved analysing 100 μl of blood for 33 pesticides and included a simple liquid extraction. First, 100 μl of blood was collected in a clear glass tube and mixed with 900 μl of chilled acetonitrile (ACN). The mixture was shaken for 1 minute, cooled on ice for 10–20 minutes and ﬁltered through a 0.2 μl syringe ﬁlter prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. Validation and performance were performed according to SANTE guidelines for pesticide analysis. The method showed a linearity of > 0.9921 and a recovery range of 78.01–104.36 %. Precision and accuracy were maintained with an RSD of < 15 %. The lower limit of detection (LOD) and lower limit of quantiﬁcation (LOQ) were between 0.023–0.161 ng/mL and 0.072–0.487 6 D. Kumar, S.N.
