 However, it is advisable to apply 12-15 kg extra N in DSR than puddle transplanted rice. Following fertilizer doses are recommended for DSR: i. Local/Selection rice : 150 to 165 kg N/ha, 60 kg P2 O5 / ha, 60 kg K2 O/ha, and 25 kg Zinc sulphate/ ha) ii. Improved/hybrid rice : 60-75 Kg N/ha , 30 kg P2 O5 and 25 kg Zn SO4.   Apply full dose of P, K, and ZnSO4 and 23 kg N/ ha as basal at the time of sowing using seed cum fertilizer drill/planters. The remaining N should be applied in three equal splits at early tillering, active tillering and panicle initiation. Nitrogenous fertilizers can also be managed using leaf colour chart (LCC). Two approaches have been recommended to apply Nitrogen using LCC. Fixed time approach : After basal application of N, remaining N is applied at preset timing of active tillering and panicle initiation and dose is adjusted based on LCC reading of N application should be based on LCC value of 3 and 4 depending on cultivars. Real time approach : After basal application colour of rice leaves is monitored at regular interval of 7-10 days from active tillering. Weed management   Pre-germinated weeds can be knocked down with glyphosate/grammoxone (at 0.5% two days before seeding) or by 1-2 very shallow ploughings (stale seed bed method)  Pre- emergence (apply just after seeding preferably 2 DAS) Use pendimethalin @ 750 g a.i./ha as, pretilachor with safener 750 g a.i./ha  Post emergence: The right herbicide for use in DSR for post emergence application depends on the weed flora present in a given field; individual herbicides have strength and also weakness, e.g.bispyribac sodium is very good on grasses but can’t control Leptochloa. Rotational use of herbicides with different modes of actions is also desirable to check the possible development of herbicide tolerant or resistant weed biotypes. Timely use of newly-released effective herbicides in direct-seeded rice helps in better weed management and results in increase in yield besides increasing profitability. Sequential applications of a pre-emergence herbicide (e.g. pendimethalin 1000 g/ha, pyrazosulfuron is applied @ 20 g a.i./ ha ) followed by post- emergence herbicide (e.g., bispyribac-sodium (25 g/ha)/ penoxsulam (25 g/ha)/ azimsulfuron 30 g/ha/ fenoxaprop (with safener) (60g/ha)/ metsulfuron (4g/ha) + fenoxaprop (60 g/ha) can provide effective weed control in DSR. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 51 1.2 Transplanted Rice For ensuring maximum employment to rural youth transplanting of rice is best option. For raising seedlings, 1/10 th area is needed so we have to mange 1/10th area for a month for nursery preparation by that time onset of mansoon may occure and the transplanting may be done. It can be done manually or with the help of machine. Transplanting is commonly practiced as a method of weed control for wet or puddled fields. It requires less seed but much more labor compared to direct seeding.
