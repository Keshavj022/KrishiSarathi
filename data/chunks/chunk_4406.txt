50 acre in the same field adjacent to UTIPL’s crop for comparison. Potato varieties, seed and its preparation UTIPL provided G3 seed (size 36-45 mm) of two varieties – Kufri Pukhraj and Kufri Jyoti, 15 bags of each variety (having 50 kg seed in each bag). UTIPL’s seed was treated (sprayed) with Azoxystrobin (Amistar) 0.2% solution on 25th October 2020, kept in ventilated shade for 10-12 days for proper sprouting. Actually it was to be treated with 3% solution of boric acid powder (commercial grade) but the seed when reached Assam, started chitting/slight sprouting during transportation from Punjab which was de-cold stored and dispatched on 15th October 2020. Field showing plant emergence Healthy crop November–December 2021 43 Healthy crop Completion of earthing up Planting UTIPL’s two varieties were planted on 3rd and 5th November 2020 while farmer’s own crop on 4th November 2020 in such a way that planting time remain similar as it was not possible to plant all the crops in one day. In UTIPL’s crops also, all the operations were carried out manually. Planting was done by ridges and furrows method. Well sprouted seed tubers were planted at tuber- to-tuber distance of 20 cm and row-to-row distance of 60 cm at a depth of 10-12 cm. Fertilizers No green manuring /FYM application could be done. Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (NPK) fertilizers were applied @ 70, 69 and 60 kg/acre, respectively. Of which half dose of N (35 kg), two third dose of P (46 kg) and full dose of K (60 kg) were applied as basal dose while planting and remaining half dose of N (35 kg) and one third dose of P (23 kg) were applied at the time of earthing up after 25 days of planting. For applying above doses of NPK at planting and earthing up, following fertilizers, quantity and method were used. Basal: Urea 35 kg (broadcasting 2 days before planting), DAP 100 kg and MOP 100 kg (as banding at the time of planting) At earthing up: Urea 60 kg and DAP 50 kg (as banding). Pre-/post- emergence herbicide could not be applied to check the weeds. Earthing up It was done manually from 28 to 30 November 2020. Remaining doses of N and P as mentioned above were applied. Light irrigation was given on 1st and 2nd December 2020. Comparison of the trial crops by UTIPL and the farmer in the same field are shown below. This is the growth after 4 weeks of planting. Differences in growth are clearly visible. Officers from District Agriculture Office, Majuli, Assam visited the field on 30th November 2020 and appreciated a lot the crop stand, its health standard and the way the trial was being conducted by UTIPL. Crop comparison A week after earthing up and irrigation, the crop stand was very good. A month after earthing up and irrigation, lush green healthy crop was visible in the field (4th December 2020).
