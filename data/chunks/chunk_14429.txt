 The emission of different pollutant species, Espec (in Gigagrams, Gg), from CRB is esti­ mated using the following equation: Espec = Rp × Aaba × Fcult × Fdm × Eb × Femiss (1) where Rp is the crop-specific residue production (kg/ha), Aaba is ABA (ha) extracted from the MODIS BA products, Fcult is the fraction of crop- specific area out of the total area under cultivation for all selected crops, Fdm is a dry matter fraction specific to the crop that accounts for the moisture content of the residue during harvesting (Sahai et al., 2011), Eb is burn efficiency for which a constant value of 0.90 has been used (IPCC, 1996; Deshpande et al., 2022a), and finally Femiss is the emission factor in grams per kg of agricultural DMB, which is a representative value that attempts to relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the atmosphere with an activity associated with the release of that pollutant (Akagi et al., 2011; Van Der Werf et al., 2017). All the conversion factors have been listed in Table 1. Residue production (Rp) is estimated using the following equation: Rp = Pcrop × Fresd Acult (2) where Pcrop, represents the total crop production (in kg) for each district, Fresd is the crop-specific ratio of production to the residue and Acult is the crop area under cultivation. A detailed literature review was undertaken to determine each selected crop's Fresd optimal values (IPCC, 1996, 2006; Jain et al., 2014; Sahai et al., 2007, 2011; Sahu et al., 2021; Ven­ kataraman et al., 2006). We have considered two selection criteria for these values from the literature: the mean value from a maximum- minimum range or the most commonly accepted value in the litera­ ture. These values are listed in Table 1(A). Species-specific Femiss are listed in Table 1(B). 3.5. Comparison with other emission inventories We calculated annual emissions from our District-level Agricultural Residue Burning Emissions (DARBE) for 2011–2020 and compared them with existing global inventories. From the inventory data, we calculated emissions due only to agricultural residue burning at 0.10 resolution by applying the agricultural land type masks used to create DARBE. For the comparison, we used the following global inventories: the Fire Ener­ getics and Emissions Research (FEER) (Ichoku and Ellison, 2014), the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN v1.5) (Wiedinmyer et al., 2011), the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN v2.5) (Wiedinmyer et al., 2023), the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) (Kaiser et al., 2012) and Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED) version 2.5 (Darmenov and da Silva, 2013). The daily emission estimates from these inventories were used to obtain the state-level emissions from residue burning from 2011 to 2020, except for FINN v2.5, which is available only from 2012. 3.6. Uncertainty estimation We performed an uncertainty analysis to indicate the confidence level of our dataset, as each factor in the emissions calculation (Eq.
