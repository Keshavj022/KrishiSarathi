 Soil aliquots (15 g) from the biotic and heat-treated experiments were collected on days 1, 5, 20, and 40, placed in clean glass vials, immediately frozen, and stored at – 20 ◦C until extraction and analysis. 2.3. Field experiments 2.3.1. Study area The Berambadi experimental watershed (11◦43’00”–11◦48’00” N, 76◦31’00”–76◦40’00” E, 84 km2) is located in Karnataka, southwestern India. It is part of the South Gundal basin (816 km2), which belongs to the Kabini Critical Zone Observatory ([28]; SNO M-tropics, https://m tropics.obs-mip.fr/) (Fig. 1). Biophysical variables have been moni­ tored since 2010 through the Environmental Research Observatory M-TROPICS [29], part of the OZCAR research infrastructure [30]. The study plot consisted of red sandy clay loam Luvisol, comprising 60 % sand, 15 % silt, and 25 % clay, with a pH range of 7.1–7.9 (Table S-2). Detailed information on the climatic, pedological, and hydrogeological characteristics of the study plot is provided in the SI. 2.3.2. Characteristics of the plot soil, profenofos application, and soil sampling Topsoil samples (0–10 cm depth) were collected across the experi­ mental plot (10 ×10 m) within the Berambadi watershed (Fig. 1). Composite soil samples (1 kg each) consisted of pooled topsoil sub- samples systematically taken at 2 m intervals along three parallel tran­ sects within the plot. The sampling campaign began on May 23rd, 2022, one day before the profenofos application (denoted as t = – 1 day). The day – 1 composite sample was used to assess background profenofos concentration in the plot, determine extraction recoveries of profenofos from the soil, and evaluate potential carbon stable isotope fractionation associated with the soil extraction procedure (Table S-3). On this plot, the local farmer applied profenofos to the bare soil just after beetroot sowing on 24th May 2022. The application was conducted within a single day in three successive passes, each separated by a 2 h interval. The commercial formulation, ROCKET 44 EC, was diluted with water at a ratio of 1:1000 (v/v) and applied at a rate of 0.57 L.m⁻². This corresponded to a profenofos dose of 2.4 kg.ha⁻¹ or 243 mg.m⁻², which is five times the recommended application rate. Subsequent samples were collected on days 0 (3 h after the profenofos application), 1, 3, 7, 10, 15, 22, and day 34 (June 27th, 2022). The agricultural practices encompass ploughing and the cultivation of one to three successive crops annually. These crops typically include rainfed crops and short-cycle irrigated crops, such as onions, beetroot and potatoes [31]. 2.3.3. POCIS preparation and deployment In-house Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) de­ vices were prepared as previously described [32] to evaluate the occurrence of pesticides in groundwater. Briefly, 250 mg of HyperSep™ Retain (Thermo Scientific) sorbent, equivalent to Oasis HLB sorbent (Waters), was used.
