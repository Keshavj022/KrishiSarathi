35 kg/palm/year, 14 bunches, bunch weight- 14.16 kg), palm no. 273 (FFB yield- 186.32 kg/palm/ year, 12 bunches, bunch weight- 15.52 kg) were identified. Cashew: One trait-specific cashew germplasm RFRS-195 identified having low CNSL (13.01%) in High yielding oil palm germplasm Oil palm germplasm with high fresh fruit bunch yield and short stature The following elite genotypes were identified: IC061001-60, Dura genotype with short stature (28.9 cm), more FFB yield (243.91 kg) and 13 bunches. IC060051-71, Dura genotype with more FFB yield (261.71 kg) and 16.66 bunches. IC061001-59, Tenera genotype with low annual height increment (25.25 cm) and more FFB (211.33 kg) yield. Pomegranate accessions GENETIC RESOURCES ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 30 Pea genotypes resistant to powdery mildew: Two exotic collections from late maturity groups of peas, viz. EC 865944 and EC 865975 were observed immune to powdery mildew under controlled as well as natural field screening over the period of three years with 0 PDI score. medium tall (120–130 cm), dark green fruit free from ring formation and easy to harvest. VRO 210 is resistant to YVMV and OELCV virus. More yield potential (160–165 q/ha), semi-dwarf (100– 110 cm), dark green fruit colour free from ring formation and easy to harvest. Muskmelon: The genotype VRMM 41 is a green fleshed genotype having average fruit weight (850 g), number of fruits/plant (2–4), yield/plant (3.7 kg) and TSS (11°Brix). Tuber crops Potato: Three germplasms were identified and registered with ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi. MCD 24 (INGR 21075) potato wild species clone: MCD 24 (Solanum microdontum; Accession number: PI 218224) is highly resistant to late blight. This accession is diploid with diverse genetic base. VRP Sel-17, a pea genotype bearing single flower per peduncle on all the floral nodes The genotype exhibited consistent flowering behaviour of single FPP on all the reproductive nodes. It is also resistant to powdery mildew and rust under natural field conditions. Despite its low pod yield (60–70 g/ plant), this genotype can be used in a variety of genetic studies, including inheritance of flower numbers, flowering time, peduncle traits, seed and pod characters, disease studies, and so on. VRP Sel-17: (a) Single flower per peduncle, (b) Single pod per peduncle, and (c) Seed filling in pods (a) Resistant genotypes ‘EC 865944’ and ‘EC 865975’; (b) Grown with susceptible genotype under huge disease pressure in natural field conditions Okra: Okra genotype VRO 146 is resistant to YVMV and OELCV virus. More yield potential (170–175 q/ha), semi-dwarf (100–106 cm), dark green fruit colour, free from ring formation and easy to harvest. Okra genotype VRO 208 is resistant to YVMV and OELCV virus. More yield potential (160–170 q/ha), VRO-146 VRO-208 VRO-210 MSH/14-129 (INGR 21074) potato hybrid: MSH/14- 129 is inter-specific somatic hybrid-derived clone [cv. Kufri Gaurav × somatic hybrid P 2 (S. tuberosum + S.
