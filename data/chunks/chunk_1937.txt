 The use of Deep Learning in different fields of agriculture, including smart farming is seed analysis, water management, soil analysis, weed and pest detection, stress detection, plant disease detection and crop yield detection. (Source:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-neural-networks-and-its-applications/) Figure 20: Artificial Neural Networks Artificial Neural Networks consist of artificial neurons referred to as units, organized in layers that collectively form the entire neural network within a system. The number of units in a layer can vary significantly, ranging from a dozen to millions, depending on the complexity required for the neural network to discern hidden patterns in the dataset. Typically, an Artificial Neural Network includes an input layer, an output layer, and hidden layers. The input layer receives external data that the neural network aims to analyze or learn. Subsequently, this data traverses one or multiple hidden layers, where it undergoes transformations to become valuable input for the output layer. Ultimately, the output layer generates a response, presenting the output of the Artificial Neural Network in response to the provided input data. In most neural networks, units are interconnected between layers, and each connection possesses weights that dictate the impact of one unit on another. As data moves from one unit to another, the neural network progressively learns more about the data, culminating in an output from the output layer.
