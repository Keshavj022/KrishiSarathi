 This urdbean variety possess multiple disease resistance. Narmada is highly resistant to mungbean yellow mosiac virus and resistant to urdbean leaf crinkle virus, leaf curl virus, web blight, bacterial leaf blight, powdery mildew and Cercospora leaf spots. Resistance to white fly, pod borer and pod bug insects under field conditions was also observed for Narmada based on multi-location data. It is further early maturing (74 days) and tolerant to pod shattering. Narmada has attractive black seed colour, bold seeds (4.87 g/100 seeds) with high protein content (20.27%), and is highly palatable. Similarly, IPU17-2 (Dristi) was also thoroughly tested in different agro-climatic regions of Madhya Pradesh, alongwith check varieties, IPU 13-1, IPU 10-26 and KU 96-3. While tested over muti- location, performance of the variety showed yield superiority of 18.33%. The variety was tested in Betul, Narsinghpur, and Hoshangabad districts of Madhya Pradesh during spring 2021. Dristi showed wider adaptability owing to its suitability for cultivation across different agro- climatic regions of Madhya Pradesh. It was also exhaustively tested in Narmada (IPU19-10) Dristi (IPU17-2) Field view and seeds of Narmada and Dristi Indian Farming 8 February 2024 AICRP across all the zones in the country in IVT during summer 2021 and 2018-19 and yield varied from 692 kg/ha to 1369 kg/ha. Dristi also carries resistance to various diseases like yellow mosaic disease, urdbean leaf crinkle, leaf curl virus, Table 1.
