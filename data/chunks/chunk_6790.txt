The system consists of a single board computer (Raspberry Pi Zero W); wide angle (1500) camera module; BME 280 weather sensor and a GSM transmitter. The standalone system is powered by 10 W solar panel with a rechargeable NiCd battery. A control unit triggers the camera module at hourly intervals to record an image of trapped insects along with the data on temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and altitude. The combined data is optimized and transmitted via 4G GSM and delivered via an e-mail client and mobile application. The field testing of wireless smart trap at CICR Farm, Coimbatore showed a weekly mean trap catch of 19.8 (P. gossypiella), 6.18 (S. litura), 0.19 (H. armigera) and 0.08 (E. vittella) during the season 2021–22. The cost of fabrication was ₹14,430/ trap with a recurring amount of ₹1,447 for GSM data and sticky liner replacement. The smart trap can be used for area-wide pest monitoring and the recurring cost can be minimized with cost-effective data transmission using Long Range Radio (LoRa) technology. By investigating the real-time trap catch with corresponding weather data, the area-wide pest dynamics could be integrated with a pest forewarning system for cost-effective pest management in cotton. Microbial-based volatile compounds to trap sucking pests in cotton: Among several eco-friendly options for pest management, bioprospecting microbial- based volatile compounds (mVOCs) are novel and hopeful. mVOCs are small, odorous, low molecular weight compounds, with high vapor pressure and act as a long-distance messenger. Based on the pest attraction efficiency, four mVOCs formulations were short-listed from 150 mVOCs combinations and evaluated @5 ppm concentration on the attraction of major sucking pests of cotton (whiteflies, jassids, aphids and thrips) using yellow sticky traps (YST) in a large-scale replicated field trails at Nagpur, Coimbatore and Sirsa. The mean field trap catches were counted at 40–80 days sucking pest window and expressed as a percentage increase over the control. Among the mVOCs formulations, CICRMV-W, CICRMV-J, CICRMV-A, and CICRMV-T trapped 232%, 1517%, 709% and 237% fold higher whiteflies, jassids, aphids and thrips as compared to the control.

Treating cotton seeds with mVOCs was found to act as biostimulants. Based on the literature survey, the short-listed mVOCs are found to be safe and find a place in our day today use as per the toxicological data available.
