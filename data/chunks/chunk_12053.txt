4 mg kg-1 in un-inoculated control hence the strain has a potential to be promoted as bio-inoculants to mitigate P, Zn and Fe deficiency in soils. 6.

Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/ species): AMF consortium of Glomus mosseae, Glomus intraradices and Glomus sp. 2. Target crops and delivery system: Soybean, Wheat 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): Central Zone or regions with vertisols 4. Validation and commercialization: AMF production under on-farm system can be achieved up to 25 IP/g soil (from less than 1 IP/g soil) after three years involving multiple consecutive multiplicative cycles consisting annual/seasonal trap plants. Sufficient number of propagules can be produced on 10 m2 area which can meet the requirement of 25 acre field. 5. Benefits: AMF application can save upto 25% of external P fertilizers. The on-farm production of local strains of AMF is suitable for marginal farmers and also suitable for small medium size enterprise. Less expensive since the system can also be used for production of transplant seedlings. Enhanced shelf life (up to 50 °Celsius at 5-8% moisture). 6.

Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/ species): Biocapsules; encompasses any bacterial or fungal or actinobacterial strain 2. Target crops and delivery system: All crops, delivery by encapsulation 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): For all agro-ecological zones 4. Validation and commercialization: Validated in multi-location trials and commercialized 5.
