Organic manure placement in seed furrows has proved useful under rainfed farming. FYM (10 tonnes/ha) along with the recommended doses of NPK resulted in significant yield increases of pop corn with 66 cm × 15 cm row spacing and 66.6 thousand plants/hectare. For weed management, intercropping with soybean and use of Alachlor and Pedamenthalin were effective. BARLEY Crop Improvement DWR 28 barley, the first two-row malt barley, has been developed through hybridization programme. So far only the direct introductions, Alfa 93 and BCU 73, have been released. JH 3459 maize is promising for rainfed and irrigated areas of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab for kharif cultivation SEED PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY FOR SORGHUM Hybrids CSH 18 and CSH 19 of sorghum have showed proper synchrony of flowering and highest seed set with staggered sowing. GA spray at 400 ppm on R 354 and 250 ppm on Indore 12 at primordial initiation showed highest seed set. Seed quality traits, field emergence, root length, seedling dry weight and vigour index, differed significantly from 12 to 24 months of storage due to moisture. ● ●● ●● The dual-purpose CSV 15 sorghum of 102 days duration has brought back the phased out chickpea in rotation. ● Two new male sterile lines on A 2 sorghum cytoplasm and 2 new male sterile lines on Maldandi cytoplasm have been developed. ● Jaggery prepared from NSS 104 and SSV 84 sorghum has confectionery taste.

S O R G H U M Crop Improvement Kharif sorghum: The dual-purpose variety CSV 15 of 102 days duration has made impact on the whole cropping system, and has brought back the phased out chickpea in rotation. Now the farmer can get assured grain yield of sorghum up to 3.5 tonnes/ha with disease-free, stay-green plants up to maturity, and can vacate field 38 days before the time, for enabling early sowing of chickpea to minimize wilt disease due allelopathic effect. SPV 1,474 with 3,826 kg/ha grain yield exhibited 8.4% and 16.5% superiority over improved CSV 15 and CSV 13.
