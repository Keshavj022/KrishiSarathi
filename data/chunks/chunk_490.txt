 Enhanced growth in hydroponic systems: A noticeable outcome of cultivating plants within a hydroponic system is the marked increase in growth. Plants nurtured through hydroponics exhibit a growth rate that is notably accelerated, typically ranging between 30 to 50% faster compared to conventional agricultural practices. This accelerated growth can be attributed to the optimal provision of nutrients and reduced exposure to environmental stressors. In traditional farming, plants often contend with stressors such as pests and weather fluctuations, which can impede their development. However, hydroponic systems mitigate these stressors, fostering an environment conducive to swift and robust growth. Notably, certain plant species display a more pronounced acceleration in growth within hydroponic setups. For instance, crops like tomatoes and lettuce are recognized for their heightened growth rates when cultivated through hydroponics. By judiciously selecting compatible plant varieties for hydroponic system, one can harness the potential for exceptionally bountiful yields. By embracing a hydroponic system, you can cultivate a substantially greater quantity of plants compared to conventional agricultural techniques. While there exist alternative farming approaches aimed at space conservation, hydroponic farming stands out as the most advantageous method in this particular aspect. Benefits of hydroponics farming • No soils needed: In a sense, you can grow crops in places where the land is limited, doesn’t exist, or is heavily contaminated or degraded. Hydroponics has been considered the farming of the future to grow foods for astronauts in space (where there is no soil). • Make better use of space and location: As all that plant’s needs are provided and maintained in a controlled environment/system, it can be grown indoors and vertically multiplied produce per square feet to multifold.

In this sense, you can grow foods all year round, regardless of the season. Farmers can produce foods at the appropriate time to maximize their business profits. • Water-saving: Plants grown hydroponically can use only 10–25% of water compared to field-grown ones. In this method, water is re-circulated. Plants will take up the necessary water, while run-off ones will be captured and returned to the system. Water loss only occurs in two forms - evaporation and leaks from the system (but an efficient hydroponic setup will minimize or don’t have any leaks).
