 Grape: An innovative approach combining an integrated miniaturized spectrometer with support vector machines and convolutional neural networks has been employed to identify 64 grapevine varieties from a dataset of 35,833 samples, marking the first application of these technologies in grapevine variety identification. Furthermore, the use of transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques based on the AlexNet architecture has been explored for identifying grape varieties. Apple and pear: A lightweight backbone network based on residual network architecture has been developed to enhance the real-time computational performance of network models, demonstrating effectiveness in the real- time detection and segmentation of apples and branches in orchards. Furthermore, the creation of a robust image labeling algorithm and an efficient deep learning detector, known as ‘LedNet,’ has enabled real-time and accurate apple detection in orchards, providing a fast and effective framework that has been validated. The development of a multi-task network, DaSNet-v2, has also achieved real- time and accurate fruit detection, segmentation, and 3D visualization in apple orchards. An automatic method for identifying apple defects has been developed using laser-induced light backscattering imaging along with a convolutional neural network (CNN). The AlexNet model achieved a recognition rate of 92.5%, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to conventional machine learning algorithms. To classify apples into mealy and non-mealy categories, pre-trained convolutional neural networks AlexNet and VGGNet were utilized, achieving accuracies of 91.11 and 86.94%, respectively. An improved Mask R-CNN model utilizing the U-Net method has enabled instance segmentation of apple flowers across three different growth stages, incorporating image augmentation and segmentation Indian Horticulture 56 Overview of artificial intelligence-assisted tools and technologies, illustrating their potential as prerequisites for horticultural crop improvement through the integration of diverse functional aspects under occlusion and overlap conditions. The proposed YOLO-V3 network, enhanced with DenseNet, allows for real-time detection of apples at three different growth stages in orchards, handling high-resolution images under occlusion and overlap. Citrus: A novel technique employing small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), multispectral imaging, and deep learning convolutional neural networks has been developed to evaluate phenotypic characteristics in citrus fruits. This method has proven successful in detecting and counting citrus trees and estimating canopy size with significant accuracy. Remote sensing is integral to precision agriculture, and UAVs are revolutionizing workflows for measuring crop conditions, identifying weeds, and conducting other agricultural assessments.
