 Crop diversification opportunities Economic status of farmers: Crop diversification helps to increase income of small land holding farmers and they can better tolerate the ups and downs in price of various farm products and may ensure economic stability of farming products. To overcome this, existing cropping patterns must be diversified with high value crops such as maize, pulses, vegetables etc. Balance food demand: Most of the Indian population suffers from malnutrition. Crop diversification including crops like pulses, oilseeds, horticulture and vegetable crops can improve socio-economic status by adding quality to the food basket and also improve soil health Table 3.

Employment generation: Employment generation is a significant role of agriculture. There is a serious problem of seasonal unemployment in different regions of the country, which leads to seasonal migration of labours/ farmers to nearby cities/towns in quest of contractual work. Crop diversification helps rural households to have more opportunities of full-time employment. Conservation of natural resources: Adoption of crop diversification helps in conservation of natural resources like introduction of legume in cereal based cropping system has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen to sustain soil fertility and also reduce soil erosion. Risk reduction: Crop diversification is very much responsive to climatic and biotic vagaries, particularly in fragile ecosystems by expanding locally adapted or introducing novel varieties and related production systems will help resource-poor farmers to improve their food security and income generation while also protecting the environment. Under sudden adverse weather conditions like erratic rainfall, drought, hail, incidence of insect and pest disease, crop diversification through mixed cropping may be useful. SUMMARY Rainfed agriculture is challenged by many abiotic and biotic constraints, particularly weather aberrations in cropping season.
