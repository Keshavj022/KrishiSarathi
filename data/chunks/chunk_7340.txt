 It attains harvestable bulb maturity at 111 days after transplanting. Medicinal plants Cassia tora accessions with high anthraquinone glycosides emodin and chrysophenol identified: Cassia tora is a small shrub and grows as common weed in Asia. Many medicinal properties such as antimicrobial, antihepatotoxic and antimutagenic activities are attributed to C. tora. Two anthraquinone glycosides namely emodin and chrysophenol were GENETIC RESOURCES ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 26 quantified in seed extracts of Cassia tora samples through reversed phase, high performance liquid chromatography method. Emodin (EM) content (%) ranged from 0.0015 to 0.0182% with a mean of 0.0079. Maximum EM content (%) was observed in DCT-2 (0.0182), followed by DCT-19 (0.0179), DCT-21 (0.0178) and DCT-1 (0.0152). Chrysophenol (CRYP) content (%) ranged from 0.0058–0.1002%. Maximum CRYP was observed in DCT-4 (0.1002), followed by DCT-14 (0.0538), DCT-10 (0.0458) and DCT-5 (0.0413). Minimum CRYP was recorded in DCT-41 and DCT-28 (0.0058), followed by DCT-36 (0.0082). Garcinia species with high content of cytotoxic polyisoprenylated benzophenone identified: A Garcinia species was identified which had higher content of xanthochymol in comparison to G. spicata. Further, a single step process was developed for isolation of xanthochymol. Indian ginseng (Withania somnifera): Of the 327 pure lines of Indian ginseng evaluated, 10 lines such as, DWS-184, DWS-228, DWS-266, DWS-290, DWS- 296, DWS-300 and DWS-315 were identified with higher (0.4%) anolides content. Germplasm sharing: A total of 1,314 germplasm accessions in 18 different vegetable crops such as tomato (134), garden pea (42), cowpea (227), brinjal (139), Indian/Dolichos bean (16), muskmelon (45), French bean (26), cluster bean (50), watermelon (53), cucumber (77), chilli (165), winged bean (20), okra (234), bottle gourd (12), sponge gourd (22), bitter gourd (11), pumpkin (16), cauliflower (16) etc., were distributed to 40 organizations/institutes/universities through Material Transfer Agreement for use in demonstration and research. Germplasm registration Wood apple: Thar Gaurav, a new variety with large fruit (450.25 g), 124.36 kg/tree fruit yield in 12th year under rainfed conditions of western India was identified. The fruits are rich in pectin (1.76%), protein (pulp 18.13% and seed 24.38%), phosphorus (0.07%), potassium (1.73%), calcium (0.3%) and iron (16.72 mg) content. Khejri: Thar Shobha and Selection-2 were registered with ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi with IC number 632064 and 632065, respectively. Date palm: One elite, male date palm promising for more pollen production (672.7 g/palm) and number of spathes (25–30/palm) was identified and registered (IC No. 0632315) with ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi. Drumstick: One medium-dwarf genotype (CHESD- 40) with 2.74 m plant height, 248 pods, 218 g pod weight, 8–10 seed per pod and 8.9 °Brix was identified promising under rainfed conditions of semi-arid regions of Gujarat.
