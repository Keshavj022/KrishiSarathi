 Case studies from different states demonstrate the effectiveness of these models, with increase in household income, improved crop yields, and reduced input costs through natural nutrient cycling. Livestock and fisheries also contribute essential sources of protein and nutrition, strengthening nutritional security at household in rural areas. Moreover, these farming systems provide greater adaptability and resilience to climate challenges such as droughts and floods, enabling farmers to maintain production and income in adverse conditions. This approach supports the development of more sustainable, productive, and resilient food production systems, ensuring long-term livelihood security for rural communities. Keywords: Fisheries, Livelihoods, Livestock, Nutritional security, Rainfed regions R AINFED regions occupy approximately 52% of India’s net sown area and contributes nearly 40% of the country’s total food production. These complex and highly diverse regions face significant challenges due to their dependency on erratic rainfall patterns and susceptibility to droughts. Vulnerability of rural livelihoods in these areas is compounded by climate variability and water scarcity. Traditional crop-based agriculture often fails to meet the livelihood needs of farmers in these regions, leading to income and nutritional insecurity. Livestock and fisheries-based farming systems in these regions provides a vital strategy for building resilience, diversifying income sources, and improving resource efficiency. Livestock contribute to rural economies through the sale of milk, meat, eggs, and manure, while fisheries provide income from fish production. By having multiple income sources, farmers are less vulnerable to the risks associated with crop failure or market fluctuations, creating a more stable livelihood base. Significance of livestock and fisheries India’s dairy sector has grown significantly, making India the world’s largest producer of milk, with an annual production of 209.96 million tonnes. The dairy sector alone contributes 4% to India’s GDP, making it one of the most critical contributors to rural livelihoods. Indian Farming 75 (01): 60-63; January 2025 The meat sector also plays an essential role, contributing 1.7% to the national GDP, with an annual production of 8.2 million tonnes. This sector includes cattle, buffalo, poultry, sheep, and goats, which are key sources of income for rural. The egg sector contributes 0.77% to GDP, producing 122.05 billion eggs annually, and is growing at a rate of 8-10% per year, which further supports food security and rural income. The fisheries sector is another cornerstone of rural livelihoods, particularly in areas with access to water bodies. India is the second-largest producer of fish globally, with fisheries contributing 1.24% to the national GDP and 7.28% to agricultural GDP.
