Indian Farming 19 August 2023 energy and C-intensive zone for rice-based cropping systems, hence, there is an urgent need to deigns more efficient production systems, which are more productive, climate resilient, C-and energy- efficient and environmentally sustainable. Although the millet- based production systems have been proved to be highly efficient in terms of system productivity and profitability but their adoption and substitution for rice-wheat cropping system is a difficult task in eastern IGP due to fact that rice and wheat have become a major food staple. Being rich in nutrients and dietary fibres, millets need to be promoted as nutri-cereals in the diets of rural poor. The government policies should be changed in favour of millet-based production systems for wider adoption. Hence, the existing rice-wheat cropping system may be diversified with the substitution of climate-resilient millet-based production systems, which are more productive, resource use-efficient, energy-cum-carbon-efficient and low emitter of GHGs. SUMMARY Thus, there is need of climate resilient and better remunerative cropping systems to be developed for making country self-sufficient in food and nutrition on available limited farm resources, viz. land, labour, capital and infrastructure. Crop productivity of prominent cropping systems can be increased by many times by adoption of alternative productive and profitable cropping systems. This can be done by inclusion of new crops in prevailing cropping systems of different agro-climatic zone.
