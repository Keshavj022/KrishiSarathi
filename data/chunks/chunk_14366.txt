 Basal soil respiration indicates microbial mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) stock leading to output of CO2 from soil, which is strongly related to the types and amount of carbon input to soil (Zhang et al., 2019). Stable carbon inputs like sole biochar application (BC100) reduced the soil respiration in both the years (Table 1). However, the reduction in soil respiration was comparatively higher in 2020 than that in 2019 (Fig. 7). However, the integrated application of biochar with chemical fertilizers (CF75+BC25 and CF50+BC 50) did not change significantly in both years. The highest soil respiration in all the nutrient management treatments was observed during the panicle initiation stage of paddy in both years, which can be attributed to the role of root exudates promoting microbial oxidation of soil carbon (Canarini 12 A. Singh, K. Abbhishek, J. Kuttippurath et al. Environmental Technology & Innovation 27 (2022) 102498 et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). However, resistant carbon alternatives like compost application (CO100) lead to increased soil respiration during panicle initiation in 2020 compared to that in 2019, which might be due to the residual effect of compost application in paddy crops. The highest (7.4–8.6 µg-CO2/g-soil/hr) carbon emission is observed with chemical fertilizer application to paddy soil, as they serve as a readily available source of nitrogen in microbial metabolism. However, chemical fertilizers when applied in an integrated manner (INM) with compost (CF75+CO25 and CF50+CO50) or biochar (CF75+BC25 and CF50+BC50) reduced the soil respiration than the sole application of compost or chemical fertilizer, but it emitted more CO2 than that by sole biochar application (BC100). Our results agree with Wei et al. (2021), who reported decreased soil respiration with biochar application. We observe that increasing doses of biochar (e.g., CF75+BC25, CF50+BC50 and BC100) reduce the soil respiration progressively and is evident in all three growth stages of rice in both years. The reduction in microbe-mediated soil respiration can be attributed to the immobilization of organic acids and messenger molecules required in bacterial quorum sensing with increasing doses of biochar (Gao et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2020). However, the results for soil respiration in the case of compost application were just the opposite of biochar, which showed the highest emission (5.5–8.09 µg-CO2/g-soil/hr) with maximum dose (CO100). Therefore, results of our analyses indicate that biochar can be a better substitute of compost in the nutrient management strategies of paddy with lower soil respiration. However, our results for grain yield per hill of paddy were highest (37.65 g hill−1) in low dose biochar-based INM treatment (Table 1); indicating better nutrient uptake in the low dose biochar treatment. Henceforth, findings indicate that biochar fertilizer in low doses can be a beneficial strategy in the sustainable yield improvement of paddy.
