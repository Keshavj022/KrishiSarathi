0 tonnes/ha of pod), early maturing (119 days) and medium bold seeded (43 gl100 kernel) spreading groundnut variety has been identified (2005) for kharif rainfed situations of southern peninsular states namely, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala in addition to southern Maharashtra • A high yielding, semi‐spreading bold seeded high oil yielding variety, PBS 24030 has been identified for kharif situation for Rajasthan, UP, Punjab • A high yielding, erect variety, JL 501 has been identified for kharif situation for Gujarat and Southern Rajasthan • 900 q of groundnut breeder seeds of 45 improved groundnut varieties were produced during the period under report II. Crop Production • Irrigation applied at 50% of available soil moisture with water deficit imposed in between 10‐40 days after sowing combined with FYM 10 t Iha and RDF resulted in highest pod yield at Digraj. • Flat bed with polythene mulch produced higher pod yield as compared to BBF and without mulch at Dharwad. At Vriddhachalam, polythene mulch on paired row system gave the highest pod yield (2407 kg/ha) and BCR (2.21). Irrigation applied at 0.6 CPE and recommended dose of fertiliser along with Rhizobium and PSM gave the highest yield and also BCR. • Seed inoculation with Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobia 2, 4 or mixture of strains (1 +2+4 ) provided the highest pod and the yield increase was in the range of 12.2 to 34.4% over the control at most AICRP‐G centres • Inter row water harvesting technique gave the highest pod yield (2665 kg/ha); 53.9% higher than the control. Broad bed and furrow method found effective in conserving soil moisture and increasing pod yield. This technology was also found remunerative and recorded higher Net returns (Rs. 17,553) as compared to the control (Rs. 16,459/‐) www.icar.org.in 40 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science • In Groundnut + Pigeon pea inter cropping system, maintaining plant density of 100% in groundnut and 75% in pigeon pea or 75% of groundnut and pigeon pea, and fertilizing with 50% of to both the crops found most optimal combination and remunerative at Dharwad Jalgaon and Junagadh • In groundnut + cluster bean intercropping, application of 100% recommended dose of fertilizer to groundnut and 50% to cluster bean, and maintaining 75% and 100% plant density, respectively, recorded maximum gross returns (Rs 41,343/as against Rs.37934) over control • Soil of ZnSo4 @ 30 kglha to kharif groundnut and no application of ZnSo4 to succeeding wheat crop increased pod yield of groundnut by 27% and grain yield of wheat by 18.3% over no applicatic'll of ZnS04 to kharif groundnut. The BCR realized through this treatment was to the tune of 9.93. • During rabi/summer, irrigation applied at 50% depletion of available soil moisture with water deficits imposed between 10‐40 days, combined with FYM @ 10 tlha and recommended dose of fertilizer resulted in the highest pod and kernel yield 4566 and 3006 kglha, respectively at Dharwad and Digraj.
