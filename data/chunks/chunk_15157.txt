 The precision rates of XGBoost for recommending agricultural crops, horticultural crops, and a combination of both were 99.09 % (AUC 1.0), 99.3 % (AUC 1.0), and 98.51 % (AUC 0.99), respectively. This non-intrusive method for generating crop recommendations in diverse environmental conditions holds the potential to provide valuable insights for the development of a user-friendly AI cloud-based interface. Such an interface would enable rapid decision-making for optimal fertilizer applications and the selection of suitable crops for cultivation at specific sites. 1. Introduction The economy of South Asia heavily relies on agriculture [1], which plays a vital role in ensuring both human survival and economic growth [2,3]. For over 13,000 years, people have been relying on it as their primary source of sustenance, and it remains the main food source for the worldâ€™s population [4]. According to a projection, the current global population of 7.8 billion is projected to increase to 9.8 billion by 2050 [5], among them over 800 million individuals still lack sufficient access to food, and approximately 10 % of food production is lost due to factors such as pests, diseases, and adverse weather conditions [6]. These circumstances resulted in food insecurity, one of the biggest challenges that humanity is currently confronting in the 21st century [7]. To meet the growing global * Corresponding author.

The agricultural production heavily relies on local weather and climate conditions, as well as the occurrence and duration of extreme weather events [8,9], when making decisions about crop management. Inadequate availability of soil nutrients can have a negative impact on the biochemical and physiological performance of plants, ultimately resulting in reduced crop yields [10]. Maintaining soil productivity over the long term requires a balanced use of both organic and inorganic fertilizers, particularly in cases where the organic matter content is relatively low [11]. The fertility of the soil, growth of crops, and sustainable yield are all influenced by the kind and amount of fertilizers used, whether they are organic, inorganic, or a mixture of both. It is essential to regulate soil fertility in a logical manner and supplement any lacking nutrients through external fertilization to achieve a fruitful crop harvest, as suggested by sources [10,12].
