 This period recorded normal growth and development. It has been observed that the germination of microgreens varies from seed to seed. Notably, a slow growth was noted under conditions of low light or complete absence of light. Marchâ€“April 2024 35 Growing Media and Seed Quality Taking into account the prevailing conditions and resource availability, vegetable seeds were cultivated in a blend of coco peat and vermicompost. The ratio of these two components, set at 3:1, has proven to be effective. Untreated and non-GMO seeds, labelled as such, were sourced from various farms across the state. An alternative approach to traditional fungal treatment involved pretreating seeds with Trichoderma viridae, offering a practical and viable option. Sowing Time Seeds can be sown at any time, as needed. It is crucial to thoroughly clean the trays and sow the seeds judiciously. Following the sowing process, the trays are placed within the specially designed microgreen vertical farming unit. Watering, Growth and Nutrient Management A single misting during sowing, followed by tray stacking, is sufficient to facilitate germination. Depending on the vegetable variety and temperature conditions, germination typically begins within 3-5 days post-sowing. Once yellowish cotyledon leaves emerge, trays can be unstacked. After root establishment, a bottom watering method is introduced, applying 50-70 ml of high-quality drinking water. The concept of fertigation proves beneficial in microgreen farming, as seedling development does not demand intricate nutrient management. Utilizing liquid organic fertilizers mixed with water has shown positive and luxuriant growth results. Harvesting The initiation of germination in vegetables occurs within 2-4 days after sowing, influenced by the specific variety and temperature conditions. Certain vegetables like Purple radish sango, China pink rose, and mustard can be harvested within 8 to 12 days under summer conditions. However, varietals like basil require a longer period, typically 20-25 days, to reach the optimal size for harvesting. Disease and Pest Control Fungal issues are prevalent in low-quality or reused growing media, and practicing proper sanitary measures is an effective preventive measure. Elevated relative humidity has consistently led to the regular occurrence of both fungal growths. Among various pests, fruit flies stand out as the most prominent insect. A straightforward solution involves suspending a plastic bottle filled with a small amount of apple cider vinegar, featuring a hole punched at the top for control and hanging to the rack installed. CONCLUSION Colder regions of all Himalayan states of India have numerous geographical constraints with limited agricultural activities. Under such situations, the availability of fresh vegetables particularly green leafy diets eventually leads to nutritional compromise in the region.
