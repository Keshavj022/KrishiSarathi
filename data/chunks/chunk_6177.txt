 Number of fruits/branch retained at harvest Maximum number of fruits per branch at harvest was observed in T1 (16.6) compared that during autumn season of 2003 (Table 1). Average fruit weight (g/fruit) Bending of varieties (T1) produced highest fruit weight (190 g/fruit), followed by T2 and T3 with 186.0 and 182 g/fruit respectively (Table 1). Khaja All the morphological and yield-attributing characters of the plant showed a trend of variation similar to that of the previous year of observation (during Autumn 2002 and Summer 2003). Days required to emergence of new shoot In both the seasons early emergence of shoot was observed in T1, and T2 compared with the control. However, during summer 2004 the emergence of new shoot after the treatment was very early, producing new shootlet within 9.7 days and 15.0 days in T1 and T2 respectively compared with 29.0 days and 34 days in T1 and T2 during autumn, 2003.

Profuse fruitlets after bending Contents HORTICULTURAL CROPS Number of new shootlet/branch Production of new shootlet was increased in all the treatments during summer seasons com- pared with autumn season. Bending of branch (T1) gave maximum number of new shootlets per branch (15.2), whereas T2 and T3 (control) recorded 7.6 and 6.4 shootlet/branch respectively (Table 2). Days required to initiate flowering Table 2 shows that during summer flowering started earlier than in autumn season in all the treatments. Bending of shoot (T1) required 29.7 and 48.0 days during summer and autumn bending respectively. Days required for fruit set Table 2 reveal that early fruit set was recorded in T1, in both the season followed by T2 and T3. Lowest period of 43.1 days was required for fruit set in summer bending of shoot, whereas the same treatment (T1) took 68 days for fruit set during autumn bending. Table 2.

Khaja) as affected by re-structuring of canopies during autumn 2002-03 and summer 2003-04 Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Pair of new leaves per shootlet at flowering time The maximum pair of new leaves was observed at flowering time with control plants in both the seasons, i.e. 6.5 and 7.0 pairs in autumn and summer season respectively. However, other treatments also showed slight increment in pair of new leaves/shootlet during summer season than autumn season (Table 2). Number of shootlets with flower buds/branch About 88% of the newly emerged shoots produced flower buds during autumn bending (Table 2), whereas only 46.05% of the newly emerged shoot produced flower buds during bending in summer season. During summer season due to warm and humid condition the newly emerged shootlets made excess growth and became vegetative instead of producing flowers in them. Number of flowers/shootlet The number of flowers per shootlet did not vary significantly among the treatments in both the season. However, maximum flowers per shootlet (8.
