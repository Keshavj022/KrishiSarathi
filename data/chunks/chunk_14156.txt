However, the evidence accumulated so far demonstrates that this is not a sustain- able path in the long run. To promote SAPs, India needs to switch its focus from food security to nutrition security and simple yield-based measures to metrics such as total farm productivity (CEEW, 2021) Millets Millets are a diverse group of small-seeded grasses culti- vated as food crops and are considered traditional food for more than half a billion people across Asia and Africa36. Some common types of millet grown in India include pearl millet (bajra), ﬁnger millet (ragi), foxtail millet, little mil- let, and kodo millet, among others.
