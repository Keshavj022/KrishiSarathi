The scientific cultivation practices of crops integrated with high yielding crop varieties along with dual purpose Vanaraja poultry and enough water supply have improved the farm productivity and sustainability. SUMMARY With the scientific interventions and adoption of IFS, all the farmers engaged in different models have been able to earn higher income and improve their standard of living. The integration of scientific methods of agricultural and horticultural crops cultivation supplemented with enough irrigation through water harvesting structures, introduction of new high yielding crop varieties as well as breeds of animals and poultry have improved the overall system productivity of the farms. The success of scientific IFS can be achieved with high efficiency through proper selection of farm components and allocation of farm resources. These farming models have proved to be of great success and have impacted many other farmers to take up the IFS model on their farms. *Corresponding author's e-mail: bijenyengkhom@gmail.com Indian Farming 44 August 2023 TERMS AND CONDITIONS RTGS/NEFT Payment Details: Journals/Magazines Name and Address of the Organization Project Director, DKMA Bank Name Canara Bank Bank Address Pusa, New Delhi 110012 IFSC Code CNRB0019029 MICR No. 110015391 Current Account No. 24133050000040 Research Journals • The Indian Journal of Agricultural Sciences (English monthly) • The Indian Journal of Animal Sciences (English monthly) ` 1,000 US$ 160 ` 3,000 US$ 450 ` 1,000 US$ 160 ` 3,000 US$ 450 For Individuals For Institutions Please accept my subscription amount of Rupees (`)/US Dollar ($) ....................................... for the Magazine(s)/Journal(s) tick (√) marked above.
