 The major outcomes of six workshops conducted in Punjab, UP, Gujarat, Bihar, Karnataka and WB were: i) Kufri Pukhraj, the high yielding, early maturing/bulking variety has emerged as the top variety in India, ii) Kufri Jyoti was the top variety in the states of Karnataka and West Bengal, while it seconded in the state of Punjab, iii) among processing varieties, Kufri Chipsona 1 was found to occupy good acreage in UP (9.81%); K. Chipsona-3 in UP (2.99%) and West Bengal (1.43%), iv) the number of varieties (>15) being grown in a states of UP & West Bengal was found directly proportional to irrigation facilities as well as the suitable climate, v) shrinking potato growing window due to rising temperatures in northern India, where crop is mostly grown was estimated to be number one problem. Sweet potato More than 21600 true seeds of orange fleshed sweet potato clones were having high dry matter and beta-carotene content sent from CIP-Lima, Peru to India (CTCRI) to be used for breeding program in India. The clones received in the form of seeds will be established, multiplied, evaluated/screened and then selected. The selected clones will be further subjected for screening in different seasons and before being used for breeding program in India. The complete exercise will be done by CTCRI in association with CIP in India. The clones are primarily orange fleshed. CIP is implementing a project on sweet potato called GAINS (Generating Advances in Incomes and Nutrition through Sweet potato) in Odisha supported under RKVY scheme through Directorate of Horticulture, Government of Odisha in 4 districts of the state. The area covered with improved varieties is 1350 ha over period of 3.5 years. The no. of farmers/ beneficiaries are around 4000 under the demonstration trials. The project sought to increase incomes and nutrition of farmers and bring awareness on the utilization of sweet potato. 2.iii Socio-economic impact/outcome Potato yy Eight varieties have been released by using CIP material as one of the parents to develop locally adapted table and processing varieties resistant to abiotic and biotic stresses. More than 120,000 ha area is planted under these varieties. The farmersâ€™ income was increased by using the processing varieties as alternate to table purpose. These varieties fetch higher than table purpose varieties. Late blight resistant variety has reduced cost of cultivation by reduced use of fungicide and higher productivity ICAR-CGIAR Agricultural Cooperation 73 CIP germplasm in varietal development in India Variety Type of variety Year of release CIP Parent K.
