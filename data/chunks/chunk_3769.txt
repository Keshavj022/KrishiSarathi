 This shall be a strategic and sustainable approach that offers a wide range of benefits to the region’s farmers, environment, and overall agricultural ecosystem. This integration creates a mutually beneficial relationship between beekeeping and agriculture. Honeybee’s diversity In the Northeastern hill region, five distinct honeybee species thrive. These include the small honeybee (Apis florea), rock bee (Apis dorsata), giant honeybee (Apis laboriosa), Asian honeybee (Apis cerana), and European honeybee (Apis mellifera). The first three species are wild insect pollinators and cannot be domesticated. In contrast, the latter two, Asian honeybee and European honeybee, are hive bees that can be managed in wooden hives. They are known for their industrious nature and adaptability to human interaction. These bees can be relocated as needed, exhibiting similar pollination behavior. The effectiveness of honeybee pollination depends on factors such as colony strength, colony number, shifting schedules, hive Naveen Kumar Patle1 and Meribeni Shitiri2 Prospects Training cum awareness on scientific beekeeping conducted in different states of Northeast region.

Within the Northeast region, a distinct subspecies of the Asian honeybee, Apis cerana himalaya, exists, differing from Apis cerana in the Northwest Himalayas and Apis cerana indica in South India. Furthermore, this subspecies exhibits three locally adapted populations or ecotypes corresponding to (1) the Naga and Mizo hills, (2) the Brahmaputra valley and Khasi hills, and (3) the foothills of the northeast Himalayas. These ecotypes vary in several biological and economic characteristics. The region’s abundant forests, agricultural resources, and horticultural crops make it an ideal candidate for beekeeping development. Integrating apiculture with agriculture in Northeast India offers numerous benefits, such as increased agricultural productivity, income diversification, environmental preservation, and sustainable farming practices. By endorsing and facilitating this integration, the region can harness beekeeping’s potential to enhance farmers’ livelihoods and contribute to agricultural sustainability and biodiversity conservation. Constraints in Beekeeping The Northeast region boasts immense potential for the advancement of beekeeping, thanks to its abundant natural resources, diverse landscapes, and rich cultural heritage. Despite the numerous opportunities, several challenges must be addressed, including: y Inadequate infrastructure for the production of genetically superior queen bees for beekeepers. y Limited technical expertise for effective bee colony management and maximizing honey production. y Insufficient awareness of the benefits of beekeeping for crop yield improvement through pollination. y The need for research and strategies for disease management and control in bee colonies.
