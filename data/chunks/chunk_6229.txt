 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Therapeutic efficacy Results obtained for treatment of diarrhoea using urhul-flower juice at Nagpur Veterinary College are presented in Table 1. Mixed infestation of Trichuris, Strongyle and Moneizia spp. was the cause of parasitic diarrhea. Complete recovery in the parasitic diarrhea group was achieved with standard therapy wirhin an average period of 1.5 days. The EPG was reduced from 1545 to 0 level in this group by day 6. Administration of urhul-flower juice reduced the dehydration and faecal consistency scores in both parasitic and non-parasitic diarrhoeic goats. However, there was no significant reduction in EPG count in parasitic diarrhoea following treatment with urhul flower. The results indicated that urhul flower juice has astingent effect and Table 2.

Serum biochemistry in treatment trial of urhul flower extract in clinical cases of diarrhoea in goats at CIRG can be used as supportive therapy. At CIRG, Makhdoom the clinical efficacy was assessed on the basis of revival of appetite, faecal consistency, dehydration status and changes in serum biochemical parameters. Overall therapeutic efficacy of the ITK was 66.7%. It was noted that the flower juice was moderately effective in bacterial diarrhoea in goats (Tables 2 and 3). Serum glucose and the sodium and potassium levels increased slightly after the treatment. Apparently the drug did not show any untoward effect, which was supported by biochemical parameters, viz. total protein, albumin, globulin, AST and creatinin concentration in serum (Table 4).
