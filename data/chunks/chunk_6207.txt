g/100 nl concentration did not show any effect in indirect method but reduced the 2 log titre of the virus in direct method. Further, one step growth studies are required to determine the stage at which these extracts are acting on GPV. Experiment BAV The trial was conducted in 20 clinical cases following outbreak of FMD in Tatisilvy and Jagnnathpur villages of Ranchi district. Most of these cases were 5-7 days old and had severe foot lesions, whereas some cases were in very early stages where only lameness and mouth lesions were observed. From fresh bark of jamun and babool the decoction was prepared by boiling 250 g bark of each tree in 1 litre of water till the volume became half. Thereafter, the decoction was filtered through muslin cloth. The foot lesions were washed with decoction and the farmers were advised to repeat the treatment in similar manner twice or thrice daily and restrict the grazing of animals and entry into the muddy places. The animals were examined for healing of the lesion after 7 days. The information to decide the recovery rate was collected from farmers. WBUAFS The trial was conducted in 10 clinical cases of FMD. The decoction was prepared by boiling 250 g bark of each of babool and jamun tree in 1 litre of water and die volume was reduced to half. It was filtered dirough muslin clodi and the foot lesions were washed witii the decoction twice daily for a maximum period of 10-12 days or till recovery. A group of 12 cattle was treated with the conventional therapy comprising antibiotic (Moxel @ 2-3 g intramuscularly daily for 4 days) and analgesic (Butagesic @ 10 ml intramuscularly daily for 3 days). The lesions were washed witii 1% potassium permanganate solution twice daily. Boroglycerine was applied on mouth lesions and Himax ointment on foot lesions after washing. The healing of lesions was assessed on die basis of colour of wound, quantity and type of exudation and pain on a scale of 0-4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION At BAU, the ITK, comprising application of babool and jamun bark on foot lesions dirice daily, showed good efficacy because die lesions healed rapidly witiiout development of maggot in FMD- affected catde and buffaloes. The average duration for the complete recovery was 22.5 days with a range of 7 to 29 days. However, wound healing occurred by day 10 in a majority of the cases (Table 2). Table 2.
