 Key traits in millet crops contributing for abiotic stress tolerance Morpho-physiological/ molecular traits Response to stress conditions References Earliness, plasticity to flower as per pattern of rainfall Early life cycle completion confers escape from water stress, temperature stress at critical growth stages Bidinger et al. (2007) Small leaf area, waxy leaves and better leaf venation Higher photo-assimilation, transpiration efficiency and water use efficiency Bandyopadhyay et al. (2017) Early, dense and deep root system with higher water uptake efficiency Avoids early drought and deep roots, helps in terminal drought Li and Brutnell (2011), Kumar and Panneerselvam (2014), Passot et al. (2016) Higher photosynthesis Due to C4 cycle and Kranz anatomy, millets have high water use efficiency under warm temperature, due to operation of MDH (Malate dehydrogenase) and PPDK (pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase) genes Sage and Zhu (2011) Enhanced level of secondary metabolites and osmolytes Higher levels of antioxidants and osmolytes Lata et al.

Photosynthetic efficiency of millet crops over other high input crops Character C4 Plant C3 Plant First CO2 acceptor Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase RuBP carboxylase Type of chloroplast Dimorphic chloroplast-Kranz anatomy present, two types of cells contain chloroplast (Mesophyll and Bundle Sheath) Monomorphic-only one type of cell contains chloroplast, Kranz anatomy absent Carbon pathway Both Calvin cycle (bundle sheath) and Hatch-Slack cycle (mesophyll) Calvin cycle in mesophyll cells Photorespiratory C2 cycle Absent Present CO2 compensation point 0–10 ppm 50–150 ppm CO2 assimilation rate in intense light 50–70 mg CO2/dm2/hr 15–35 mg CO2/dm2/hr Temperature optimum for photosynthesis and growth 30–45°C 10–25°C Transpiration ratio 500 (about 500 molecules of water are lost for every molecule of CO2 fixed by photosynthesis) 250 (about 500 molecules of water are lost for every molecule of CO2 fixed by photosynthesis) Water use efficiency 4.2–13.4 kg yield/ha/mm of rain 4.5–10.
