 Karnataka experiences a wide range of agro-climatic conditions, including arid lands and regions with abundant precipitation. Precipitation holds a pivotal role in agriculture production, with 66.48% of the agricultural land in the state relying on precipitation. The state predominantly receives 80.00% of its precipitation between June and September, primarily attributable to the southwest monsoon. Detailed information about Karnataka is outlined in Table 1. 3.2. Data sources and analysis The entire study is based on secondary data. District-wise data on the area and yield of major crops between 2004–2005 and 2018–2019 were extracted from the Statistical Abstract of Karnataka 2004–2005 and 2018–2019 (Department of Economics and Statistics, 2005, 2019). This study centered on 10 major crops: rice, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, tur, gram, groundnut, sunflower, and cotton, which were chosen to evaluate the spatio-temporal variation of agricultural efficiency. To unveil the spatio-temporal variation of agricultural efficiency at the district level between 2004–2005 and 2018–2019 in Karnataka, this study adopted agricultural efficiency method proposed by Bhatia (1967a). The procedural steps for this method are outlined as follows: 100 a ya r Y I Y = × , (1) where Iya is the yield index of crop a; Ya is the yield of the crop per unit area (kg/hm2); and Yr is the average yield of crop in the entire study area (kg/hm2). Then, agricultural efficiency index was calculated as follows: ya a yb b yn n i a b n I C I C I C E C C C × + × + + × = + + +   , (2) where Ei is the agricultural efficiency index; Iya, Iyb, , Iyn are the yield indices of various crops; n is the total number of crops; and Ca, Cb, , Cn are the percentage of each crop area occupying the total crop area (%). We calculated irrigation intensity (%) based on the research of Pattanayak and Mallick (2018) and Halder (2019) as follows: Net irrigated area Irrigation intensity= 100% Net crop area × . (3) Moreover, in order to visualize the relationship between agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity in Karnataka, we generated two residual maps for the periods of 2004–2005 and 2018–2019 by using the correlation coefficient technique, as detailed by Ohlan (2013), Islam and Siddiqui (2020), Majumder (2021), and Zeng et al.
