4 GHz/ 5GHz band) may also be used for transmitting the data from the smart phone to local hub/ loT Gateway, which will further transmit the data over cellular/ wireline network to the cloud/ server. -Interfaces, protocols for communications (a) LTE/5G connectivity (modem) (b) Wi-Fi NIC 4. Results of the use case (outcomes) The present loT-based irrigation system comprises soil moisture sensors that can acquire field data in real-time and act according to that. The Al/loT based precision irrigation system can give an optimal solution for autonomous agricultural operations for precision, economics, reduced human struggle, and environment protection. The moisture sensor sends the signal to the ESP 32's configured Wi-Fi module, which triggers the water pump and irrigates the field using the smartphone or computer application if the moisture level falls below the pre- defined value and prediction of occurrence of rainfall is low. The measured variables were continuously recorded automatically and sent to the ThinkSpeak cloud based server. The developed data acquisition unit was switched ON and staked in the agriculture field TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 123 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 124 During the growing season of the sweet corn crops the water depths applied (mm) in IoT- based and ETc-based drip irrigation was compared at 10-day intervals. The first row of Table 1 shows 20 mm of irrigation applied immediately after planting to bring the soil to its capacity. Drip irrigation with 100% ETC had the highest amount of water applied, followed by drip irrigation with 100% FC and 80% FC with IoT. In total, 443.7 mm, 393.6 mm, and 356.2 mm of irrigation were applied by groundwater (as blue water) under 100 % ETc-based drip irrigation, 100% FC IoT-based drip irrigation, and 80% FC IoT-based drip irrigation, respectively. During the growing season, irrigation water applied to the ETc-based treatments increased exponentially with ETO. Compared to ETC 100% drip irrigation, IoT-based drip irrigation 100% FC and 80% FC used 12.7% and 24.5% less irrigation water, respectively.
