Pa−1 [42], pro­ fenofos is considered as moderately volatile. However, laboratory ex­ periments conducted at 20 ◦C showed rapid profenofos volatilisation from water, with half-life of 6.3 ± 3 d, suggesting volatilisation as a major dissipation route. 3.2.2. Hydrolysis Volatilization control experiments conducted in sealed vials confirmed that abiotic hydrolysis was not a significant process at pH = 7 and T = 20 ◦C, over the 35 days of experiment. Since hydrolysis may depend on the prevailing pH conditions in the environment, further investigations were conducted to assess the effect of pH and temperature on profenofos hydrolysis. Raising the temperature to 60 ◦C led to sub­ stantial and rapid hydrolysis at pH = 7 (T1/2 = 13.9 ± 0.9 h) in sealed vials. Such temperature conditions significantly accelerated the hydro­ lysis at pH = 9 with a T1/2 = 1.8 ± 0.4 h, resulting in over 96 % of profenofos degradation within the 9 h incubation period. In contrast, at pH 3, profenofos dissipation was negligible (< 5 %) within the same period. This pH dependence aligns with previous studies, which showed increasing profenofos hydrolysis from pH 5–9 in water [43]. 3.2.3. Photolysis Photolysis experiments showed rapid dissipation of profenofos under UV light (254 nm) at 20 ◦C, with T1/2 ranging from 2.8 to 3.5 h across pH values from 3 to 9. In contrast, under simulated sunlight (Xe lamp) at pH 7 and T◦= 45 ◦C, less than 50 % of degradation was observed after 10 days of irradiation. This indicates that profenofos is not highly sen­ sitive to photolysis under these conditions. The sensitivity of profenofos to UV photolysis at environmental pH was previously predicted by its relatively high molar extinction coefficient (ε = 460 M−1.cm−1 at 254 nm) [44]. Leveraging this property, several studies have demon­ strated the potential of UV-based solutions for remediating profenofos in drinking water [45]. 3.2.4. Soil dissipation Dissipation of profenofos in both biotic and heat-treated laboratory soil experiments was rapid, with T1/2 = 1.4 ± 0.6 d and 1.1 ± 0.2 d respectively (Table 1), suggesting abiotic dissipation of profenofos under both soil conditions. With a soil pH range of 7.1–7.9 (Table S-2), abiotic hydrolysis can be excluded as a major pathway for the dissipa­ tion of profenofos. Nonetheless, mineral surfaces have been hypoth­ esised to significantly accelerate hydrolysis kinetics (T₁/₂ < 10 d) for some OPs and carbamate pesticides, which otherwise exhibit slow hy­ drolysis rates in aqueous solutions (T1/2 > 1 y) [46]. However, the soil dissipation kinetics of profenofos were found to be in the same order of magnitude as those measured in the water volatilisation experiment (T₁/₂ = 6.3 ± 3.0 days at 20 ◦C), confirming that volatilisation might be a dominant process driving profenofos dissipation in soil.
