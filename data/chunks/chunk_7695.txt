 Economic analysis indicated a net profit of ` 800–900 from a pair of birds of this cross. Two-way chicken cross at farmer’s doorstep: Multi- coloured synthetic broiler lines (PB-1, PB-2 and control) were maintained and evaluated. The body weight, shank length and FCR at 5 weeks were 841.6 g, 74.1 mm and 2.2, respectively, in PB-1 line. In broiler control population (G-16), the production traits were similar to those observed in previous generation. In PB-2 population (S-27 generation), the egg production and egg weight at 40 weeks were 65.0 and 59.4 g, respectively. The body weight at 5 weeks of age showed an improvement over the previous generation. The breeding value of the population indicated that the selection was effective for traits under selection. The body weight at 5 weeks was 801.6 and 640.5 g, respectively, in naked neck and dwarf populations. Layer lines (IWH, IWI, IWK, IWD, IWF and control) were maintained and evaluated. The egg production increased in all the selected lines over the previous generation. past 12/13 generations was 30.4 g in PB-1 and 20.4 g in PB-2. At Ludhiana centre, the body weight of native germplasm was 765 g at 8 weeks, while the egg production in the PB-2 × Desi cross was 55.6 eggs in the field.

Body weight of cross (CSML × Desi) was 1,368 g at 8 weeks. The genetic response for 5-week body weight was 15.1 and 15.0 g in CSML and CSFL, respectively. At Bhubaneswar centre, the body weight of native chicken (Hansli) was 587 g at 8 weeks and the egg production up to 40 weeks was 23.1. In the purelines, the body weight at 5 weeks was 1,025 and 1,129 g in CSFL and CSML lines, respectively, which were higher than in the previous generation. At Tripura centre, the body weight at 8 weeks was 306.5, 495, 1,102 and 512.9 g in Tripura black, Dahlem Red, color broiler dam line and BN cross, respectively.
