 To induce viviparity at exact time after flowering, panicles of each variety were tagged according to the flowering date. The viviparous germination percentage observed in field and lab protocols at 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 days after flowering was almost similar. Almost all the viviparous genotypes showed viviparity within 6 days after incubation both in the field and laboratory. A wide variability was observed in viviparous germination at different days after flowering in different rice genotypes. The results from field and laboratory showed almost similar viviparity. Laboratory protocol compared to field protocol is very convenient especially when screening large number of genotypes, because field protocol requires inducement of lodging, besides maintaining water level in the field so that panicles are always immersed in water for evaluating vivipary and daily counting of viviparous grains in the paddy field is also difficult. Hence to screen large number of genotypes for vivipary, laboratory method can be an efficient method considering the correlation with field observation data, outstanding genotypic difference and convenience of testing. Mutants identified: Mutants of BPT 5204 having robust root system architecture, early seedling vigour index, and higher yield under limiting water conditions have been identified viz., TI 128, TI 124, TI 112, TI 3, TI 87 and TI 17. The lines are suitable for the dry direct seeded method of establishment with an aerobic system of cultivation management practice. The genomes of an elite rice restorer line KMR3 (salinity-sensitive) and its salinity tolerant introgression line IL50-13, a popular variety of coastal West Bengal, India, were sequenced. Genes showing polymorphism Matrix plot showing the similarity in viviparous germination between the field and lab protocols tested for evaluating 26 diverse genotypes for vivipary.

Draft Genome of Yellow Stem-borer Scirpophaga incertulas (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) A draft genome of an agriculturally important pest with 46,057 genes and estimated size of 308 Mb has been generated. It provides molecular insights into its biology, development and specificity towards rice for infestation (https://www.mdpi.com/2075- 4450/12/6/563). Seed Production Breeder seed production: During 2021-22, total breeder seed production in field crops was 1,01,617.5 q against the indent of 77,260.1 q. The major share in total breeder seed production belongs to cereal crops, i.e. 52,828.6 q against indent of 39,071.6 q. Under pulse crops a total of Crop Improvement between the two genomes were considered as sequence- based new candidates derived from Oryza rufipogon for conferring high yield and salinity tolerance in IL50-13 for further functional studies. icar annual report 2022-23 59 13,790.3 q breeder seed was produced against the indent of 11,700.6 q. In oilseeds, total breeder seed production was 33,936.
