 The total residue produced during harvesting or processing can be termed as the gross crop residue, while the residue left after any traditional uses (like cattle bedding, cattle feed, organic fertilizer, cooking, and heating fuel) is called surplus crop residue. Depending on its chemical properties, surplus crop residue from any crop can be useful for the bioenergy generation process. The determination of crop residue potentials for the 28 crops mentioned above using standard procedures is discussed further below (Hiloidhari et al., 2014; Hiloidhari and Baruah, 2011). 2.2.1. Gross crop residue estimation In this study, estimation is done on a region (state/UT) wise basis. The gross crop residue of a crop is mainly dependent on two parameters, viz. (i) the production value of the crop and (ii) the RPR value of the crop. The production data of a crop can be directly found in sources. The total or gross residue has been estimated with Eqs. (1)–(4). GR(m, n) = P(m, n) × RPR(m) (1) GRstate(n) = 43 ∑ m=1 GR(m, n) (2) GRnational(m) = 36 ∑ n=1 GRstate(m, n) (3) GRIndia = 36 ∑ n=1 GRstate(n) = 43 ∑ m=1 GRnational(m) (4) Where, GR (m,n) is the gross residue potential for m crop residue in nth state/UT, GRstate (n) is the state/UT level gross residue potential for 43 crop residues in nth state/UT, GRnational is the gross national residue potential of m crop residue, GRIndia is the total gross residue potential of India, from 43 crop residues generated in 36 regions (states/UT’s). 2.2.2. Surplus crop residue estimation The surplus crop residue amount has been estimated using surplus residue fraction (SRF) data for each crop residue type, as shown in Eqs. (5)–(8). SR(m, n) = GR(m, n) × SRF(m) (5) SRstate(n) = 43 ∑ m=1 SR(m, n) (6) SRnational(m) = 36 ∑ n=1 SRstate(m, n) (7) SRIndia= 36 ∑ n=1 SRstate(n) = 43 ∑ m=1 SRnational(m) (8) Where, SR (m,n) is the surplus crop residue potential for m crop residue in nth state/UT, SRstate (n) is the state/UT level surplus residue potential for 43 crop residues in nth state/UT, SRnational is the surplus national residue potential of m crop residue, SRIndia is the total surplus residue potential of India, from 43 crop residues generated in 36 regions (states/UT’s). 2.3. Estimation of bioenergy potential The crop residue bioenergy potential has been estimated using Eqs. (9)–(12). E(m, n) = SR(m, n) × HV(m) (9) Estate(n) = 43 ∑ m=1 E(m, n) (10) 3774 T.J. Deka, A.I.
