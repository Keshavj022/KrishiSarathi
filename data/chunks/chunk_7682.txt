 CROP IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 54 produced against the targets of 193.5 and 5.1 lakh, respectively. HORTICULTURE Mango: Arka Suprabhath (H 14) is a double cross hybrid between Amrapali (Dashehari × Neelum) × Arka Anmol (Alphonso × Janardhan Pasand). It bears in bunches with 35–40 kg/tree potential fruit yield (after 4 years of planting). Fruit weight ranges from 250–300 g, deep orange pulp of 70% recovery and 22°B TSS, and 8–10 days shelf life at room temperature. Banana and plantains: One promising cooking banana (plantain) hybrid (NCR 17) for higher yield (25 kg) was developed. Three banana varieties, namely Kaveri Kanya, Kaveri Haritha and Kaveri Saba were recommended for release and notification by the Central Sub- Committee on Crop Standards, Notification and Release of Varieties for Horticultural Crops, Government of India. Kaveri Kanya is an introduced accession (FHIA 03) with medium tall (2.4 to 2.7 m) and robust pseudostem (80–95 cm girth) and yields 25 kg bunches. Kaveri Haritha is a clonal selection from Bangrier and released for culinary purpose. It has stable yield in both main and two ratoon crops (25 kg/ bunch). Kaveri Saba is a dual purpose variety, tolerant to deficit soil moisture stress and saline sodic soils. Grapes: Evaluation of Charark (Chardonnay × Arkavati) series of wine hybrids revealed all wines to be within the category of very dried wines and had higher alcohol. Of the 90 hybrid progenies of grapes, 19 were observed resistant to downy mildew (UPOV rating 1– 3). Hybrid progenies H128.23 and H52.23 were observed promising for naturally loose bunches (<2 berries/cm spacing), progeny H95.24 for bold berries (diameter 19 mm) and Hybrid H52.23 for rudimentary seeds and rose colour berries. Manjari Shyama is a hybrid (Black Champa × Thompson Seedless) with black, crunchy and bold berries identified for table purpose. Litchi: Two promising genetic stocks of litchi, viz. NRCL-29 and NRCL-85 were identified. NRCL-29 has precocious bearing (flowering in third year of planting) and fruit pericarp contains high anthocyanins (94.35 mg/ 100 g). NRCL-85 is a heavy bearer (30–40 fruits/cluster) and fruits are tolerant to cracking. Guava: Arka Kiran, a hybrid (Kamsari, IC395207 × Purple Local, IC 20455), has round and medium size fruits (170–180 g), dark red pulp with medium soft seeds (9–10 kg/cm 2) and high lycopene (7 to 7.14 mg/100 g pulp). Jamun: CISH Jamwant, an elite and bold (24.05 g), oblong, deep purple jamun was identified. Fruits are 3.9 cm long with 3.03 cm diameter, 92.26% pulp, 16 to 17 brix and more pulp: seed ratio (90–92%). It has relatively high ascorbic acid (49.88 mg/100 g) and total antioxidant value (38.30 mg AEAC/g). At 10 years of age, it yields 80–90 kg fruits/tree. Wood apple: Thar Gaurav is precocious (bearing in 4th year), large fruit (452.25 g), high yielding (124.36 kg/tree) under rain-fed conditions of western India. Fruits are rich in pectin (1.76%) and protein (pulp 18.
