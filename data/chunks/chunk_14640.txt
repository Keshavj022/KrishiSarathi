 The samples once brought to the laboratory were shade dried aseptically and stored in a cold room (4 C) until further processing. 2.2. Isolation of actinomycetes from soil A selective media containing basal nutrients and antibiotics was used for the isolation of Streptomyces. Starch casein agar (SCA) con- taining soluble starch 10 gL-1, casein 0.3 gL-1, KNO3 2.0 gL-1, MgSO47H2O 0.05 gL-1, K2HPO4 2.0 gL-1, NaCl 2.0 gL-1, CaCO3 0.02 gL-1, FeSO47H2O 0.01 gL-1 and Agar 20.0 gL-1 supplemented with cycloheximide (50 mg/L), nystatin (50 mg/L) and rifampicin (50 mg/L) was used as the selective media (Nolan and Cross, 1988). The pH of the media was adjusted to 7. Standard serial dilu- tion and plating method was followed to isolate Streptomyces. Ali- quots (100 lL) of dilutions, 1/1000 and 1/10000 were plated on the selective media and incubated at 30 ± 1 C for 7–10 days. Plates were observed regularly for the growth of the actinomycetes pop- ulation. Different morphotypes from each of the samples were picked and puriﬁed in the selective media. The isolates were then stored as glycerol stocks (20 %) at 80 C and slants at 4 C until further study. 2.3. DNA isolation and 16S rRNA gene sequence ampliﬁcation Total DNA was extracted from fully grown actinomycetes cul- tures using Nucleo-pore gDNA Fungal Bacterial Mini Kit employing the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of DNA was checked and ensured both by gel electrophoresis and nanodrop. Universal pri- mers pA (AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and pH (AAGGAGGTGATC- CAGCCGCA) were used for the ampliﬁcation of the 16S rRNA gene. The PCR reactions were carried out in a peqSTAR thermal cycler by following the protocols of Kumar et al. (2014) with slight modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, the reactions were carried out in 25 lL vol- ume comprising 12.5 lL Go Taq green Master Mix 2X (Promega, USA), 100 ng of primers (pA and pH), 50 ng DNA template and nuclease free water to adjust the volume. PCR conditions used were as follows; initial denaturation-95 C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation-95 C for 30 s, annealing-52 C for 40 s and extension-72 C for 60 s; and a ﬁnal extension at 72 C for 10 min. The ampliﬁed PCR products were visualized in 1.5 % agar- ose gel electrophoresis (stained with ethidium bromide) using a gel documentation system (Bio Rad, USA). 2.4. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis PCR products were puriﬁed using Gene JET PCR Puriﬁcation Kit (Thermo Fisher, USA) and sequenced using the primer 1100R (GGGTTGCGCTCGTTG) (Engelbrektson et al., 2010) at GeneMatrix sequencing facility by following sanger dideoxy sequencing method in an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer. Resultant sequences were then quality ﬁltered in FinchTV and trimmed for better qual- ity sequences (Stucky, 2012). Quality ensured sequences were then used to run a BLAST search against 16S rRNA gene sequences of type species available in EZ Biocloud to identify the isolates (https://www.ezbiocloud.net).
