 yy Trash mulching to avoid incidence of early shoot borer de-trashing during 150th and 210th days of crop to reduce internode borer incidence. Sesame yy Recommended varieties are Co-1, Paiyur-1, VRI-1, VRI-2, TMV-7, VRI 3. yy Appropriate sowing time is Second fortnight of May to Second fortnight of June. yy Seed treatment with Trichoderma @4g/kg of seed, Bacillus subtilis @ 10 g/Kg seed or Bacillus subtilis @ 210 g/Kg seed or NSKE 4% avoid pest and disease incidence. yy To manage root rot and collar rot: Seed treatment with T. asperellum @ 4 g/kg of seed and B. subtilis @ 10 g/kg seed. yy To manage manganese deficiency and increase seed yield soil application of MnSO4 @ 10 kg/ha is recommended. yy Spray 5%NSKE to manage sucking pest complex. yy Intercropping of Sesamum+Redgram (6:1) will give additional net returns Tomato yy High yielding varieties PKM 1, CTH 1 and Paiyur 1 and hybrids COTH 2 and COTH 3 can be used for Kharif season. The farmers can use private varieties for cultivation. The protray nursery seedlings should be used to get development in the main field. The coir pith used to raise seedlings may be enriched with Bacillus subtilis and T. asperellum to give protection against diseases in the nursery and main field. 208 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy Foliar spraying of ZnSO4 @ 0.5 per cent thrice at 10 days interval from 40 days after planting. yy In the nematode affected areas, the farmers should grow marigold as intercrop at 8:1 ratio. In these areas the bio-inoculants such as Bacillus subtilis, T. asperellum and Purpureocillium lilacinum @ 2Kg/ ac along with neem cake or FYM either at the time of planting or 15-30 days after planting. yy To manage Tomato pin worm, the practices such as placing pheromone traps @ 40 nos./ha, border crop with pulses or combination to encourage natural enemies, release of Trichogramma pritiosum @ 40,000/acre at weekly intervals may be practiced. If more pinworm incidence is noticed azadirachtin 1.0% EC (10000 ppm) 2.0 ml/ l or indoxacarb 14.5 SC 8 ml/10 l. or chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC 3.0 ml/10 lit or emamectin benzoate 5SG @ 4 g/10 lit or spinetoram 11.7 SC @ 1.0 ml/l or spinosad 45 SC @ 3.2 ml /10 l may be sprayed to manage the pin worm menace. yy Leaf curl and tomato spotted wilt virus will be the major problems for the farmers. To manage the vector spraying of thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 0.6 g/l or imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 0.6 ml/l can be done. yy Installation of yellow sticky traps @ 50 Nos/ha and spraying of Thiamethoxam 70 WS 6ml/10 lit is recommended to control serpentine leaf miner, aphid, thrips and whitefly incidence. yy Spraying of zineb or mancozeb @ 2 g/l for managing leaf spot disease. Small Onion yy Small onion sowing begins in May â€“June 2020. So the farmers are advised to do seed bulb treatment before sowing yy Varieties such as CO (On) 5 and CO 6 is recommended for sowing during kharif season. yy High yielding varieties CO (On) 5 can be used for Kharif season.
