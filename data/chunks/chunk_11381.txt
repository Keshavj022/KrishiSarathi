 Use total quantity of N in 2-3 split doses and total quantity of P & K as basal dose. Wheat A major Rabi cereal cultivated almost in all parts of the state & for higher yield potential it requires sandy loam and loam, fertile and higher WHC soils under irrigated situations. In Rajasthan state it is mainly cultivated under irrigated conditions. Improved varieties: Raj-1482, Raj-3765, Raj-3777, Raj-4037, Raj- 4120, Raj-4079, Raj-4238, KRL-210, BWD-303, DWD-48 (Bio fortified variety). ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 90 Seed Rate- 100-120 kg/ha. Sowing Time: November Manure and Fertilizers: Apply 8-10 ton well decomposed FYM/ ha, if available and mix properly in the soil before sowing. Use chemical fertilizers as per soil testing report recommendations & if report is not available than apply 120 Kg N, 60 Kg P & 40 Kg potash/ha. In zinc deficient areas apply 25 kg Zinc Sulphate /ha. Use total quantity of N in 2-3 split doses and total quantity of P & K as basal dose. To manage fungal diseases, treat the seed with Vitavax power @ 2 g/kg seed and for termite control with Fipronil 5 SC @ 8 ml/kg seed. Fenugreek (Methi) A Rabi season seed spice crop & cultivated in many districts of the state. Soil & climatic conditions of the state are favourable for its better growth & higher yield. Being a leguminous seed spice crop, it improves soil fertility also. Improved varieties: RMt-1, RMt-305, AFg-1, Afg-3 Sowing Time: 2nd fortnight of October month. Seed Rate: 20-25 kg/ha Manure & fertilizers: should be applied as per soil testing report & if soil testing report is not available than apply 8-10 ton well decomposed FYM/ha, if available and mix properly in the soil before sowing. Use chemical fertilizers @ 20 Kg N, 40 Kg P & 250 Kg gypsum/ha. In zinc deficient areas apply 25 kg Zinc Sulphate / ha. Use total quantity of N in 2 split doses and total quantity of P & K as basal dose. Treat the seed with Carbendezim 50WP @ 2 g/Kg seed for control of fungal diseases and followed by insecticide & Rhizobium culture. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 91 Other activities to be performed: To achieve higher water use efficiency (WUE) of available irrigation water, especially in canal area, land should be levelled with Laser Land Leveller before sowing of Rabi season crops. Collect, Harvest & Conserve maximum rainwater as much as possible in Farm Pond or Plastic based water pond and minimize the losses of conserved rainwater for life saving irrigation on different critical stages during moisture deficit conditions, to achieve higher productivity level. As per availability of resources, prepare proper work plan for sustainable farming/ organic farming/ Paramparagat Krishi in Rabi season and for this nearby KVK may help you in providing proper advisory and guidance. Adopt appropriate IFS Models as per availability of different resources, infrastructure, and facilities on their farm.
