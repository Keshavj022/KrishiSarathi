 In Gurgaon test, another cross the Caribro-Dhanraj from CARI, recorded body weights, 1,361 g and 1,595 g at 6 and 7 weeks of age, respectively, with the corresponding feed efficiency of 2.15 and 2.33. The margin of receipts was Rs 24.25 and Rs 25.95 at both the ages. In the same test, the PAU cross recorded 1,430 g and 1,900 g at 6 and 7 weeks, with feed conversion of 1.65 and 1.78, for both periods. Rural Poultry The introduction of ‘Rural Poultry’ component in the later part of IX plan period at the ICAR Research Complex, Agartala, was intended to field test the germplasm developed by the PD on Poultry, for rural farming under scavenging conditions. Vanaraja dual purpose germplasm developed by the PD on Poultry, Hyderabad, and Giriraja from UAS, Bangalore, were tested both on farm at Agartala centre, and at household level in the hilly tracks. Both the varieties adapted well to the free-range scavenging situation. Improvement of male and female lines for production of rural germplasm: At the PDP, Hyderabad, the male line is used to produce the terminal cross, Vanaraja. PERFORMANCE OF CARI-DEBENDRA CARI Debendra, a dual-purpose breed cross showed an average fertility of 85.19%, while the hatchability on fertile eggs transferred basis was 51.69%. The body weights at 6, 8 and 10 weeks of age in the combined sexes were 730.95, 1,154.17 and 1,452.74 g, respectively. The average gain in body weight between different age groups, viz. 6 to 8 weeks; 8 to 10 weeks and 6 to 10 weeks,was 517.86, 404.88 and 922.74 g, respectively; and average feed consumed per bird during the afore-mentioned period was 1,024, 1,119 and 2,143 g, respectively; and feed conversion rates were 1.98, 2.76 and 2.32, respectively. The CARI- Debendra pullets matured at an average age of 139.46 days. The mean egg weight was 53.42 and 60.35 g at 28 and 40 week of age, respectively, with the egg production performance of 80.18 eggs up to 40-week of age. LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 107 Genetic parameters showed sufficient scope for improvement and, intense selection was imposed for shank length and antibody titre but not on body weight. Breeders in S 3 generation matured 12 days earlier with a reduction in egg weight by 1–2 g over S 2. The multi-colour female line is being improved using family index and it is in S 2 generation. Due weightage was given for juvenile body weight, shank length, antibody titers and plumage colour in selection at 6 weeks of age and a desirable blend of these traits was achieved in the terminal cross for efficient rural adaptation. In S 2 generation, 4 and 6-week body weight were, respectively, 357 g and 699 g in males and 328 g and 626 g in females. The shank length and antibody titers at 6 weeks of age in males were 3.04 inches and 5.21 log2, respectively, and in females the same were 2.88 inches and 5.75 log2.
