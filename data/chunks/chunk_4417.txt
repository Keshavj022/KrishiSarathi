 Flowers are 5–7 cm wide, which are arranged in clusters of 1–12 on 1–2 year old branches that have shed their leaves. Fruits belong to the category of berries, which are pears or cashew apple shaped and fleshy. The fruits are 5–8 cm wide and 6–8 cm long, dark red with white or pink streaks, but the colour can also be whitish or pinkish. Each fruit contains 1 round, brown seed (2.5–3.5 cm wide), which mature in two months after flowering. Propagation is generally by seeds, which are poly- embryonic, containing 3–4 embryos. Seeds germinate in 12-15 days, and 3-4 epicotyls emerge from each seed. The first two leaves are initially light brown in colour and turn into parrot green colour after a week. One of these seedlings is from fertilization and the other seedlings are identical cones of the mother tree. The seedling which germinates from the fertilised embryo, is generally less vigorous while the other seedlings are vigorous. Hence, it is desirable to keep it on the vigorous plant and prune the remaining plants to ensure true qualities of the mother tree. It is also possible to separate all the seedlings to produce more seedlings, preferably within a week after germination. Grafting, budding, stem cutting and air- layering are also successful. It is desirable to maintain the seedlings for 5-6 months in the nursery before planting in the field. A spacing of 6-8 m can be provided in commercial orchards. The plants grow fairly fast with thin side branches, and start flowering in 3-4 years. New vegetative flushes emerge 3-4 times a year and the flowering flushes Malay rose apple trees and leaves Indian Horticulture 50 emerge simultaneously from the dormant axillary buds on matured stems. Flowering will be profuse and as the stamens fall on the ground, the canopy area under the tree looks like a purplish-red carpet. Only a small number of flowers (less than 1%) set into fruits, which are glossy, crowned by the incurved non-fleshy calyx segments. The fruit turns slightly soft on ripening, which is an indication for harvesting. The colour of the fruits vary from white to dark pink, purple-red or white with red streaks. The flesh is 0.5-2.5 cm thick, spongy, juicy, white and fragrant, with a brown seed. Seeds have a very short life of 2 weeks for sowing. Nutritive value and uses Rose apple fruit is delicious, mildly sour in taste and with a distinct sweet flavour. It can be consumed as fresh fruits or processed into juice, squash, jam, sauce, preserves and wine. The slightly unripe fruits are used for making jelly and pickles. The fruit is very nutritious, as presented in the table below.
