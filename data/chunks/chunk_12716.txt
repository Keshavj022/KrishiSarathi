 These farmers traditionally rely on common lands and other common resources to meet out a significant portion of green fodder requirements for their livestock. There are 1.10 lakhs ha of common grazing lands in the State that are under various stages of degradation and are not producing optimum quantities of fodder due to various reasons. The deficit in green fodder production can be addressed efficiently by adopting a community 520 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 centric approach by undertaking fodder production in the common property lands which are in various stages of degradation. These lands need to be converted into an area suitable for fodder cultivation so that green fodder can be made available at the village level throughout the year. It is proposed to establish Fodder Production unit in meikkal poromboke lands in all districts of the State by providing infrastructure facilities such as borewell, open wells, farm ponds, percolation ponds, pipelines, ground level reservoir, overhead tanks, fencing, farm roads, silage pits, etc. Strengthening of infrastructure for milk processing and dairy development In Tamil Nadu, milk contributes more than 43 per cent share in the value of output from livestock sector (Policy note on Diary development, Govt. of Tamil Nadu). There are 17 milk processing units run by Milk Producer’s Unions and 12,105 Primary Milk Producer’s Co- operative Societies in the State. Out of 23.01 lakh members in the Milk Producer’s Co-operative Societies, about 4.60 lakhs members are regularly supplying milk to the Milk Producer’s Co- operative Societies. The Milk Producer’s Unions have milk processing capacity of 24.07 lakhs litre/day. Besides, there are 35 chilling centres and 299 Bulk Milk Coolers (BMC) run by the Societies. On an average about 9.78 lakhs litre/day of milk has been sold by the Co-operative Societies. There are also 42 private diaries functioning in the tate. Some of the action plans suggested to achieve higher and quality milk production are:   Strengthening of milk testing at village level for clean milk production.   Strengthening of dairy plants functioning under Co-operative sector through capacity expansion.   Enabling supply of clean, hygienic milk and milk products.   Providing veterinary health cover, implementation of AI program, supply of cattle feed, fodder and insurance cover to animals.   Computerization of dairy activities at various levels to improve the efficiency and ensure more transparency in milk handling.   Training to farmers, provision of antiseptic chemicals and utensils, strengthening of lab at Union dairies and chilling cenres and installation of Bulk Milk Coolers (BMC) at societies.
