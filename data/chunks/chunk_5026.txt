 The easy availability of neem leaves and chilli was found the most important factor of its use in storage of pulse grains/seeds. Cooking quality of the pulses grains was highest when it was stored using mustard oil (Fig. 1) and chilli (Fig. 2). It was also reported that chilli- treated seeds cause irritation while handling. Mustard oil is applied @ 0.5 l/q seed or grain  GRAIN/SEED STORAGE containers. Storing more quantity of produce, easy availability and ease in handling were important criteria in favour of gunny bags (Table2). Earthen pots, tin or plastic containers were reported for storing small quantities specifically that of seeds. From discussion with practioners it was found that layer of sand at the bottom and top of the container was not in the practice. The mouth of gunny bags was normally stitched, whereas that of earthen pot, metal bins, tin or plastic container was covered with a lid. Straw is sometimes used Fig. 1. Mixing chillies in greengram for storage and mixed thoroughly, whereas Neem leaves, chilli or begunia leaves are mixed with the produce before keeping it in the containers. These are properly dried before mixing with grains or seeds. Experiment Efficacy of containers Plastic containers recorded the highest average score of 8.61, followed by gunny bags (7.56) and earthen pots (7.14). However, use of gunny bags was reported to be the most popular of all the Fig. 2. Mustard oil treated greengram ready to store in gunny bag Table 2.

Laboratory studies: Samples of already stored greengram seeds at the farmers’ level were collected from the Benakunda village twice and were analysed for seed quality.
