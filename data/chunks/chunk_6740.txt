 Differential accumulation patterns and content of L-Dopa were observed in different tissues, which also varied among genotypes. The content of L-Dopa (on fresh weight basis) was found to be higher in flowers (2.13–4.42%) and young leaves (3.15–4.37%), followed by fully grown leaves (0.54–1.33%) and immature pod (0.51–1.27%). The least content was observed in matured pod tissues, i.e. 0.22 to 0.39%. Due to the presence of higher amount of L-Dopa, the immature leaf and flowers can be used as an alternative source. Development of a rapid single kernel screening method for preliminary estimation of amylose in maize: The development of low glycaemic index maize varieties requires screening of a large number of inbreds. Conventional methods of amylose estimation are time consuming. A simple and rapid screening method has been designed for amylose estimation in maize kernels, which is based on the principle of amylose-iodine complex formation. This method involves cutting of maize kernel longitudinally to expose the endosperm, followed by treatment with optimized potassium iodide:iodine (2:1) solution on the cut end and recording the time involved for maximum colouration. It was observed that time taken for iodine to reach its maximum colouration had an inverse relation to the amylose content in maize kernel. The method was validated in a large set of maize samples with varied amylose content and automation was done with the use of AlphaView SA Comparison of L-Dopa content in various plant tissues of faba bean. Estimation by HPLC showed higher L-Dopa content in flowers. Standard Flower Immature leaf Immature pod Mature leaf Mature pod Crop Improvement qPCR validation of RNA-seq data, graphs showing the correlation of log 2 fold change of RFOs related genes (G1: AhGolS4; G2: AhGolS6; G3: AhRS14; G4: AhRS4; G5: AhRS6; G6: AhRS8; G7: AhRS3; and G8: AhSS7) to that of RNA-seq data. The graph also depicts the differential gene expression in contrasting genotypes at immature seed stage (S1) and matured seed stage (S2) (A: TG37A (S2 vs S1); B: GG7 (S2 vs S1); C: Girnar2 (S2 vs S1); D: TG37A vs GG7 (S1); E: TG37A vs GG7 (S2); F: TG37A vs Girnar2 (S1); G: TG37A vs Girnar2 (S2); H: Girnar2 vs GG7 (S1) and I: Girnar2 vs GG7 (S2). icar annual report 2022-23 53 software. The proposed method is a rapid and simple for screening of maize kernels with varied amylose amounts, and gets completed in 1 min, making it suitable for large- scale screening of maize germplasm including mutants and wild types. Meta-QTL analysis for fungal disease resistance in maize and identification of the inherent mechanistic pathways: An extensive literature search was conducted to find published QTL mapping studies for 19 fungal diseases of maize.
