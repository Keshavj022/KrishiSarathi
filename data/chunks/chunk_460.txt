 However, by adopting alternative practices such as delayed or split-dose N applications, or preferably relying on slow-release nitrogen sources and rich soil organic matter for the majority of the crop’s N requirements, these weeds can potentially be subdued in their competitive vigour. • Irrigation management: Unlike sprinkler or flood irrigation, where water and nutrients are distributed more evenly across the entire field, drip irrigation supply water and nutrient near crop root zone. Consequently, the soil between the rows receives minimal moisture and nutrients, creating an unfavourable environment for weed proliferation. This restricted supply effectively hampers weed growth and helps maintain a weed-free zone between the crop rows. Subsurface drip irrigation, which minimizes soil surface wetting, plays a crucial role in inhibiting weed germination and growth. By limiting the availability of moisture to the soil surface, this irrigation method significantly curtails weed establishment. • Crop rotation: Crop rotation is an integral component of an integrated weed management system, offering an efficient strategy to eliminate crop associated weeds. By incorporating this approach, farmers can alternate the use of herbicides with diverse modes of action, thereby preventing or delaying the onset of herbicide resistance. • Optimum sowing time: Maize sowing in second fortnight of June with optimum seed rate of 20 kg/ha gives an edge over weeds. • Stale seed bed techniques: Here, before sowing of maize, a light irrigation is given to stimulate the germination and growth of weeds. Thereafter, initial flush of weeds is removed either mechanically through shallow tillage or by chemical means. By employing the stale seed bed technique, farmers can effectively reduce the weed seed bank, giving the crop a competitive advantage and reducing the need for subsequent weed control measures throughout the growing season. • Mulching: Mulching is a crucial technology extensively employed in orchards and agricultural systems for soil and moisture conservation. Additionally, mulching plays a significant role in weed control, as it impedes weed germination and growth by limiting their access to sunlight. Both plastic mulch and crop residue mulch offer effective weed suppression by creating unfavourable conditions for weed growth, reducing weed competition, and promoting healthier crop development.
