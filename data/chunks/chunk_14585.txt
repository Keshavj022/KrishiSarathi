All regressions use individual fixed-effect models. Women who have not participated in agriculture at all across 10 months are excluded from the sample. Standard errors are clustered at the household level. Significance levels: + 0.10, * 0.05, ** 0.01, *** 0.001. 2. Coefficients within each panel represent the specific outcome variable, that is, time spent on the activities. Specification (1) is without controls; (2) includes season and type-of-day dummies; (3) includes male wages, season, and type-of-day dummies; (4) includes all the variables in (3) plus market prices of rice, wheat, onions, potatoes, spinach, tomatoes and pigeon pea, and sickness of adults and children.
