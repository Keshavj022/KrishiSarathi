 Farmers can generate additional income through intercropping in sugarcane fields and adopting improved varieties of staple crops. Intercropping legumes in sugarcane fields enhances soil fertility due to the nitrogen-fixing ability of legumes. This practice reduces the need for chemical fertilizers, improves soil health, and promotes better sugarcane yields in the long term. The cultivation of pulses under orchards can enhance nutritional outcomes and increase income. Various livestock-related technologies were also demonstrated to provide additional income. For these newer technologies and practices to reach their full potential, mass awareness and knowledge dissemination are essential. Farmer training programs, workshops, and on-field demonstrations play a key role in educating farmers about the benefits of intercropping, adopting high-yielding varieties, efficient land use, and integrating livestock into their farming systems. *Corresponding author email: atari.kanpur@icar.gov.in Table 2.

P. Nath, Sujyanand G. K., R. K. Mishra, Vikas Maurya, Babu Singh and G. P. Dixit* ICAR-Indian Institute of Pulses Research, Kalyanpur, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh 208 024 The Farmer FIRST Programme has successfully introduced and demonstrated a variety of on- farm technological interventions to enhance farm income and productivity in rural areas of Uttar Pradesh, specifically in Fatehpur and Hamirpur districts. Focused on pulses and staple crops, the programme promoted improved sowing techniques, high-yielding and disease-resistant varieties, and effective pest management strategies. Notable outcomes include a 36% increase in net returns from line sowing of pigeon pea, a 42% yield improvement in wheat, and successful spring mungbean introduction, which yielded an average income of `103,748/ha.
