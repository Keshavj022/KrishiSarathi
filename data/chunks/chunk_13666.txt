 This study revealed that, due to the signiﬁcant heterogeneity in agro-climatic and socio- economic conditions, the type of diversiﬁcation varies among the regions. In these periods, cash- crop percentage in the gross-cropped area has increased from 18 percent to 37 percent, reﬂecting a major impact on the Shannon-Wiener diversiﬁcation index. Crop diversiﬁcation has been inﬂuenced by rural literacy, irrigation intensity, road infrastructure, per-capita, gross-state-domestic products, regional- rural-branch intensity, rainfall deviation, credit intensity, and India’s growing urban population, whereas cropping intensity has not affected crop diversiﬁcation in India.

Introduction Immediately after its independence, India’s main economic problem was feeding 361.09 million in 1951 [1]. There were severe food shortages and India had to import a sizeable amount of food grain from abroad, which amounted to 2.7 million tonnes [2]. To mitigate food shortages, India adopted a landmark reform in the agricultural sector called ‘green revolution’ in the 1960s. It resulted in a sharp growth in food-grain production from 82.71 million tonnes in 1961–1962 to 105.17 million tonnes in 1973. Between 2021 and 2022, it went up to a record high of 308.65 million tonnes [3,4]. The rise in food-grain output has mainly been restricted to cereals (rice and wheat). The production of other crops such as, coarse cereals, pulses, oilseed, fruits, and vegetables, has not been satisfactory. As a result, India imports pulses and oilseed due to the lack of supply [5]. Due to the shift of the consumer demand from traditional food grains to high-value, nutrient-rich products, there has been a gradual shift in the crop mix, as farmers have started to produce those crops locally [6,7]. For instance, the production of fruits has increased from 92,918 Metric Tons in 2016–2017 to 98,579 Metric Tons in 2018–2019; the production of vegetables has increased from 178,172 Metric Tons in 2016–2017 to 185,883 Metric Tons in 2018–2019 [8,9]. India was the largest producer of ginger and okra, and ranks second in the production of some other crops, such as potatoes, onions, cauliﬂowers, brinjal, and Sustainability 2022, 14, 16861. https://doi.org/10.3390/su142416861 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability Sustainability 2022, 14, 16861 2 of 18 cabbages. India ranks ﬁrst in the production of bananas (26.28% of total world production), papayas (44.05% of total world production), and mangoes (including mangosteens and guavas) (45.89% of total world production) under the category of fruits [10]. However, India still has a long way to go.
