Today the whole world is expecting India to ensure the availability of food grains even though India has only 2.4% of the global geographical area and 17.7% of the global population to feed. The National Agricultural Research, Education and Extension System of the country is well equipped to meet the national food security requirements of the country, yet the rapidly declining land holdings, lack of infrastructure and market-related issues have remained a cause of concern.
