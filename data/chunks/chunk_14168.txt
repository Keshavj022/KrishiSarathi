 Decelerating vehicular growth and accelerating low-emission vehicles on the road For a sustainable transport system, the primary objective should be to limit the accelerating number of vehicles on the road by promoting NMT, utilising public transport, and nudging commuters towards sustainable modes of transport. Diversion of demand and supply of vehicles towards AFVs fuelled by RE sources is the next priority. A Build-Own-Oper- ate model for green urban transport service, coupled with crowd-shipping on transit, can be helpful in electrifying pas- senger as well as last-mile goods transport. For long-haul freights, while traditional carbon credit programs could encourage logistic ﬁrms to offset emissions by funding reforestation and RE projects, freight-focused carbon offset programs could promote investment in ﬂeet renewal and green freight networks. We conclude that while the GOI has introduced numerous policies to realise its sustainability objectives, there exists a critical gap in the current policy framework—a siloed approach. The challenges encountered by various sectors should not be perceived in isolation but as opportunities for the transforma- tion of the whole economy. Enhanced cooperation and integra- tion of initiatives across different sectors lay the path for bolstering policy effectiveness and advancing India’s journey towards sustainability and decarbonisation goals.
