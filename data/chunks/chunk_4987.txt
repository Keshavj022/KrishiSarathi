 The ITK was compared on the above parameters with the recommended Leaves of parsa   PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT chemical control measure and another ITK i.e. use of puru leaves. Experiment The experimental design followed was RBD in 15 replications with four treatments, viz., T 1- Control, T 2-Application of parsa leaves @ 100 kg/ha, T 3-Application of sali leaves @100 kg/ha and T 4-Application of chlorpyriphos @ 1.0 litre/ha. Parsa and sali leaves were spread after 5 days of transplanting. Observations were taken on number of toal and damaged leaves/m 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study The data on field study have been presented in Table 1. Results indicate that the performance of parsa and puru leaves was at par with each other and superior to use of sali leaves on all the parameters studied. The leaves of parsa and puru were found to be effective. These two materials are available in the area and farmers could get them free of cost. However, use of chemical insecticide was superior in controlling the insect and getting higher yield, but it was costly and not easily available. Experiment Data presented in Table 2 indicate that percentage of caseworm infested leaves in control plot was 80.11 at 30 DAT which remained more or less same (79.42%) at 60 DAT. In case of use of parsa leaves the percent infestation was 73.51 and 25.35 at 30 DAT and 60 DAT, respectively. Chlorpyriphos application reduced the infestation Table 2.

Application of sali leaves (T 3) recorded 76.81% and 28.78% infestation of leaves at 30 DAT and 60 DAT, respectively. While the treatment effect was not significant at 30 DAT, incidence of caseworm damaged leaves reduced substantially over the control at 60 DAT. Use of parsa or sali leaves produced similar effect as that of use of chlorpyriphos.
