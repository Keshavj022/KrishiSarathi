This program, implemented in Jhansi's Bundelkhand region by the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute (ICAR-IGFRI), promotes improved crop varieties to enhance farmer productivity and income, especially in resource-limited areas. Through FFP, high-yielding and disease-resistant varieties of wheat, pulses, groundnut, and vegetables were introduced alongside improved fodder crops, like berseem and oat. Training on agronomic practices, such as summer plowing, soil testing, and weed management, further supported farmersâ€™ capacity building. Economic analysis of these improved varieties showed significant yield gains, enhanced income, and increased benefit- cost ratios compared to traditional practices. The success of FFP highlights the importance of targeted programs in addressing the needs of farmers in challenging environments, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices and rural economic growth. Keywords: Bundelkhand, Farmer FIRST, Fodder crops, Rural livelihoods, Sustainable agriculture, Yield enhancement I NDIA, as an agrarian economy, has long prioritized agricultural development, historically focusing on increasing farm production and reducing hunger. Over time, these strategies have evolved to address the changing needs and challenges faced by farmers. In recent years, there has been a significant shift towards transforming the livelihoods of farming communities, prompting the launch of innovative initiatives to enhance the agricultural landscape. A notable initiative in this regard is the Farmer FIRST Programme (FFP), led by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). This program aims to improve collaboration between farmers and scientists, facilitating the development and practical application of field-ready technologies. FFP embodies the principles of Farmers, Innovations, Resources, Science, and Technology (FIRST), highlighting its commitment to making scientific advancements accessible to the farming community. Launched in October 2016 with a budget of `1653.
