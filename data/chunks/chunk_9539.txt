 Sharma Major achievements in crop improve- ment in post independent India Rice: Release of first rice biofortified varieties (high zinc rice variety DRR Dhan 45 and high protein rice variety CR Dhan 310); and of first herbicide-tolerant (Imazethapyr) basmati varieties through Marker Assisted Selection (Pusa Basmati 1979 and Pusa Basmati 1985) in 2021. Wheat: WB2 and HPBW01, first biofortified wheat varieties. Wheat variety HD 2967 generated Rs 12,889 crore (at 2018 prices) economic surplus in 2018-19. Maize: Quality Protein Maize composite variety Shakti; the first Quality Protein Maize hybrid Shaktiman-1; India’s first public sector PUSA HM4 male sterile baby corn hybrid (Shishu). Pulses: First biofortified variety of lentil ‘ Pusa Vaibhav’ (1996); First inter-specific hybridization in urdbean ‘Mash 114’; first extra early variety of mungbean Virat maturing in 55 days. Oilseeds: Pusa mustard 25 generated Rs 14,323 crores economic surplus (2021); Indian Canola (Indola), country’s first double zero mustard variety ‘Pusa Double Zero Mustard 31’; Pusa Double Dr T.R. Sharma, Deputy Director General (Crop Science), ICAR, New Delhi, has contributed extensively in plant genomics, improvement of rice and also in mapping, cloning and functional validation of a rice- blast resistance gene and its alleles. 89 Cutting-edge Research Zero Mustard 33;, RCH 1 is country’s First Canola. Cotton: Bt-cotton approved for commercial cultivation (2002) and release of Bt cotton varieties and at present more than 93 per cent area is under Bt cotton. Jute: Development of high yielding variety of jute JRO 204; JRO 525 is strengthening jute industry in India and Bangladesh. Annually, 3500-4000 tonnes of seeds of JRO 525 are exported to Bangladesh With all these attainments, the question still arises; can we sustain food grains production? Our total food grains production was 308.65 MT (2020-21) and in global hunger index India ranked 100th out of 119 countries. India ranked 112th out of 132 countries in stunting among children aged under 5 years; 39 per cent of children under 5 years of age were underweight and many suffered from deficiencies of micronutrients such as iron (>70 per cent), vitamin A (65 per cent) and zinc (45 per cent). This scenario demands that we have to have new breeding technologies to increase crop production. Some important new technologies are as follows. Plant genomics is the study of complete genome which was started with sequencing of DNA by Sanger’s method. After 2005, next generation sequencing with different platforms such as Solexa, Ion Torent, Oxford Nanopore etc. were developed. Marker-assisted breeding is the application of molecular marker linked to the gene of interest for improving plant traits on the basis of genotypic assays.
