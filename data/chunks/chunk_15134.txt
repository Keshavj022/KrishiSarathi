 Drip irrigation is the preferred choice in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and Telangana, while sprinkler irrigation is more prevalent in Karnataka, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana (refer to Fig. 2). This trend underscores the pivotal role of focused policies and incentives in the adoption of irrigation technologies, highlighting their essentiality for successful implementation and widespread use. The potential for micro-irrigation technologies, such as drip and sprinkler irrigation, in the semi-arid states of India is around 62 million hectares (Table 1). Sprinkler irrigation is suitable for approximately 44 million hectares of crops like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, and fodder, while drip irrigation is ideal for about 17 million hectares of commercial crops, fruits, vegetables, and pulses (Palanisami et al., 2011; Chand et al., 2020). However, the actual adoption falls short, covering <20% of the potential area, with significant variation among states. Andhra Pradesh leads in drip irrigation, utilizing 72.8% of its potential area, followed by Karnataka (72.0%), Maharashtra (57.4%), Tamil Nadu (37.7%), and Haryana (15.2%). For sprinkler irrigation, Karnataka performs best with 88.1% coverage, followed by Andhra Pradesh (42.2%), Maharashtra (31.0%), Tamil Nadu (19.9%), and Haryana (18.7%). In contrast, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have not met expected adoption levels. These technologies are less beneficial for crops like paddy, commonly grown in these regions, and wheat, where sprinkler technology does not signifi­ cantly motivate adoption (Kumar et al., 2009). Limited subsidies for micro-irrigation, primarily aimed at small and marginal farmers, also hamper adoption. Due to their smaller plot sizes, these farmers often cannot afford the technologies even at subsidized rates (Suresh and Samuel, 2020). Drip and sprinkler irrigation, along with other efficient methods like rain-gun, micro-sprinklers, and subsoil drip systems, are crucial for enhancing water efficiency in agriculture. Drip irrigation offers sub­ stantial benefits, including water savings, increased water-use effi­ ciency, reduced tillage, higher-quality products, improved yields, and better fertilizer-use efficiency (Magar et al., 1988; Qureshi et al., 2001; Kumar and Palanisami, 2010; Narayanamoorthy, 1997, 2003, 2005, 2006; Namara et al., 2005; Dhawan, 2000, 2002; Verma et al., 2004; Singh and Gandhi, 2024). Well-designed and managed drip systems can double water-use efficiency, making them favorable for farmers reliant on groundwater, leading to enhanced water productivity, savings, and increased net returns per unit volume of groundwater (Sivanappan, 1994; Chandrakanth et al., 2013). Sprinkler irrigation also significantly enhances crop yields and water-use efficiency by creating a favorable microclimate for crop growth (Yang et al., 2000; Suresh and Samuel, Fig. 1.
