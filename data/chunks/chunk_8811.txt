CO 6) resulted in higher gross returns (Rs 18,166/ha) and cost: benefit ratio (1 : 1.52). Application of Alachlor at 1.0 kg a.i./ha resulted in highest grain yield and least production of weed biomass in common buckwheat.

FORAGE CROPS Crop Improvement During the year, 539 new, exotic and indigenous germplasm of different forage crops have been added at the IGFRI and other centres. And 580 accessions have been deposited for the long-term storage at the NBPGR, New Delhi. Crop Production Maximum berseem equivalent yield (144.8 tonnes/ha) was observed in guinea- grass + cowpea - berseem sequence in the irrigated areas. Inoculation of sorghum with Azotobacter and berseem with Pseudomonas gave yield advantage of 7.1%, besides improving the nutrient status of the soil. Alachlor at 1.25 kg a.i./ha as pre-emergence weedicide, followed by hand- weeding at 6 weeks showed promise in lucerne. In rainfed areas, 120 kg K2O/ha along with 40 kg N/ha, half as urea-N and remaining half as FYM slurry gave a yield advantage of 43% in Stylosanthes hamata + Cenchrus ciliaris pasture. FYM and Fertilizers in Fodder-based Cropping System Sorghum-berseem-pearl millet, fodder-based cropping system, gave higher gross monetary returns of Rs 59,340/ha, compared to sorghum-oats-pearl millet (Rs 27,080/ha) with 75% NPK + FYM at 10 tonnes/ha in kharif and rabi.
