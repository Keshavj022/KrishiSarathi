Apply 2 kg Nitrogen (4.4 kg of Urea), 1 kg of P2O5 (6.25 kg of SSP) and 1kg of K2O (1.6 kg of MOP) for a nursery bed of 5 cents (200 m2). Apply total P & K fertilizers and ½ N as basal (before final leveling and thoroughly mixed in the soil). Apply the remaining ½ N at 10-15 days after sowing depending up on seedling growth.

In light textured soils apply `K2O’ in two splits half at basal and half at panicle initiation along with 2nd top dressing of `N’. Apply Zinc Sulphate @ 50 Kg / ha to avoid the Zn deficiency. Deficiency in the standing crop can be corrected by spraying zinc sulphate @ 0.2% (2 g /l of water). The spraying should be repeated at 5 days interval depending on the severity of the problem. The crop should be maintained weed free especially till 45 DAT. Hand weeding at 20 and 40 days after transplanting in areas where sufficient manual labour is available. To overcome weed problem, apply any one of the following herbicides while keeping thin film of water. Butachlor @ 1.25 liters /acre (or) Anilophos @ 500 ml/acre (or) Pretilachlor @ 600 ml / acre (or) Oxadiargyl @ 40 grams (mixed with one litre of water) within 3 to 5 days of transplanting or spray Pyrazosulfuran ethyl @ 80-100 g/ acre at 8-12 DAT or Bensulfuron methyl @ 35 g /acre as pre to post emergence or 2,4- D SS @400 g / acre at 20-25 DAT to control broadleaved weeds.
