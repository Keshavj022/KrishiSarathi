 The country was delineated into 20 agro-ecological regions and 60 Agro-Ecological Sub- Regions. The agro-ecological region map was revised in 2016 using new soil data set, climatic resource data base of 600 weather stations and new estimates of the length of growing periods (LGP). The land degradation map of India was developed in 1994 which was further refined in 2010 using the harmonized data base of land degradation of other agencies (Fig. 3). The estimates showed that about 120.4 Mha of total geographical area of the country is affected by various kinds of land degradation (NAAS, 2010). This includes water erosion (82.6 Mha), wind erosion (12.0 Mha), chemical degradation (24.8 Mha) and physical degradation (1.0 Mha). The large chunk of these degraded soils (104.2 Mha) Indian Agriculture after Independence 262 comes under arable lands. As Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a universal indicator of soil health and quality, the extent and spatial distribution of SOC was depicted through the SOC map of India (Fig. 4) which is now a part of Global SOC map published by FAO. Recently, BHOOMI Geo-portal, a Gateway to Soil Geospatial database has been developed and dedicated to soil resources of the nation. Fig. 1. Soil map of India Fig. 2.

Soil organic carbon map of India Achievements in Natural Resource Management in Independent India 263 Table 1. Milestones in conserving and managing natural resources Year Milestone 1967 Targeted yield concept was for determining fertilizer requirement. 1970 Developed gypsum technology for reclamation of sodic soils. 1971 Sand-dune stabilization and shelter-belt plantation techniques was developed to control desertification in arid zone. 1975 • Optimum irrigation schedules were formulated for different crops using surface and drip irrigation. • Neem oil as a nitrification inhibitor was formulated to enhance nitrogen use efficiency. 1982-83 Developed 47 model watersheds. 1983 Estimation of soil erosion in India. 1984 Developed sub-surface drainage (SSD) technology. 1988 Improved Doruvu system developed for sub-surface water harvesting in coastal areas. 1990 Prepared Agro-Ecological Region Map of India. 1992 National guidelines were formulated for using saline and alkali water for irrigation purpose. 1994 National groundwater quality map was prepared for irrigation purpose. 1999 Prepared Agro-Ecological Sub-region map of India. 1991- 2000 Soil degradation maps of the country (1:4.4 million scale) and different states of the country (1: 2,50,000 scale) were prepared. 2001 Atlas of pre-dominant cropping systems covering 17 states and 14 agro climatic zones was prepared. 2001- 2010 Soil maps of the states (1:250,000 scale) and several districts (1:50,000 scale) of the country were prepared. 2005 Developed liming technology for amelioration of degraded acid soils.
