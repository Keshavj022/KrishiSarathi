Pusa Ujwal IARI,NewDelhi VIII 2007 Production technologies developed: Recommendations for 2002‐03 Use of biofertilizers • Maximum yield (86.39 q/ha) and C:B ratio (1: 2.82) were recorded with the application of Azospirillum along with 100% recommended dose of nitrogen in chillies cv.Azad Mirch‐I. Hence, it is recommended for Kanpur conditions. • The maximum yield of cauliflower cv. Pusa Snowball K‐I (304.5 q/ha) and C:B ratio (1 :3.88) were recorded with the application of PSB @ 500 g/ha as seedlings root dip along with recommended dose of NPK through fertilizers. Hence, it is recommended for Pantnagar conditions. Use of liquid fertilizers • At Hyderabad, maximum yield of brinjal (365.6 q/ha) with C:B ratio (1 :3.8) were obtained with 5 sprays of water soluble fertilizer having the combination ofNPK 15 : 15 :30. Hence, it is recommended for Hyderabad conditions. • At Kalyanpur 5 foliar applications of water soluble fertilizer NPK (17: 10:27) at 10 days interval resulted in maximum yield (241.5 q/ha) and C:B ratio (1: 2.97) in tomato cv. Type ‐1. Hence, it is recommended for Kanpur conditions. • At Jabalpur, the maximum yield of tomato (269.28 q/ha) along with the C:B ratio (1 :2.08) were obtained with 5 sprays of Multi K 13:0:45 applied at 10 days interval after 40 days transplanting. Hence, it is recommended for Satpura hills and Kaymore plateau region of M.P. • At Coimbatore foliar application of water soluble fertilizer NPK (19 :19: 19) 5 times at 10 days interval starting from 40 days after transplanting resulted in maximum yield (556 q/ha) and C:B ratio (1 :5.05) in Brinjal Hybrid ‐1 ( COBH‐I). Hence, it is recommended for Coimbatore conditions. Use of micronutrients • At Pantnagar, maximum yield (314 q/ha) and C:B ratio (1 :2.15) along with high TSS (5.7%) and shelf life (7.
