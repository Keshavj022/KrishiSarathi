 JS 20- 34 Seed Treatment Seed Germination test ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 132 Maize   Extra early maturing variety: JM-08, Vivek Hy-17, Vivek Hy-43, Pratap Shankar Hy-1   Early maturing variety: PMH-5, HIM-129, Prakash, MCU-508, DKC-7074, Pro-368, Seed Tech-2324, Kohinoor, JM-12, JM-215 (Yellow/ Orange seed, flinty and round shape; suitable for light to very light type of soil).   Medium maturity variety: Pusa Jawahar Hybrid Maize-1, HQPM-1, HQPM-5, DHM-121, Vivek Makka Hy-51, HM-10, HM-04, Jawahar Makka-216, KMH-3426, NMH-303, NMH-3712, P-3441, BIO- 9682, N-21, X-3342, COH-10, COH-10.   Late maturing variety: HM-11, NMH-731, BISCE-855.   Jawahar maize-218 released in 2019. Recommended for Madhya Pradesh, medium duration for maturity, seed yellow /orange, flinty and round shape; multi cob nature suitable for baby corn   The pupa of fall army worm, stem borer and spore of Rhizoctonia solani, Sheath blight causing agent remain in soil. Therefore summer deep ploughing is most important to minimized inoculum potetial.   Biopriming/Seed treatment with Carbendazim 2g+ lmidachloprid 2g /kg + Trichoderma10g /kg + Azotobactor 2g/ kg seed followed by its germination test is must to get the optimum number of healthy plants in the field.   The Infestation of Fall Army Worm can be minimized up to great level by dry sowing or sowing with onset of monsoon, practice crop rotation. Alternate maize with crops that are not attacked by the FAW, application of basal dose of nutrients and R&F preparation must be concluded by last week of May or first week of June. Paddy   Use of high yielding variety like Early-Danteswari, JR206, JR81, Sahbhagi and MTU 1010. Medium- Kranti and Mahamaya (Bold grain), IR 35, IR 64 (Medium slender grain), Pusa Basmati 1 and Pusasugandha 5(Scented), Pusa- 1509, Pusa-1692, Late- MTU1001, MTU 7029 (Swarna) and BPT 5204   High yielding early hybrid like JRH 5,JRH 19 and Indira Sona.   Summer ploughing of field, green mannuring use dhaincha, sunhemp, ud or moong, seed treatment (organic-Trichoderma viridae, Pseudomonas flueroscense 5-10g/kg or chemical carbendazim 25% + Mancozeb 50% 3g/kg of seed). Jawahar Makka 216 Summer deep ploughing MTU 1010 ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 133   Preparation of nursery for SRI- Well pulverized nursery, having 1 meter width length is needed should be prepared in May. During preparation of nursery huge amount of well decomposed FYM should be added to nursery. This FYM will facilitate easy and undamaged uprooting of seedling for its transplanting (25Xl5 cm). The date of nursery planting may be adjusted at per availability of water and or onset of monsoon.   Weed management-timely manual weeding should be done if labour is available, or use of pre emergence herbicides like pretilachlor 500ml/acre or pyrazosulphuran 80gm/acre for post emergence bispyriback sodium 100ml/ acre.   For best plant protection measure timely contact to KVKs scientist of the district.
