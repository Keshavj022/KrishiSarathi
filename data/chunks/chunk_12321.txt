Scarce Rainfall: District: Anantapur(groundnut, sweet lime, mango, pomegranate, vegetables.)

North Coastal Zone, Godavari Zone, Krishna Zone, Southern Zone and Scarce Rainfall Zone: Applicable to all districts of Andhra Pradesh Livelihood diversification and stability of income Mother Units in villages- Potential model for 1000 birds (Up to 6 weeks of age) Setting up of mother units can be taken up by unemployed youth/ women farmers. The aim is to produce grown up chicks (6 weeks of age) of desi chicken breeds (Vanaraja, Gramapriya, Srinidhi, Rajasree) for free range poultry. The cost/ bird, Rs. 64 and sale price, Rs.8/ bird. The net returns/year (6cycles) is Rs. 126000. The litter can be sold @ Rs 1000/ton. Birds in the mother unit can be reared up to 10-15 weeks to produce coloured birds for meat purpose. Livelihood diversification and stability of income poultry Rural Hatchery Units for Backyard Poultry Rural hatchery unit can be set up by rural youth and women farmers. The aim of the unit is to hatch out baby chicks from fertile eggs produced from rural / free range poultry farming. It provides work opportunity all through the year (12 cycles in a year). The profit obtained by this potential model (24,000 eggs hatcher at 28d interval) in 5 years is Rs.1848000.
