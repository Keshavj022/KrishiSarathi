44 kg/hm2 Groundwater depletion () Share of groundwater irrigated area to total irrigated area (%) Depletion of groundwater affects the hydrological cycle, and thereby agricultural sustainability. MoAFW (2019) 54.32% Livestock ownership (þ) Percentage of households with livestock (%) Integrated crop-livestock systems lead to better nutrient cycling, biomass utilization, and accumulation of soil carbon. NSSO (2019) 75.58% Rainfall variability () Coefﬁcient of rainfall variation during 1991–2020 Rainfall variability has signiﬁcant negative impact on agricultural sustainability. IMD (2020) 38.70 Minimum temperature variability () Coefﬁcient of minimum temperature variation during 1991–2020 Minimum temperature variability has signiﬁcant negative impact on agricultural sustainability. IMD (2020) 61.72 Maximum temperature variability () Coefﬁcient of maximum temperature variation during 1991–2020 Maximum temperature variability has signiﬁcant negative impact on agricultural sustainability. IMD (2020) 4.20 Cropping intensity (þ) Crop intensity ¼ total cropped area/ total sown area  100% (%) High cropping intensity signiﬁcantly contributes to agricultural sustainability. MoAFW (2019) 139.35% Farmers' perception on natural calamities (þ) Percentage of farmers perceived that natural calamities destroy crops (%) The understanding of crop damage by natural disasters is positivity associated with agricultural sustainability. NSSO (2019) 64.63% Economic security index Man-land ratio () Rural population per hectare of net sown area (persons/hm2) Man-land ratio has negative inﬂuence on agricultural sustainability. ORGI (2011), MoAFW (2019) 21 persons/ hm2 Per capita income (þ) Per capita income of farmer (USD) Per capita income has positive inﬂuence on agricultural sustainability. NSSO (2019) 689.63 USD Irrigation intensity (þ) Irrigation intensity ¼ total irrigated area/total sown area  100% (%) Irrigation positively imparts resilience to crops and inﬂuences agricultural sustainability. MoAFW (2019) 119.13% Road transport (þ) Percentage of rural population access to road (%) Road transport has signiﬁcant impact on agricultural production and has positive association with agricultural sustainability. ORGI (2011) 59.20% Institutional credit (þ) Percentage of farmers who have taken credit from institutional sources (%) Institutional agriculture credit is relatively cheaper and covers crop insurance. NSSO (2019) 51.41% Food grain productivity (þ) Food grain production per hectare of sown area (t/hm2) Higher food grain productivity ensures food security and also results in high income as it supports agricultural price policy. MoAFW (2019) 2.49 t/ hm2 Crop diversiﬁcation (þ) Simpson diversiﬁcation index (SDI) Higher SDI leads to lower economic risk. GoI (2016); Singh (2020b) 13.
