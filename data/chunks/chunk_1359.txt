69 lt/cow/day, which boosted gross income by `16,712/cow/year. Similarly, for buffalo management, inputs were provided to 49 farmers, resulting in an additional milk yield of 0.96 lt/day. Before adoption, farmers were earning `75,240/year, Table 1.

Previously, no farmers practiced poultry farming, but under the program, 10 farmers were introduced to this new enterprise, generating around `7,000/year from poultry farming. Technological assemblage: Secondary agricultural module Training, demonstration and handholding through self help group was done through value addition and processing of different products viz. pickle making, jaggery cubes, turmeric powder, squash preparation, etc. Support was provided for product packaging and its sale in exhibitions, kisan mela and direct marketing. Secondary agriculture module leads to additional gain of ~ `206,650 to formulated Self Help Group which is helpful in enhanced family income*. The group has linked to ABI (Agri-Business Incubation) programme of ICAR-IIFSR. Marketing of developed value-added products through exhibition Economic impact of technological interventions The highest increase in Net income was noticed in Labour + Goat farming system (201%) followed by labour + dairy + small ruminants (65%). Introduction of piggery leads to additional gain of ~ `23,621 landless household -1 whereas backyard poultry leads to additional gain of ~8643 landless household -1 Nutritional impact of technological interventions Significant improvement in food consumption pattern was noticed in terms of GLV’s, (22 to 46%) other vegetables, (15-36%) fruits, 52-84%, milk (9-27%) meat products (0-88%). Sugar and Jaggary (-50 to-77% i.e. equivalent to RDA. CONCLUSION In Western Uttar Pradesh, where most farmers have small landholdings, maximizing farm productivity and income generation is challenging. Limited land availability necessitates innovative approaches to meet both the region’s food demands and the economic needs of farmers. To address these challenges, adopting a well-structured farming system, selecting appropriate crop varieties, utilizing land efficiently, and applying location-specific technologies can significantly enhance farm productivity and income.
