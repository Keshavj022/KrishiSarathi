 Strategy and Interventions for Southern Zone- strategies and interventions Strategy 1: Productivity Enhancement   Adoption of improved tobacco varieties/hybrids (Siri and Hema for Black Soils and N-98 for red soils)   Pro-tray vegetable seedling production (tomato, chillies)   High density planting of mango & guava   Virus free budlings of sweet orange & acid lime   Micronutrients & soil test based INM –In Groundnut, Yield improvements of 28% during 2015-16 in Chittoor   Seed production of Rice, Redgram, Korra, Castor, Mungari Cotton through farmers groups.   Open / Protected cultivation - Marigold, Jasmine, Crossandra, Lilly, Chrysanthemum   Rainwater harvesting in farm ponds for supplemental irrigation through micro irrigation   Rain guns for life saving irrigation in groundnut and high value crops   Production and supply of quality groundnut seed through Mana vitana Kendras (Our Seed Centers) involving farmers clubs for village level seed production and certification State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 14 Strategy 2: Cost reduction   Intercropping systems redgram + foxtail millet/ pearl millet/ groundnut   Promotion of micro irrigation in high value crops like sweet orange and vegetables.   In situ rainwater harvesting   Virus free citrus (lemon) planting material   Use of bio mulches in sweet orange   Soil test based nutrient application   Foliar application of micronutrients Zn, Bo, Mg & Fe   Use of Aqua seed drill for timely sowing without wasting of available soil moisture. Strategy 3: Quality Improvement/ Processing/ value addition/ niche markets   Processing varieties of mango, tomato   Value addition of millets. Establishment of minimal processing units for seed grading and cleaning units for millets and grains   Bulk milk coolers and value addition of milk and milk products   Establishment of mandal level cold storage facilities   Promotion of Farmers clubs/ FPOs/FPCs for value chains and market linkages Strategy 4: Generation of additional income   Ram lamb rearing in horti-pasture systems   Dairy + Goatery+ BYP + Horticulture   Mushroom cultivation   Sericulture   Cottage enterprises – jam, jelly, pickle, juice, banana chips, milk products   Apiculture for small farmers and landless   Mini-dairy with year round fodder production, mineral supplementation, silage making   Mother units / local hatchery units for BY Poultry   Cluster farming @500-1000 broiler birds by 8-10 youth in low cost housing E. Scarce Rainfall Zone (Anantapur, Kurnool) The Scarce rainfall zone comprises of two districts i.e., Anantapur and Kurnool. This zone has red with loamy soils, sandy soils and black cotton soils in pockets. The normal rainfall of the zone is about 500-750 mm.
