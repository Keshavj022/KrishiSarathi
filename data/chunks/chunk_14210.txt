 For comparative analysis, Dd, Df, Di and Dp are also computed using the DTRT with SPEI thresholds (Fig. 16b, 16e, 16 h and 16 k). The respective grid-wise CC values between SSMI and SPEI-derived Dd, Df, Di and Dp are presented as boxplots in Fig. 16c, 16f, 16i and 16 l. For Dd, the median CC is 0.70, ranging from 0.30 to 0.96 (Fig. 16c). Likewise, for Df, the median CC is at 0.69, with a range from 0.25 to 0.96 (Fig. 16f). For Di, the median correlation aligns closely at 0.69, spanning from 0.22 to 0.96 (Fig. 16i). Lastly, for Dp, the median CC stands out at 0.72, with a range from 0.40 to 0.96 (Fig. 16l). The boxplots reveal that the CC values between SSMI and SPEI metrics are generally high, indicating a strong agreement between these two indices in capturing drought character- istics. However, there are notable outliers in the correlations for Dp, where values extend down to 0.22 suggesting significant deviations between SSMI and SPEI-derived Dp measurements in specific grid cells. The lower CC values might reflect areas where SSMI and SPEI measure slightly different aspects of drought dynamics or where the indices are influenced by unique local factors not captured uniformly across the region. 5. Conclusions This study looks at the potential of ESACCI SM data to understand agricultural drought conditions in SPH during the period of 1991 to 2020. Initially, two SM-based indices SSMI (parametric) and ESSMI (non-parametric) are used and compared to SPI and SPEI to assess their effectiveness in assessing agricultural drought. While these drought indices offer insights into general drought status, they may provide only a partial understanding. To achieve a more comprehensive under- standing, DTRT is proposed to characterize drought events in terms of drought duration (Dd), frequency (Df), intensity (Di) and peak (Dp). The main outcomes from this study can be summarized as follow: Table 1 Proportion of DAR for different drought classes distributed across study period reflected by SSMI, ESSMI, SPI and SPEI in SPH from 1991 to 2020.
