 In order to enhance the content of iron and zinc further and with an aim to reduce the micronutrient deficiency among the people consuming pearl millet as staple food, HarvestPlus in association with ICRISAT started working on pearl millet biofortification in the early 2000s. By exploiting variability available within population of a germplasm line ICTP 8203 for iron content, an improved version, ICTP 8203 Fe-10-2 was developed. It was released as ‘Dhanshakti’ in collaboration with MPKV, Rahuri first in 2012 in Maharashtra and later across India in 2014. The variety is adapted to Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab. Three independent studies showed that consumption of 200 g of ‘Dhanshakti’ can meet 100% of recommended daily allowance (RDA) of iron in adult men and children in India and 60% of the RDA in non-pregnant and non- lactating women. Studies also indicated that feeding iron rich pearl millet is an efficacious approach to improve iron status in school-age children. The food products made out of Dhanshakti were readily accepted by both mothers and children. ICAR’s initiative to develop biofortified varieties In order to accelerate the development of biofortified varieties and enhance the nutritional value of commonly consumed staples, ICAR launched a Consortia Research Table 1.

The programme has resulted in development of about 17 biofortified varieties of rice, wheat, maize and pearl millet. Further research efforts in all the crops are still ongoing. Biofortified pearl millet cultivars The All India Coordinated Research Project on Pearl Millet (AICRP-Pearl Millet) is working on development of biofortified pearl millet cultivars. Separate biofortification trials were conducted to evaluate pearl millet varieties and hybrids with high iron and zinc content.
