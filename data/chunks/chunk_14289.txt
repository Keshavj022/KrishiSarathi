Many studies have used these goals in decision support frameworks to identify the most effective treatment among those examined. While this approach is valuable, it lacks actionable guidance for farmers regarding maximizing return, while minimizing risk. It does not provide specific recommendations on how to allocate land across various cropping systems and tillage practices to achieve such objectives. This would require another long-term experiment exploring various combinations of treatments. To address this challenge, we propose the application of modern portfolio theory, specifically leveraging mean-variance and conditional value at risk optimization models.
