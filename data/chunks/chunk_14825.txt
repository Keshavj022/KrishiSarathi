 Therefore, we characterised the spatial variations in drought hazard (degree of severity analysed through assessment of probability and drought intensity), drought exposure, and drought vulnerability to identify the total drought risk for crop production. A flowchart (Fig. 2) for agriculture drought risk assessment was developed by referring to methods and processes adopted by previous researchers (Prabnakorn et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2020). Analysis of agricultural drought risk elements. Both climate and socio- economic data were considered for the agricultural drought risk anal­ ysis. Climate data included daily precipitation, and maximum and Table 2 Intensity scale for drought categorisation based on SPEI range (Beguería et al., 2010; Musei et al., 2021; Ripin et al., 1989; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010a). Class SPEI value Drought category 1 2.0 or greater Extremely wet 2 1.50 to 1.99 Severely wet 3 1.00 to 1.49 Moderately wet 4 0.99 to −0.99 Near normal 5 −1.00 to −1.49 Moderately dry 6 −1.50 to −1.99 Severely dry 7 −2.00 or less Extremely dry K.P.

To identify the worst-case scenarios for drought hazards (i.e., year with highest number of sever-to-extreme droughts), each statistical indicator of drought characteristics was analysed using the theory of runs. Drought characteristics based on theory of runs. The 12-month SPEI drought indices were utilised to assess the spatial and temporal changes in drought characteristics, with threshold values of −1 and 1 for dry and wet episodes, respectively. The statistical indicators were computed based on the definitions provided in Table 3. Fig. 3 shows the diagrammatic representation of drought charac­ teristics. The positive and negative values of SPEI are considered drought and non-drought events, respectively. A drought event is defined as a period with SPEI values below the threshold. Therefore, to measure the drought duration and drought severity, a threshold value was defined. The drought duration is the period through which SPEI is continuously negative, that is, it starts when SPEI = −1 and ends when SPEI > 0. The drought severity is the cumulated SPEI value within the drought duration, and it is defined by the equation provided in Table 3. The drought intensity is the ratio of drought severity to its duration, and it represents the magnitude of the drought event. The drought charac­ teristics were estimated using the 12-month SPEI over the entire base­ line reference period (1981–2019). Based on the time-series analysis of drought statistics (drought frequency, occurrence number, severity, magnitude, intensity), a year was identified for the worst-case drought scenario (i.e., the year mostly affected by severe-to-extreme droughts with higher drought severity).
