The estimates ranged from Rs. 801.60 per acre (Redgram) to Rs. 13,799.20 per acre (Tomato). The meta-analysis confirmed the performance trends identified through individual statistical procedures, aligning with Janne et al. (2005), who found organic farming often enhances species richness, though results vary. Negative estimated values were also reported, ranging from Rs. -1,935 per acre (Cotton) to Rs. -8,092.30 per acre (Turmeric). These findings corroborate those from previous analyses, showing consistency between meta-analytic and standard statistical approaches.

The analysis, employing the Random Effect Model due to significant heterogeneity (p = 0.000), revealed an average profit of Rs. 3,850 per acre for organic agriculture compared to inorganic agriculture in India. This significant result was supported by the Random Effect Model's estimate. Figure 1 shows the Forest plot, illustrating that the estimated profit from organic agriculture (Rs.
