 Description (Background) * Mastitis in Dairy Animals: * Definition: Mastitis is a prevalent and economically burdensome production disease in dairy animals. ¢ Significance: Global economic impact estimated at 20-30 billion US dollars. ¢ Impact in India: Approximately INR 7165.51 crores in losses. * Causes and Pathogens: * Factors: Poor sanitation and hygiene practices contribute significantly. * Common Pathogens: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis. * Prevalence and Incidence Rates: * Worldwide: Subclinical mastitis (SCM) prevalence of 42%, clinical mastitis (CM) prevalence of 15%. * India: SCM prevalence of 45%, CM prevalence of 18%. The comprehensive technology involves optimizing thermal image acquisition for lactating cows, refining camera calibration in milking parlors, and establishing animal preparation protocols. We utilize a high image resolution (384 x 288) digital IR with a temperature range of -20 °C to +650 °C. Additionally, we will install IR cameras/gadgets to automatically capture thermograms of the lactating cows at the milking parlor of LRC, ICAR- NDRI, Karnal, Haryana, India. The scope of image capture will expand to diverse environmental conditions, incorporating lighting and animal behavior considerations. Continuous refinement of thermogram analysis software will integrate advanced algorithms for precise temperature variation detection, and robust quality control measures will be implemented for image clarity. In-depth statistical analysis will explore udder and teat skin surface temperature patterns. Collaboration with experts and validation from veterinary professionals will ensure scientific rigour. The plan includes technology transfer and adoption strategies, emphasizing continuous improvement and staying abreast of technological advancements. Additionally, the project envisions integrating applied artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (loT) specifically for mastitis detection. This includes exploring methods for automatically capturing IR images in the farm setup, allowing for online automatic updates to the database. Small farmers can utilize mobile devices equipped with loT gadgets for Infrared Thermography (IRT), capturing images in their farms or homes. These images will seamlessly feed into the database, enabling automatic detection of mastitis status TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 98 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 99 in dairy animals by image processing algorithm, thereby enhancing accessibility and usability of the technology for farmers at all scales. The study was conducted at the Livestock Research Centre (LRC), ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana. Karnal is located at latitude 290 43“ N and longitude 770 2” E, with an elevation (attitude) of 250 m above sea level.
