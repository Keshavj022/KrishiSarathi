5 ml/litre of water can be done at sowing time at proper soil moisture stage. Trichoderma @ 1.25 kg, Pseudomonas 2.5 kg and Bacillus 2.5 kg per hectare can be applied one week after application of basal recommended dose of fertilizer and chemical insecticides to obtain healthy seedlings. For transplanting on one hectare area, about 8-10 kg seed is recommended for nursery raising. As per experience of some onion growers, if the nursery is managed properly about 3.750- 4.375 kg seed is sufficient for 1 hectare. Before sowing, the seeds are to be treated with captan or carbendazim @ 2-3 g/kg of seed. Treated and packed seeds do not require treatment again. Two hand weedings are found effective to control the weed population in onion nursery. In case of weedicide, it is advised to spray pendimethalin at 2 ml/ litre of water before onion seed germination followed by hand weeding at 20-25 days after sowing (DAS). Onion seedlings in nursery can be attacked by different insect pests and diseases. So some control measures are to be taken for getting healthy, pest and diseases free seedlings. Thrips is a major pest of onion. Fipronil 5 SC at 1 ml/litre of water or carbosulfan 25% EC at 2 ml/litre of water can be sprayed to manage thrips population. Sticker is to be used during rainy season. Cloudy weather and dew formation favours fungal diseases like root rot, damping off, wilt, Cholototrichum blight, etc. Stagnation of water and inadequate drainage favours seedling root rot in nursery. Root rot can be managed by drenching of copper oxychloride at 3 g/litre of water. Drenching of metalaxyl 4% + mancozeb 64 % at 2 g/ litre of water between the rows can manage wilt disease. Since 2 years onion is heavily infected by blight disease caused by Cholototrichum gloeosporioides fungus in nursery and after transplanting also. Integrated approach to be followed for disease management is given below. Nursery stage y Maize crop is to be sown as border crop 15 days before onion nursery sowing and transplanting. y Crop rotation should be followed. y Removal of previous plants residues from the field. y Application of Trichoderma @ 1.25 kg, Pseudomonas 2.5 kg and Bacillus 2.5 kg/ha. y Seed treatment with captan or carbendazim @ 2-3 g/kg of seed. y Prefer well drained soil. y In case of continuous rain drenching (per litre of water): Use Metalaxyl 4% + mancozeb 64% @ 2 g, Captan @ 2 g + potassium humate 1 g. y Fungicides are to be sprayed (per litre of water): At 15-20 day after sowing: Mancozeb 2.5 g; At 25-30 day after sowing: Hexaconazole 1 g y Water soluble fertilizers and micronutrients spray (per litre of water): At 20 DAS: 19:19:19 @ 2.5 g and 1 g Grade-II (Zn 3%, Fe 2.5 %, Mn 1%, Cu 1% and B 0.5%). Transplanting stage (TP): Seedling root dipping treatment Root dipping in solution: Fungicide carbendazim 1 g and insecticide carbosulfan 2 ml/litre of water.
