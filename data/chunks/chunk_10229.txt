 Before the Green revolution, millets made up around 40% of all cultivated grains, which has dropped to around 20% over the years. Despite the many benefits of growing millets, there has been a downward trend in the cultivation of millets in the country. In the past six decades, the area under millets has gone down by 62.57%, dropping from 36.34 Mha (1955-56) to around 13.83 Mha (2019-20). Yet, the production target of all millet crops is maintained with an increase in productivity per hectare over 4 times in pearl millet and more than 2 times in sorghum, finger millet, and small millet crops over the decades. Achievements in Field Crops in Independent India 89 After independence, enormous progress has been made to improve the productivity of sorghum, pearl millet, and small millets by developing high-yielding cultivars and hybrids. In fact, sorghum and pearl millet hybrids established the seed industry in the country. Hybrids were successfully developed in sorghum (often cross-pollinated crop) and pearl millet (cross-pollinated crop) due to the availability of the male sterility system for hybrid seed production. Private entrepreneurs and companies have also contributed significantly to the development of superior hybrids and their commercialization in pearl millet, forage sorghum, and grain sorghum. Through ICAR- AICRP on pearl millet, a total of 206 varieties and hybrids were released for cultivation in different agro-ecological zones of the country. It is the first crop where MAS strategies and tools were applied to develop Improved HHB 67, and to develop biofortified variety “Dhanashakti” in collaboration with ICRISAT and Harvest Plus programs. Some biofortified hybrids, AHB 1200, AHB1269, HHB 299, HHB 311, RHB 233 and RHB 234, GHB 1129 with high iron & zinc were released. Development of CMS lines for hybrid development remarkably contributed in yield improvement during the second phase (1967–1983) of crop improvement in which an annual increase of 6.6 kg ha-1 in productivity was achieved. Similarly, during phase III (1984–2000), many genetically diverse CMS lines were developed and utilized in hybrid breeding. In phase III, 19.0 kg ha-1 yr-1 productivity was achieved. During phase IV (2001– 2018), greater emphasis was on genetic diversification and adaptation to niche areas of cultivation. The grain productivity further increased to 31.1 kg ha-1 yr-1 during this phase. The overall productivity gain was about 470% of the productivity gain achieved during the first phase (Yadav et al. 2021). Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing technology helped to formulate 1,000 genomes sequencing projects, which is a major milestone in pearl millet improvement (Varshney et al. 2017). This project will help in better exploration of available genetic resources, QTL/gene mapping, marker development, and most importantly for genomic selection.
