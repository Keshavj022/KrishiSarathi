 The utilization hydrogen-rich environment in biomass pyrolysis integrates with India's commitment to sustainable energy [104]. Furthermore, the Indian Bureaucracy strongly focussed on advancing hydrogen energy production and overcoming difficulties to reflect a sustainable future of India in green energy. 7.8 India Initiatives to Harness Agricultural Waste for Hydrogen Production India is making significant strides in harnessing agricultural waste for hydrogen production as part of its broader energy transition goals outlined in the National Hydrogen Energy Mission. The country is exploring innovative technologies, including microbial hydrogen production and plasma-based gasification, to convert agricultural residues into sustainable hydrogen fuel. These initiatives aim to address energy needs, manage waste, and reduce environmental impact, supporting Indiaâ€™s commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. 7.8.1 Direct Hydrogen Generation Technology Indian researchers have developed a unique technology for the direct generation of hydrogen from agricultural residues. This innovation aims to promote eco-friendly hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicles by addressing hydrogen availability challenges. Direct Hydrogen Generation Technology (DHGT) is an innovative method to produce hydrogen directly from agricultural residues without intermediate steps like syngas formation. It uses advanced catalysts for efficient conversion, operates at lower costs, and is eco- friendly. DHGT is particularly suited for rural and decentralized applications in India, helping reduce stubble burning, manage agricultural waste, and support green hydrogen goals under the National Hydrogen Energy Mission [105,106]. 7.8.2 Microbial Hydrogen Production The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) has researched producing hydrogen from agricultural waste using microbial processes. They have isolated a unique microbe, Enterobacter cloacae, capable of generating clean hydrogen from various agri-waste biomass sources, including rice straw and sugarcane bagasse. Microbial Hydrogen Production in India uses microbes like Enterobacter cloacae to convert agricultural residues, such as rice straw and sugarcane bagasse, into hydrogen through biological processes like dark and photofermentation. This eco-friendly and renewable method aligns with India's abundant biomass resources and growing energy demands. Research institutions like TERI and IITs are driving advancements in this field, supported by the National Hydrogen Energy Mission. The technology offers a sustainable solution for managing agricultural waste, reducing stubble burning, and providing decentralized energy to rural areas. While challenges include low yields and high costs, the potential for scalable, clean hydrogen production positions microbial methods as a key contributor to India's green energy future [107,108]. 7.8.3 NTPC's Plasma-Based Oxy-Gasification NTPC Ltd.
