 In Southeast Asia, substantial progress has been made in mapping oil palm plantations through the application of machine learning (ML) models utilizing high-resolution satellite data. For example, impressive accuracy levels was achieved between 85 and 95% when mapping oil palm plantations with Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery. This study highlighted the effectiveness of integrating machine learning techniques with satellite data to create accurate and reliable land cover maps, which are essential for improved agricultural management and informed policy- making. In Malaysia, the use of high-resolution imagery combined with labeled datasets for training deep learning (DL) models has shown a marked improvement in the accuracy and efficiency of oil palm tree detection. These DL approaches effectively tackle challenges such as varying tree sizes, overlapping canopies, and diverse environmental conditions, providing a scalable and precise solution for monitoring and managing oil palm plantations. Similarly, in Indonesia, a comparison between machine learning and non-machine learning techniques Indian Horticulture 52 utilizing Sentinel-2 data revealed that while both methods yield satisfactory results, ML techniques significantly enhance mapping accuracy. This is attributed to their capability to manage complex, non-linear relationships within the data. In Thailand, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with Sentinel-2 imagery, a notable accuracy range of 89 to 93% could be achieved in mapping both oil palm and rubber plantations. In Colombia also, Sentinel-2 data with CNNs was used to map oil palm plantations, achieving an accuracy of 90%. Similarly, in Indonesia, combined synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical satellite data using CNNs were employed to accurately map industrial oil palm plantations, reporting a 90% accuracy rate. This approach exemplifies the potential of integrating multiple data sources to enhance mapping precision. Machine learning techniques, including random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks, have consistently achieved impressive accuracy rates between 85 and 95% in mapping major plantation crops. The integration of advanced satellite data, particularly from Sentinel and Landsat imagery, is revolutionizing agricultural monitoring and management practices. These advancements significantly contribute to sustainable agricultural development and informed decision-making in the plantation sector. As a result, farmers are now able to adopt more precise agricultural practices, leading to better resource utilization and enhanced environmental sustainability in the region. Indian context: India has recognized the need to boost domestic palm oil production due to its heavy reliance on imports. In India, the use of GIS and MCDA techniques were explored to identify suitable areas for oil-palm cultivation.
