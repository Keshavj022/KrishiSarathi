 viride in inhibiting growth of isolates of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri. Seed treatment with Carbosulfan 25 ST at 3% reduced root-knot nematode population. At IIPR, Kanpur, Lufenuron and Acephate effectively reduced pod damage. β-Cyfluthrin 18.75 g a.i./ha and Koranda are found superior to Endosulfan in controlling Helicoverpa armigera. PIGEONPEA The year 2000-2001 has not been congenial for pigeonpea due to moisture stress in the central and south India, in spite of moderate infestation of Helicoverpa and other pests. Crop Improvement CMS 288 A and 67 A pigeonpea have proved to be stable across the locations. The notable achievement is the identification of 18 fertility restorer lines against CMS 288A. Breeder seed of 23.36 tonnes of 29 varieties has been produced against the DAC indent of 8.85 tonnes. Crop Production Intercropping pigeonpea in mungbean/urdbean/soybean has proved superior to sorghum or pearl millet, and 2% urea spray at 15 and 45 days after harvest of intercrop could increase yield of pigeonpea. Zinc sulphate at 15 kg/ha along with the recommended NPKS at (20-18-27-20) increased productivity up to 28%. New strains of rhizobium A-5, A-7, RAU-10, BPR-9804 and 9806 have showed promise. Released varieties of pigeonpea Variety Adaptation Yield Duration Salient features region/agro- (tonnes/ha) (days) ecology Laxmi Andhra Pradesh 1.8-2.0 175-180 Resistant to sterility (ICPL 85063) mosaic disease and tolerant to wilt disease AKT 8811 Maharashtra 1.1-1.3 140-150 Tolerant to Fusarium wilt Pigeonpea KPL 44. It shows resistance against wilt, Phytophthora blight and sterility mosaic disease DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 34 Crop Protection Pigeonpea sowing on ridges reduced incidence of Phytophthora blight by nearly 50% as compared to flat sowing. MAL 9 was found resistant to pigeonpea cyst nematode (Heterodera cajani) and Pusa (B) 35 exhibited tolerance to cyst and root-knot nematodes KPL 43 and GPS 33 also showed resistance to root-knot nematode. Carbofuran at 2 kg a.i./ha to soil and seed treatment with Monocrotophos at 0.1% for 6 hours increased yield of pigeonpea by 38.9 and 18.6% over control in root-knot nematode infested fields. MUNGBEAN AND URDBEAN Crop Improvement Mungbean ML 818 selected from 5145/87 × ML 267 has been identified for Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. It is resistant to yellow mosaic virus, Cercospora leaf spot and bacterial leaf spot and matures in about 85 days and gives an average yield of 1.25 tonnes/ha. Urdbean KU 300 developed through pedigree selection from T 9 × 7378/2 has been identified for Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. It has showed resistance to yellow mosaic virus and is suitable for spring with an average yield of 1.1 tonnes/ha. Crop Production Sulphur at 20 kg/ha, half as basal and half as side-dressing increased grain yield by 20% over full dose as basal.
