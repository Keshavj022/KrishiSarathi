It is observed that the total food grains was 50.8 million units in the year 1950-51, it has increased to 315.7 million units in the year 2021-22. It is more than six times. Really is a remarkable feature. It is also found that the sugar cane production of trend also recorded tremendously in the year 2021-22 has 431.8 million units. It has increased more than seven times from the period 1950-51 to 2021-22. Unfortunately in case of Jowar crop there was decreasing trend from the period 1992-97 to 2021- 22.
