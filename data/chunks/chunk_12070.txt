 Validation and commercialization:   The technology was tested at two AICRP-BioControl centres, UAS-Raichur, Karnataka and RARS, ANGRAU, Anakapalli, Andhra Pradesh for two years.   Toxicology data has been generated for CIBRC registration and commercialization. 5. Whether licensed to private companies, If yes, details thereof: No 6. Benefits: Soil application of 250kg of M. anisopliae, (ICAR-NBAIR Ma-4) enriched Farmyard manure per hectare (2.5 x 1011 spores/hectare) two times in a year (June/July & July/August) effectively reduced the grub population by 75-96% leading to reduced plant damage and increased yield (33-62%). 7.

Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/ species): Metarhizium anisopliae ICAR-NBAIR Ma 35 strain has been identified as a promising microbial biocontrol agent for management of recent invasive pest, Fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda in Maize. Talc formulation (2% W. P) and oil formulation have been developed with shelf life of 12 months. It is ecologically safe and do not have any deleterious effects on non-target organisms, other living organisms in the environment, unlike chemical insecticides. 2. Target crops and delivery system: Maize Foliar application of talc/oil Formulations. 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): All 4. Validation and commercialization:   The technology was tested at ICAR-NBAIR experimental farm at Yelahanka, Bangalore, Karnataka and AICRP Bio Control center-RARS, ANGRAU, Anakapalli, Andhra Pradesh for two years.   Multi-locational testing is under progress.   Toxicology data has to be generated for commercialization. 5. Whether licensed to private companies, If yes, details thereof: No 6. Benefits: Three foliar sprays of Metarhizium anisopliae ICAR-NBAIR Ma 35 at the dose of 5g/ ml/liter containing 1 x 108cfu/ml at 10 days interval after 20, 30 and 40 days after sowing showed 33-76% reduction in plant damage caused by fall armyworm in maize with an increased yield of 38-53%. 7.
