PRODUCTIVITY OF CROPS • Crops yield data of all the Alfisols sites revealed that continuous application of N alone over a long period resulted, reduction in yield. Below control treatment (nothing was applied). At Palampur, the productivity of maize and wheat in the N alone plot is badly affected and in the recent years there is no crop in this particular plot (Table 3 and Plate 1). Thus, the results clearly brought out that application of N alone in Alfisols is detrimental. Table 3.

However, incorporation of FYM and in‐situ green manuring resulted appreciable increase in yield of both kharif and rabi rice. 100% NPK+FYM PLATE‐1 100% N PLATE‐2 Plate 1.
