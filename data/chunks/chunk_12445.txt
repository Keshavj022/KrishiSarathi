 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 189   Focus on production of pulses by utilization of rice fallows and intercropping with coarse cereals, oilseeds and commercial crops   Nutrient management based on Soil Health Cards (SHCs) need to be adopted extensively, as it can bring down cultivation costs by 10-25%, particularly on fertilizers.   The efficiency in input use can bring down the cost of production and enhance the farm incomes. Cost reduction technologies such as RCTs like zero tillage (reduces the cost to the tune of Rs. 3400/ha), rational use of resources (seeds, fertilizers and water) through diversification and adoption of conservation agriculture, bed planting in wheat, micro irrigation techniques like drip and sprinkler are recommended as it can save about 25 per cent seed, 30 per cent water and 25 per cent nitrogen leading to higher use efficiencies. Besides, solar-energy-based tubewells to be provided to farmers to bring down their input costs of energy.   There should be separate solar and water grids for agriculture to ensure availability on sustainable basis   An integrated multi-enterprise model consisting of diverse components (field and horticultural crops, fishery, cattle, poultry and beekeeping) can substantially cut the production costs by synergistic recycling of resources among different components and enhance the returns due to complementarities.   Potential of horticulture including mushroom cultivation, bee keeping can be harnessed through   adoption of cluster approach. Cultivar of guava, i.e. Hisar Safeda and Hisar Surkha and Gola, Ilaichi, Umran for ber are very popular and have vase potential for enhancing the returns of the farmers in the State and in the neighbouring states.   Haryana has popular world class Murraha buffalo breed and has good potential for export of quality germ plasm. Further, Possibility to import of Gir semen from Brazil may be explored. In addition, livestock championships, yield competitions and mini dairies may be encouraged through better incentives. Farmers may be encouraged to import high quality germplasm of livestock. Emphasis should be put on conservation and improvement of indigenous cows.   Marketing is the key to success in farming. Creating the market linkages by establishing terminal   markets, direct sale by farmers to the consumers through Apni Mandi/Kisan Bazars, and cooperative marketing, specialized markets for the perishable commodities, quality control and pledged storage and warehousing facilities, establishment of multi- commodity agro-processing centres/complexes in production catchments, efficient value chain, establishment of food quality testing laboratory and standards will certainly help in enhancing the farmers’ income.
