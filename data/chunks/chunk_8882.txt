 At Parbhani in medium black soil, 2 irrigations each of 6 cm depth scheduled at flowering and pod development stages produced 1.91 tonnes/ha seed yield of pigeonpea (Cv. BSMR 736). Ridge and furrow after two rows with irrigation in each furrow performed better over other treatments. At Parbhani, 2 irrigations each of 6 cm depth at flowering and pod stages produced 1.64 tonnes/ha seed grain yield of chickpea (Cv. ICCV 2). DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001â€“2002 78 yield of onion (Cv N 53) with recommended doses of NPK. In potato 6 irrigations each of 6 cm depth scheduled at fixed 10 days interval produced 30.1 tonnes/ha maximum tuber yield (Cv Kufri Chandramukhi) which performed better over IW/ CPE approach. Two post sowing irrigations each of 6 cm depth scheduled at 80 and 120 DAS produced 1.03 tonnes/ha seed and 0.4 tonne/ha root yield of ashwagandha. At Kota one irrigation of 6 cm depth produced 0.82 tonne/ha root yield of ashwagandha with 30 kg N/ha. At Chiplima, 21 irrigations each of 6 cm depth to autumn planted sugarcane scheduled at IW/CPE=1.2 produced 129.4 tonnes/ha cane yield. Pressurised Irrigation Methods at different Centres At Belvatagi (loamy clay soil) drip irrigation at 100% PE produced 15.7 tonnes/ ha yield of curry leaf under normal planting and scheduling at 75% PE and 60% wetted area consumed about 40.3 water/tree/day producing 14 kg/pomegranate tree (Cv Jyothi) which is 71% higher over surface irrigation method and saved 20% irrigation water. At Bhavanisagar, drip irrigation to tapioca at 75 mm CPE produced 50.4 tonnes/ ha tuber yield requiring 54.3 cm irrigation water and micro-sprinkler irrigation at 80% PE on alternate day, registered maximum pod yield (3.60 tonnes/ha) in summer Groundnut (Cv BS-9706). At Madurai, old coconut plantation produced 180 nuts/ tree under drip irrigation at 100% PE. Whereas cane yield of ratoon sugarcane (147 tonnes/ha) was obtained through drip irrigation at 60% PE at an interval of 3 days requiring 114 cm of irrigation water with 29% saving. Summer groundnut scheduled at 100% PE produced optimum pod yield of 2.72 tonnes/ha. At Navsari, drip irrigation to tuberose at 80% PE produced 4.22 lakh spikes/ha, which is 66% higher over surface method. At Rahuri paired row planted cotton produced 3.0 tonnes/ha kapas yield under drip irrigation and saved 26% and produced 21.4 tonnes/ha tuber yield of potato. SOIL SALINITY AND COASTAL ECOSYSTEM Mapping Saline and Waterlogged Soils in Central Haryana Using Remote Sensing and GIS Extent of saline and waterlogged soils in Haryana were mapped using remote sensing Landsat TM data. Digital image processing techniques for different classes were identified with an average accuracy level of 85.6 per cent. The study showed that surface accumulated white salt crystals are a prominent indicator for the detection and correlation of salinity during the dry season. Waterlogged soils have been mapped into two categories, viz. submerged soils and waterlogged soils.
