 Keywords: Area, Millets, Production, Yield I NDIA is the leading producer and consumer of millet crops and their products. The people in arid and semi-arid regions of the country grow and consume millets as a staple food. Millets provide food and fodder security to the dryland agricultural communities. They are also being recognized as food grains for nutrition and health, and nearly organic in cultivation. Millets are the most secure crops to small farmers as they are the hardiest, resilient and climate adaptable crops in harsh, hot (up to 50°C) and drought environments. They are often the last standing crops in drought seasons and will be the sustainable future food source amidst of worsening climatic conditions. Current international scenario Millets are mainly grown in tropical, sub-tropical and slightly temperate regions of the world, with Asia and Africa accounting for major production and consumption centres. Sorghum and proso millet (common millet) are most widespread being cultivated in 112 and 35 countries respectively during 2019 (FAOSTAT database, http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/). Global production of millet is about 97.75 million tonnes from 78.43 million hectares area. Sorghum and pearl millet comprise more than 90% of the area and production. The rest of the production includes finger millet, proso millet, foxtail millet and other non-segregated millets. Sorghum is most widespread in terms of the total area covered by the countries, which is spread all over the globe. The top 5 countries comprise Sudan, Nigeria, India, Niger and the USA possess 57% of the global area under sorghum with about 45% of global sorghum production. While Sudan has a maximum area of 7.141 million ha, the USA contributes the maximum production of 10.9 million tonnes. Average yield of sorghum in India is 1064 kg/ha which is much less than that of the world average of 1460 kg/ha (Table 1). Pearl millet is cultivated in 36 countries in Africa, though India is the single largest country in terms of area (31.5%) and production (46.7%). Niger comes second with 24.3% area and 15.3% of production. The yield levels of India (1237 kg/ha) are much higher than the world average of 834 kg/ha. Finger millet is cultivated in 14 countries; the top 5 countries, viz. India, Indian Farming 73 (01): 16-18; January 2023 Table 1.

Ethiopia has the highest yield level (2301 kg/ha). The yield in India is slightly higher than the global yield. Foxtail millet is a predominant crop of China with a production of 2.
