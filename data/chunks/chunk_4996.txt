Seedlings at 35 days were transplanted during fourth week of July in randomized block design by using 3 replications. Observations on dead- heart and white ear formation were taken after 10 days of each treatment application. Soil sample of 30 cm length Ð² 30 cm width 50 cm depth was collected from each replication after harvest for recording earthworm population. An experiment was also conducted in the Aralkocha village with 10 farmers; each with 3 treatments, i.e. application of parasi leaves @ 150 kg/ha, application of carbofuran granules @ 1 kg/ ha, and untreated control. Due to scanty rainfall during the initial part of this season, transplanting was delayed to first and second week of August. Stem borer moth did not appear till September, though the treatments were imposed at 30 DAT. Another application of treatments was made at 60 DAT. Observations on insect population/m 2, white ear/m 2 and grain yield were recorded. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Information available from the farmers using parasi leaves revealed that about 23% of them use leaves @ 75 kg/ha, 50% use 100 kg/ha and rest of the farmers use 150 kg/ha to control yellow stem-borer in rice. Data presented in Table 1 show that farmers using 75 kg parasi leaves /ha get nearly 55%, reduction in yellow stem borer damage, whereas about 63% reduction is obtained with 100 kg/ha. Maximum reduction of 75% is obtained with application of leaves @ 150 kg/ha. Even insecticide application was inferior to parasi leaf treatment, showing only about 60% reductions. Higher yield is obtained in parasi treatments, which is even more than double than the untreated one. Experiment Data obtained from the field experiment conducted at Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI) farm showed that the dead heart formation was very less, remaining less than 6% in all the treatments, including untreated control plot after 30 and 60 days of treatment (Table 2). This may be attributed to low insect population during this Table 2.
