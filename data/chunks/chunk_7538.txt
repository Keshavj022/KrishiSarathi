 Bhagwa, Super Bhagwa, Ganesh, G-137, Ruby, Mridula, Arkata and Jalore seedless was evaluated. Maximum plant spread north to south × east to west was recorded in Ruby followed by G-137 and Arkata. Based on the study, cultivar Ruby and Super Bhagwa were found suitable for cultivation in Bundelkhand region. Twelve spray type cultivars of chrysanthemum were evaluated for different growth and flowering parameters. White Star and Karnal Pink were found promising for the region. Extension Front Line Demonstrations (329) were organized at farmer’s field on rapeseed–mustard (45), chickpea (10), groundnut (150), maize (80), rice (17), sesame (21), mung-bean (4) and pigeon pea (2) in Jhansi, Datia, Tikamgarh and Niwari districts. The results of FLDs in rapeseed-mustard convincingly proved that by adopting the improved production practices, farmers could get an average 26% increase in productivity (1,467 kg/ha) over indigenous practices (1,166 kg/ ha) with an average net monetary benefit of ` 12,069/ha. Improved technology provided farmers an alternative and better response in getting higher yield in chickpea. There was 20% of seed saving, optimum plant population and 27.3–40% higher yield advantage over farmer practices by using chickpea RVG-202. The net return (`/ha) using improved practices was ` 42,978/ ha in comparison to ` 28,528/ha by using farmer practices. Besides FLDs, several on-farm/off-farm demonstrations, field diagnostic surveys, field days and training programs were conducted for farmers to popularise scientific cultivation of various crops including pulses, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants. To facilitate reach of the farm advisory at the farmer’s door step, a dedicated Farmer’s Corner was incorporated in the University website (http:// www.rlbcau.ac.in/Farmers_corner.php).
