 The yield gap varied from 11% in linseed to 30% in bajra. Hence, there existed a vast potential for increasing the existing level of production by adopting improved technologies advocated for different agro-ecological situations. 250 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Table 1:- Potential for increasing the existing level of production Average yield at farm FLD yield (Kg/ha) Crops (Kg/ha) 2014-15 2014-15 Yield gap (%) Paddy 4534 5150 11.96 Sorghum 1392 1913 27.23 Bajra 1060 1525 30.49 Maize 5126 6001 14.58 Ragi 1985 2278 12.86 Wheat 2584 3169 18.46 Chickpea 766 913 16.10 Tur 2639 3141 15.98 Urad 501 593 15.51 Groundnut 1516 1838 17.52 Niger seed 250 306 18.30 Soybean 1540 1936 20.45 Sunflower 1406 1826 23.00 Linseed 731 821 10.96 Cotton 1365 1826 25.25 Sugarcane 2114 2499 15.41 Source: Annual Report 2015-16, ICAR-Agricultural Technology Application Research Institute, Bengaluru. Karnataka state is having second largest area under rainfed agriculture next only to Rajasthan. The State also is one of the most drought prone States of the country. For instance, of the 176 blocks, over140 were declared as drought hit during the year 2016-17. Despite this, the state has been contributing significantly to the nation’s food basket. However, farmers in general and those in particular engaged in rainfed agriculture are facing wide spread distress due to increase in cost of living and decreasing profitability. The impetuous being accorded to Doubling the Farmer‘s Income is very timely and the dire need of the hour especially in the State of Karnataka. There is ample scope as evidenced by several important studies that the farming is support by required inputs at affordable cost and the farmers realizes higher market prices for his produce, the goal of Doubling the Farmer‘s Income within the given time frame is very much achievable. Certain studies have shown that unless the farmers share in the consumer rupee increases from the current 22%-24% to an expected 55-60%, farming will remain an unprofitable proposition. However, realizing higher share for farmers in the consumer price is fraught with several challenges. 251 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Primarily it calls for major market reforms. Improved grading and processing infrastructure besides technology led weather forecasting, market intelligence and insurance. Improving production by adopting better planting materials and improved agricultural technology will enable to contribute approximately 30% to the farmer’s income. Another 30% of income contribution can be realized by adding value through grading, primary processing and cost reduction through improvement in input use efficiency.
