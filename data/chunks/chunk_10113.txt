Mandate and activities ICAR-CIBA undertakes R&D programmes for developing viable, eco-friendly and sustainable farming technologies for brackishwater finfish/shellfish species. The two centers at Kakdweep and Navsari located on the east and west coasts also undertake region-specific research and technology dissemination. • Basic, strategic and applied research for techno-economically viable and sustainable culture systems for finfish and shellfish in brackishwater. • Species and systems diversification in brackishwater aquaculture. • Act as a repository of information on brackishwater fishery resources with a systematic database. • Human Resource Development, capacity building and skill development through training, education and extension. 3. Salient achievements • Developed breeding and seed production technologies for commercially-important brackishwater finfish/shellfish including seabass, milkfish, pearlspot, grey mullet, mangrove snapper, silver moony, spotted scat, mystus catfish, mud crab and major shrimp species. • Developed grow-out technology for commercially-important brackishwater finfish/shellfish species. Further, standardized biofloc-based seed rearing and grow-out technologies for commercially-important shrimps. • Developed cost-effective, functional and grow-out feeds for different life stages of the economically-important brackishwater species. • Developed cost-effective kits for disease diagnosis and water quality assessment, and microbial products for aquatic health management. • Decoded whole genome of Indian white shrimp, grey mullet and important microbes. • Prepared GIS-based maps for potential sites for brackishwater aquaculture. 173 Fisheries Science 173 4.
