 A comparative study of productivity of major crops was done in all the districts of the state in order to develop a clear insight of the major gap lying between them and a detailed study was done to know the reasons behind them. The average yield of major crops of the state along with highest and lowest yield along with the districts are given in Table 1.1. It is clear from the data that a big gap lies between highest and lowest yield and needs an eagle eye approach to bridge them.

Given below are the most notable constraints of major crops like rice, jowar, maize, oilseeds, pulses, livestock and fisheries. Major constraints in achieving the demonstrated yield in Rice   Major biotic stresses like Brown Plant Hopper, Stem borer, Bacterial Leaf Blight, Stem Rot, Sheath Blight, Red Stripe and Leaf & Neck Blast.   Abiotic stresses like frequent floods during vegetative to flowering stage, increased salinity levels in the soil and stress due to heat and cold.   Damage due to natural calamities like cyclones and heavy rains coinciding with harvest and prolonged cloudy weather during Kharif season.   Lack of small scale farm machinery for various operations including post harvest handling suitable for small and marginal farmers.   Lack of efficient or proper spraying equipment.   Acute shortage of labour during peak operations leading to delay in timely operation and escalation of cost of production.   Wide spread cultivation of non climate resilient rice varieties   Deterioration of soil fertility and productivity.   Indiscriminate / imbalanced use of fertilizers and pesticides   Improper drainage in low lying areas of rice cultivation.
