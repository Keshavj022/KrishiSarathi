Distribution of Cationic parameters Calcium (Ca2+) is dissolved into subsurface water by weathering and disintegration of limestone (CaCO3), which is one of the primary factors for water quality. Its concentration value varies between 22 mg/L to 206 mg/L, with a mean concentration of 86 mg/L. The standard range of Ca2+ is 100 mg/L, which exceeds 25 % of groundwater samples (n = 24). The Mg2+ content of groundwater fluctuates between 9 mg/L to 161 mg/L. In 30 % of groundwater samples (n = 28), it surpasses the limit of 50 mg/L (Adhikary et al., 2010) in irrigation water. One of the main causes of Mg2+ in groundwater is the presence of ferromagnesium minerals in aquifer petrology (garnet, hypersthene, hornblende, apatite, and biotite) apart from anthropogenic sources (septic tank leakage and domestic drainage water disposal). High levels Ca2+ and Mg2+ increase soil permeability, leading to higher crop production (Singh et al., 2018). Sodium (Na+) levels fluctuate between 19 mg/L to 300 mg/L and potassium (K+) levels fluctuate between from 2 mg/L to 40 mg/L with an average concentration of 14 mg/L. In 94 % (n = 88) and 60 % (n = 56) of groundwater sample are above 50 mg/L and 10 mg/L limits of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) levels for irrigation water quality (IWQ) (Aravinthasamy et al., 2020). Plagioclase feldspars in granites breaks down to release sodium into the aquifer system, which also comes from artificial activities such as the home sewage seepage from septic tanks, agriculture operations, etc (Subramani et al., 2005; Rao et al., 2021; Subba Rao et al. 2024). An anthropogenic source of K+ is un­ controlled fertilizer, while orthoclase feldspars in granitic rocks act as a geogenic source (Karunanidhi et al., 2021a; Subba Rao et al., 2021). Elevated sodium and potassium levels leads to reduced soil permeability as well as agricultural productivity (Ali and Ali, 2018). 3.1.3. Distribution of Anionic parameters Bicarbonate (HCO3 –) content ranges from 48 gm/l to 576 mg/L, with an average concentration of 237.5 mg/L. Around, 48 % (n = 45) of groundwater samples fall above 180 mg/L for irrigation water quality in the study area (Aravinthasamy et al., 2020). High HCO3 – factors deter­ mine water hardness and also reduce Ca2+ concentration in soil. Soil- derived CO2 seeps into groundwater and undergoes chemical reactions in aquifer systems to produce HCO3 – (Rufino et al.,2019). The average level of chloride (Cl−) is 156.3 mg/L with values varying between 16 mg/L and 512 mg/L. About 38 groundwater samples (40 %) surpass the limit of 100 mg/L, which is harmful to plants, reducing productivity and also decreases permeability of the soil (Yıldız and Karakus¸, 2020).
