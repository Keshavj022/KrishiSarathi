 Therefore, drones may become a major part of agriculture in the future by helping farmers manage their fields and resources in a better and sustainable way. But high initial costs and policy reforms are two difficult obstacles to overcome, to make it popular and farmer-friendly. Despite the limitations, these tools and technology are expanding rapidly with their use in agriculture by providing information about farming. *Corresponding author email: tushar.athare@icar.gov.in Outreach Programmes of KVKs (2018-19 to 2022-23) 0.5 4 3.76 0.41 0.4 0.35 0.37 0.37 3 0.32 0.3 2.04 2.17 > (1.83 0 1.95 0.2 0.1 1 0.0 0 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 = OFT (in lakh) = FLD (in lakh) Training Activities of KVKs (2018-19 to 2022-23) 18 16.82 16.9 16 ry 15.76 1.4 16 . 1.21 1413.06 13.51 42 1.14 ceils 12 1 a 0.8 8 0.6 6 4 0.4 2 0.2 0 0 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 @ Farmers trained (in lakh) Extension Personnel trained (in lakh) Seed and Planting Materials by KVKs (2018-19 to 2022-23) 490.97 500 459.49 ERED 365.53 348.01 0 | | | 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 @ Planting material produced (in lakh) 5 4.69 4.5 4.2 4 ag 3.49 3 2.87 2.5 2 16 1.7 147 17 1.86 1.5 1 0.5 (0) 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 @ Seed produced (in lakh quintal) By KVKs Indian Farming March 2024 09 Indian Farming 56 March 2024 Harmony in cultivation Expanding the reach of natural farming practices Harish M N1, A A Raut1, S R K Singh1* and Sanjana Shrivastava1 1ICAR-Agricultural Technology Application Research Institute, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh 482 004 In recent decades, the indiscriminate use of natural resources in Indian agriculture has resulted in environmental, social, and economic challenges for the planet Earth. Natural farming has emerged as a beacon of hope in modern agriculture, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional farming practices. In recent years, the importance of natural farming has garnered widespread attention due to its potential to address pressing challenges. At its core, natural farming emphasizes working in tandem with nature's rhythms rather than against them. By harnessing the inherent resilience and complexity of natural ecosystems, this approach seeks to nurture healthy soils, enhance biodiversity, and promote the well-being of farmers and communities. Recognizing the significance of natural farming, ICAR initiated a nationwide project titled â€˜Out-scaling of Natural Farming through KVKs, in 2022. In ATARI Zone-IX, the project is being implemented across 48 KVKs in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to promote and expand the adoption of natural farming practices via Krishi Vigyan Kendras. Within this initiative, the crucial components focused are promoting natural farming practices, capacity building for farmers, demonstrations and trials, scaling up, and knowledge sharing and documentation of natural farming practices.
