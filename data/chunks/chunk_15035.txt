 I rule out this mechanism with two pieces of evidence. First, I do not find any trend breaks for total village population by treatment status in Fig. 3, suggesting that village size remained stable. Second, I directly examine the impact of PMGSY on total household size in Column 1 of Appendix Table B5. I find no detectable impact at standard significance levels, suggesting that household size also remained stable. Journal of Development Economics 152 (2021) 102686 9 Y. Shamdasani Fig. 3. Pre-Trends. Panel A plots trends for two outcomes (village population and agricultural workers) over time for program-eligible villages and incidental villages in the REDS data in (a) and (b) respectively, and for program-eligible villages across India in (c). Means are constructed using village-level data from the 1991, 2001 & 2011 Indian Census Primary Census Abstracts. Panel B plots the estimated differences and 95% confidence intervals for night time luminosity in treatment villages relative to control villages in the years before and after the launch of PMGSY for program-eligible villages in (d) and incidental villages in the REDS data in (e).

Outcome in Columns (1)–(2) is an indicator that equals 1 if the household engages in any cultivation. Outcome in Columns (3)–(4) is the total number of person-days worked in the casual labor market for non- agriculture. For each outcome, I run the direct regressions in Panel A (Eq. (2) in first column, Eq. (6) in second column), the incidental regressions in Panel B (Eq. (4) in first column, Eq. (7) in second column), and the pooled regressions (Eq. (5) in first column, Eq. (8) in second column) in Panel C. Close is an indicator that equals 1 for villages within 10 kilometers of the nearest town at baseline. The 𝑝-value from a F-test of the joint significance of the two coefficients is reported at the bottom of each panel. Observations are weighted using 1999 sample weights.
