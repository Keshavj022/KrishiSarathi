 Privacy concerns are also pertinent, as the collec- tion and use of data, especially when involving third-party services, raise questions about data security. In terms of gaps in current research, scalability is a major area needing attention. There is a critical need for research focused on making smart sensor technologies more accessi- ble and affordable for smallholder farmers, as well as devel- oping scalable sensor systems that can be easily adapted to various farm sizes and types. Energy efﬁciency is another key area, with a need for energy-efﬁcient sensors and sustainable power solutions, such as solar-powered sensors, to ensure continuous operation in remote areas. Further research into sensor miniaturization is essential to ensure that sensors can be made smaller without compromising accuracy and functionality, facilitating broader adoption and integration. Long-term impact studies are necessary to validate the ben- eﬁts of smart sensor technologies and address any unintended consequences. Such studies should focus on the environmental and economic impacts of these technologies in precision agricul- ture. Integration with emerging technologies presents additional research opportunities. For instance, exploring the integration of blockchain technology can enhance secure data sharing and traceability in agricultural supply chains, while advancements in machine learning can improve predictive analytics and decision-making capabilities. Addressing these weaknesses and research gaps will be crucial for the continued advance- ment and successful implementation of smart sensor tech- nologies in precision agriculture. 7. Future Perspectives and Research Directions 7.1. Emerging Trends in Smart Sensor Technologies for Precision Agriculture. The future of smart sensor technologies for precision agriculture is promising, with several emerging trends that have the potential to transform agricultural prac- tices. The followings are some key perspectives and research directions. Journal of Sensors 21 Miniaturization and low-power sensors: Advancements in microelectronics and nanotechnology will lead to the devel- opment of smaller, low-power smart sensors. These miniatur- ized sensors will be more cost-effective, easier to deploy, and will consume less energy, making them suitable for wide- spread adoption in precision agriculture. IoT integration: Smart sensors will become an integral part of the IoT ecosystem in agriculture. Integrating sensors with IoT platforms will enable seamless data communication, real-time monitoring, and remote control of agricultural pro- cesses, enhancing overall farm management efﬁciency [53]. Wireless sensor networks: Research will focus on devel- oping robust wireless sensor networks to address connectivity challenges in remote or rural farming areas. These networks will ensure continuous data transmission, enabling timely decision-making and reducing data loss.
