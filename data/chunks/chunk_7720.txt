 Buffalo oocytes were collected from abattoir ovaries and subsequently in vitro matured. These oocytes were subjected to pronase treatment for removal of zona pellucidae. Zona free oocyte was placed at right angle to cut the portion having nucleus. The enucleated cytoplasm from oocytes was used for reprogramming of donor cell nuclear material for development of cloned embryo. Activation of oocytes with chemicals electro-fusion is required to produce cloned embryos. Goat Cryopreservation of semen: Semen was extended with tris-egg yolk-egg yolk 7.5% (v/v) and glycerol 5.4% (v/v) was added in fructose diluent as extracellular and intracellular cryoprotectant. Semen samples having mass motility >4 and progressive motility >70% were used. Sperm concentrations were adjusted to 1×108/ml and diluted semen was equilibrated at 5°C for 4 h before being frozen. Post thaw motility in Jamunapari, Barbari, Jakhrana and Sirohi were 55.26±3.54, 55.74±2.84, 50.16±3.12, 50.62±2.32%, respectively by AI. About 10,000 doses of semen of different breed were preserved for further use. Neonatal colibacillosis in goat-kids: A therapeutic phage preparation containing three phages with highest lytic ranges (53, 48 and 46%) was formulated for the treatment of diarrhoeic neonatal goat- kids, caused by E. coli. The treatment was effective in 50% of diarrhoeic kids. Developed therapeutic phage preparation could be used with other alternatives such as herbal therapy for the enhanced efficacy to combat antibiotic resistant E. coli infections. A thermo-comfortable model shed for dairy cows Livestock housing plays an important role in buffering the effects of external environment on animals’ body. A thermo-comfortable model shed was established at Eastern Regional Station, Kalyani for amelioration of thermal stress and to provide better housing comfort to cows. Thermo-comfortable shed was made up of thatched roof with ridge ventilation roofing design. The main axis orientation of the shed was East-West direction. Owing to changes in roofing material, design and axis orientation, the micro environment of presently developed cow-shed became cooler, more ventilated, thermal radiation protective and comfortable than the existing traditional asbestos roofed cow-shed. The microclimatic conditions of the experimental shed were compared to existing shed having asbestos roof. Over all floor surface temperature of thermo-comfortable shed was 0.68 to 2.33°C lesser in morning and 1.33 to 4.05°C in afternoon. The ceiling surface temperature was 6.10 to 12.28°C lesser than that of existing shed in morning and 3.87° to 10.53°C in afternoon. The average respective daily environmental temperature and humidity in the morning were 0.80° to 1.52°C and 0.4 to 2.29% lesser in experimental shed compared to existing shed. The corresponding values in the afternoon were 1.34 to 2.03°C and 1.00 to 2.23%.
