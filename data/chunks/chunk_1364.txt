 Farmers involved in the demonstration earned approximately `34,000 from 0.4 ha and utilized surplus grain for family consumption. This program has significantly improved farmers’ livelihoods, motivating them to adopt QPM cultivation across the region. Keywords: Farmer income, Food security, Kupwara, Livestock fodder, LQMH-1, Quality protein maize M AIZE is an important staple food in many countries and one of the highest-yielding crops globally, making it highly significant. Zea mays, commonly known as maize or corn, belongs to the Poaceae family and is often referred to as Indian corn or corn. As a C4 plant, maize has a brief growth season and is highly efficient in converting solar energy to dry matter due to its high nutritional requirements and C4 photosynthetic pathway. The female inflorescence, or ears, are well-protected by leaves and become visible only when the pale yellow silks emerge through the whorl of leaves. Maize has various types, including dent corn for feed and consumption, flint corn for cornmeal, sweet corn as a vegetable, popcorn, and waxy corn for industrial uses. Besides food, maize is essential in animal feed and biofuel production, showcasing its adaptability and wide applications. Challenges Maize is widely cultivated in Jammu and Kashmir, especially in the Kandi, Karewa, and plains, where it thrives in sandy loam to loamy soils. It is grown across nearly all districts in the Union Territory, with the Kupwara district leading in cultivation, covering approximately 18,000 ha. A significant challenge in maize cultivation is the low seed replacement rate due to the limited availability of improved seeds, creating a demand-supply gap. The introduction of quality protein maize aims to enhance both the nutritional and economic status of maize farmers. Initiative A frontline demonstration on the 'Introduction and Popularisation of Quality Protein Maize Variety LQMH-1' was conducted by KVK Kupwara in collaboration with DARS Rangreth, SKUAST-Kashmir at Gushi, Batergam, and Bramri villages in Kupwara district. Farmers achieved a yield of 70 q/ha from the demonstration, compared to 30 q/ha from traditional practices. Cultivation of quality protein maize has proven remunerative, providing high economic returns and nutritious fodder for cattle. The variety LQMH- 1 was introduced during the kharif season of 2023 and further demonstrated in 2024 on farmers’ fields in Gushi, Batergam, and Bramri. The demonstrations were conducted on a 1 ha area under the supervision of KVK- Kupwara and DARS, Rangreth, Srinagar. Outcome The farmer produced 28 quintals of maize grain from 0.4 ha. The stover was cut into pieces using a chaff cutter and used as cattle fodder. The additional grain was processed into flour for household consumption.
