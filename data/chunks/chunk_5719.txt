Talashilkar et al. (2001) 107 INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE S. No. Title of ITK Details of ITK and rationale Reference 51 Nutrient management practices of Andaman and Nicobar Islands Fertilizer consumption in Andaman and Nicobar Islands is very low because of fragile environment, poor socio- economic status and small-land holdings of farmers. Farmers have been using indigenous technologies to meet the nutrient requirement of crops. Among these, biomass waste incorporation, weed incorporation, green leaf manuring from live fences and growing leguminous cover crops in plantations are very common. In rice-based cropping system, green leaf manuring, weed incorporation and application of FYM and poultry manure are common (Andaman and Nicobar Islands). Ganeshamurthy et al.(2001) 52 Nutrient management practices of some eco-regions of West Bengal plains In the plain lands of West Bengal, farmers follow a large number of indigenous nutrient management practices based on traditional wisdom derived from the experience of earlier generation over a period of several centuries. Some of these methods are preparation of FYM, in-situ decomposition of grasses and weeds, water hyacinth compost, application of oilcake, tank silt application, crop rotation and penning of sheep (West Bengal). Ghosh et al. (2001) 53 Technologies for nutrient management of coastal Karnataka As an indigenous approach, farmers use river silt, burnt soil, FYM and compost, besides rock phosphate to meet the nutrient needs of crops quite apart from maintenance of soil health. Several farmers in the coastal region practice indigenous nutrient management per se to grow paddy and some horticultural crops despite the low levels of crop yield (Karnataka). Badrinath et al.
