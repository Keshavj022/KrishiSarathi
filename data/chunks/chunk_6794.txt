 Patent granted for ‘Multi-use composition for biocontrol of plant pathogen infestation’: ICAR- National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack has identified two Trichoderma species having excellent quality to protect the rice plant from the soil and seed-borne diseases and excellent growth promotion capability. The research team developed a formulation with these two species individually and in combination and tested in farmers’ fields. These formulations were observed to be highly effective in different crops including maize, finger millet, niger and rice. It was observed that using these formulations, the farmers were able to harvest 10–20% higher yield with lower input. Besides reducing the use of chemical fungicides, it also reduces the input of chemical fertilizers. The inventors filed a patent based on the formulation on ‘A multi-use composition for biocontrol of plant pathogen infestation, and growth Enhancement’ which has been granted recently by the Indian Patent Office on 3 December, 2021 (Patent No. 383679). Management of leaf blight/wilt in Rajasthan: The disease can be controlled with the combined practice involving (1) Seed treatment with tebuconazole 2 DS @1.5 g/kg/seed; (2) Four rows of bajra in between groundnut (6 groundnuts: 4 bajra: 6 groundnuts per plot) with 43.0% decrease of disease over control having 506 I.C.B.R.; (3) Application of neem cake @200 kg/ha (Basal) with 20.3% decrease of disease over control having 2.0 of I.C.B.R and soil application of Trichoderma powder 10 kg/ha at basal, 30, 55 and 75 DAS with 24.0% decrease of disease over control having 7.4 I.C.B.R.; (4) Spraying of carbendazim 12% + mancozeb 63% WP (SAAF 75% WP) (10 g SAAF in 5 L water for 100 sq m area) with 20.5% decrease of disease over control having 22.7 of I.C.B.R.; (5) Tebuconazole 430 SC (@7.5 ml folicure in 5 L water for 100 sq m area) at 30, 55 and 75 DAS with 30.0% decrease of disease over control having 10.5 of I.C.B.R. Commercialization of Entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) biopesticide formulation technology: The ICAR-SBI, Tamil Nadu, EPN biopesticide formulation technology has been commercialized to 5 companies (Coordinated by Agrinnovate India, New Delhi) with a license fee of ₹10 lakhs. The 78 EPN strains belonging to tropical (49) and subtropical (29) are being maintained in the culture collection and 45 Significant reduction of BLB symptoms in phage treated rice plant leaves as compared to untreated control plants Electron micrograph of Bacteriophages: Myoviridae (A), Siphoviridae (B, C) Plaques of phage on overlay agar Crop Management icar annual report 2022-23 99 symbiotic bacteria of Photorhabdus spp. (26 Nos.) and Xenorhabdus spp. (19 Nos.) are also being regularly sub- cultured and stored in glycerine. Rice research for upland, coastal area and low- land ecology: During 2021, the 766 accessions of rice germplasm were maintained.
