Institutional Development 2.7.2.1. Promotion of academic excellence in critical/emerging areas 2.7.2.1.1. Faculty development Quality of education in most of the universities is adversely affected due to shortage of faculty, little opportunities for faculty development and aging/superannuating faculty. Only 65% of the sanctioned faculty strength remains filled and over 50% universities have over 30% vacant faculty positions. Average age of teaching faculty is around 50 years or higher. Out of tune, outdated and old faculty restricts creative and forward looking innovative ideas on improving the content, context and pedagogy of education. 16 In order to boost teaching and learning in the emerging themes of science and technology, teachers need continuous encouragement and assistance to improve their competence in relevant subject areas. Two types of training of teachers, in India and abroad, are considered: (i) relatively of longer duration (3 to 6 months) in priority theme areas and (ii) continuing life-long learning in the form of refresher courses of shorter duration (20 to 30 days) in educational technology and the subject domain of a teacherâ€™s expertise. 2.7.2.1.1.1.
