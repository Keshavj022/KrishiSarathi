Rajan and Sethuraman (1997) 442 Calotropis reduces swelling Swelling on any part of the cattleâ€˜s body occurs due to injury, microbial infection, or intake of any poisonous compound. This swellling can also cause problems in other system of animal. Like, the digestive power of the animal decreases and blood circulation also decreases. The swelling is prominent in the areas below the knee joint of the animal and also in the neck region. Swelling on the leg causes the animal to limp slowly. Two kg of bark or leaves or leaves of akada (Calotropis gigantea) is boiled and made into paste. This paste is smeared on the swollen region after cooling. This remedy is so effective that if the paste is smeared just once, the swelling recedes within two to three days (Banaskantha, Gujarat).

(2000) 444 Use of karela for healing wounds Karela (Momordica charantia) is used to cure wounds infested by external parasites. Karela is cut into small pieces without peeling the skin and the pieces are crushed till the paste becomes soft like an ointment. The paste is stored in a separate container. The affected parts are cleaned and buffalo milk is poured on them. The milk lures the worms to come out on the surface. These are picked and removed. The wound is cleaned with cloth or cotton and the karela paste is applied on it. The treatment is repeated twice a day in the morning and evening (Mehsana, Gujarat).
