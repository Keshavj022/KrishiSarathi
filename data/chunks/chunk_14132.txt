 After 3 days, profenofos degradation was estimated at 96 %, consistent with the observed 95 % dissipation. This supports the conclusion that biodegradation, rather than photolysis, was the primary dissipation process, although volatilisation may have also contributed to profenofos dissipation. To further estimate the contributions of dissipation processes of profenofos over time, a modelling approach was developed. The soil- specific model aligned well with the observed profenofos concentra­ tions and isotope compositions in the plot (Fig. 5a). However, the discrepancy between the reported profenofos application rate (244 mg. m-²) and the measured topsoil mass three hours post-application (78 mg. m-²) could not be fully explained by photolysis, volatilisation, or biodegradation kinetics derived from laboratory experiments. Off-site transport via runoff or leaching was unlikely within the first two days post-application. Similar discrepancies in recovery have been attributed to drift and variability associated with manual spraying [58]. To address this, a correction factor was applied to the reported application rate, aligning the model with the initial soil measurements. The corrected model confirmed rapid profenofos dissipation in the soil, with a simu­ lated T1/2 of 1.3 ± 0.4 d, consistent with the observed T1/2 of 1.1 ± 0.6 d. By incorporating laboratory-derived εC values for biodegradation and photolysis, the model predicted an increase in δ13C to Δδ13C = +2.0 ‰ (ranging from + 0.8 to + 4.4 ‰; IC 95 %) by day 3, which matched the observed Δδ13C of + 2.7 ± 0.8 ‰. A detailed analysis of model outputs allowed for the differentiation of dissipation processes, confirming that biodegradation was the dominant process, accounting for 90.5 % (from 87.0 % to 92.1 %; IC 95 %), with photolysis contrib­ uting only 7.6 % (IC 95 % < 0.2 %), and volatilisation with only 0.05 % (IC 95 % < 0.02 %) by day 7. The model results also confirmed the low profenofos sorption in soil, with less than 0.3 % in the non-extractable fraction 34 days post- application (Fig. 5b). Additionally, the predicted low leaching poten­ tial (< 0.02 %) was consistent with the absence of profenofos (< LOD) in passive samplers (POCIS) deployed in groundwaters beneath the field Fig. 4.
