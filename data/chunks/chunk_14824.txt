 The climate-water balance (water surplus or deficit) was calculated using: Di = Pi −EToi (1) where Di and Pi are the moisture deficit (mm) and precipitation (mm) in month i, respectively; and EToi is the reference crop evapotranspiration, generally calculated using a simple climatic water balance, and it is expressed as: ETo = 16K (10T I )m (2) where the ETo is the reference crop evapotranspiration, K is a constant, T is the monthly temperature, I is the heat index, and m is a coefficient dependent on I. The values of Di can be aggregated for a given period by considering the accumulation of the water balance during that period. Dk i = ∑k−1 j=0 Di−j (3) where, k is the aggregation (accumulation) period, and i is the observed month. SPEI can be calculated as the standardised value of the log-logistic probability distribution function of the D series. f(x) = β α (x −y α )β( 1 + (x −y α )β )−2 (4) where α, β and y are the scale, shape, and origin parameters for D values in the range (y > D < ∞). Therefore, the log-logistic distribution func­ tion adopted for the standardized D series for all time scales is provided by: F(x) = [{ 1 + ( α x −y )β } ]−1 (5) where F(x) value transforms to a normal variable through the following approximation: SPEI = W −C0 + C1 + w + C2w2 1 + d1+d2w2+d3w3 (6) W = ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ −2ln(P) √ P ≤0.5(7) where P is the probability of exceeding determined by the D value as P = 1–F(x). If P > 0.5, then P is replaced by 1–P and the sign for SPEI is reversed. Moreover, C0, C1, C2, d1, d2, and d3 are constants determined to be the following: C0 = 2.515517, C1 = 0.802853, C2 = 0.010328, d1 = 1.432788, d2 = 0.189269, and d3 = 0.001308. The average SPEI value is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. Since SPEI is a standardized variable, SPEI values for different time and spaces can be compared to each other (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010a). An SPEI of 0 indicates 50% of the cumulative probability of D. As SPEI is a standardised value, it can be categorised by the dryness/wetness grade shown in Table 2. Based on this SPEI intensity scale, drought events are categorized as near normal, moderate, severe, and extreme droughts. Similarly, wet events are categorised into moderately, severely, and extremely wet for the respective positive values. That is, SPEI represents the severity of the dry and wet periods. A time-series analysis was performed to identify the occurrences of these dry (droughts) and wet (flood) events. Major droughts and floods-like episodes over the selected time frame in the GRB area were identified, and the respective impacts of droughts on crop production were then investigated. Drought risk assessment To appropriately define the drought risk, it is essential to identify the drought hazard extent, drought exposure, and drought vulnerability.
