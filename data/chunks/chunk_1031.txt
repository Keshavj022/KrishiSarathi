The damage is more when temperature increase is in combination with various other kinds of biotic and abiotic stress factors. Crops that perform better under adverse and less favourable environmental conditions are the way out and pearl millet is a crop that fits in perfectly. It is a nutrient rich and climate resilient crop that can ensure increased income as well as food and nutritional security to the farming populations in arid and semi-arid regions of the globe. Keywords: Climate resilience, Drought, Heat stress, Salinity S CIENTIFIC predictions are realised and the globe is witnessing climatic variations characterised by an increasing temperature, extreme variations in rainfall patterns, frequent droughts and diurnal temperature variations. Global climate change is expected to increase the temperature in the range of 1.5 to 5.8°C by the end of 2100 and crop yields are predicted to decrease approximately 10% for every one-degree increase in temperature.
