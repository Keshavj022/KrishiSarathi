 Days required to initiate flowering The summer bending of branches (Table 4) produced early initiation of flowering (33.6 days) than autumn bending (41.5 days). Early initiation of flowers was also recorded with other treatments during summer season of bending. Days required for fruit set Fruit set was also advanced by 20 days during summer season of bending (46.6 days) than autumn bending (64.1 days). Earliness in fruit setting was also noticed in other treatments during summer season of bending (Table 3).

Control plants produced the maximum pair of leaves/shootlet at flowering time (7.6) during summer season. Least pair of leaves was produced in autumn bending of branches (T1=4.8). Number of shootlets with flower buds/branch Inspite of having more number of shootlets/branch in plants (Table 3) with summer bending recorded less number of shootlets with flower buds per branch. During summer bending of branch, many newly emerged shoots become vegetative instead of reproductive. High temperature with high humidity during summer has a deleterious effect on the production of reproductive shoots. It was also noticed that if rainy days continued for 2 to 3 days after bending operation, the newly emerged shootlet made excess growth and became vegetative in nature. These vegetative shoots should be removed. Number of flowers per shootlet The autumn bending of branches produced maximum number of flowers/shootlet (7.5), followed by T2 (6.9) and T3 (5.8) during the same season (Table 3). Variation was not conspicuous in respect of number of flowers/shootlet among the treatments, which ranged from 6.8 to 7.2 during summer season of bending.
