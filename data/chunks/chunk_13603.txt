 In other words, the adoption pattern of primary beneﬁciaries of capacity-building programs was similar to that of non-beneﬁciaries (before such program interven- tions). The coefﬁcient of interest, a3, shows that primary beneﬁcia- ries had a 26 % higher adoption rate than non-beneﬁciaries, suggesting that KVKs’ capacity-building program interventions increased adoption of HD-2967. When we include a time-varying district control in Column 2, the coefﬁcient a3 is marginally higher (29 % versus 26 %) than in Column 1, which suggests the estimates are not upward-biased. We perform the falsiﬁcation test in Column 3 by testing whether pre-intervention trends exist across primary beneﬁciaries and non-beneﬁciaries.34 The coefﬁcient a3 is insigniﬁ- cant, suggesting a similar trend across primary beneﬁciaries and non-beneﬁciaries in the absence of any capacity-building program interventions. Overall, the above ﬁndings show that both KVK inter- ventions—frontline demonstrations and capacity-building programs —positively impact technology adoption. 5.2. Estimating network beneﬁciaries About 10 % of farmers in these villages are primary or secondary beneﬁciaries of frontline demonstrations, of whom 3 % are farmers with such demonstrations on their ﬁelds (primary beneﬁciaries), and 7 % are farmers who report accessing such demonstrations by visiting another farmer’s ﬁeld (secondary beneﬁciaries). Eqs. (3) and (4) estimate the percentage of network beneﬁciaries in frontline demonstration villages (plotted in Fig. 4), and results show that 28 % of farmers are network beneﬁciaries of such demonstrations. Fig. 5 presents the percentage of network beneﬁ- ciaries of capacity-building programs conducted on varietal evalu- ations in capacity-building program villages: 27 % of farmers are network beneﬁciaries. Our estimates of network beneﬁciaries for both frontline demonstrations and capacity-building programs may have a downward bias because the study captures the Table 5 Estimates of FLDs’ impact on primary or secondary beneﬁciaries’ adoption of HD-2967, new wheat variety, Uttar Pradesh.

The dependent variable takes a value of 1 when wheat farmers adopt HD-2967 and 0 otherwise. Time is a dummy variable. In Models 1 and 2, it takes value 1 for 2017–18 and 0 for 2015–16. In Model 3, it takes a value of 1 for 2015–16 and 0 for 2014–15. In all models, FLD (P or S) takes a value of 1 if farmers beneﬁted from FLDs in 2016–17 (i.e.
