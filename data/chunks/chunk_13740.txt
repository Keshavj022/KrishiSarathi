 Methodology 3.1 Data Collection and Pre-Processing Introduction to Data: The historical rainfall data used in this study was taken from datasets which are published in between the years of 1901 to 2015. This chapter also includes information from several Indian meteorological regions. Data up to 2022 was added to the dataset to incorporate additional dynamics as well as allow for a more comprehensive understanding of long-term spatial and temporal changes. These changes can reveal underlying patterns and their causes. The process of collecting this data is also evolving. Source of Data: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) is the main source of meteorological data. IMD is used in this study. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall are some major characteristics of climate which were represented by this section of the study. Accurate and reliable meteorological data are crucial for climate studies since they support the validity of the analysis and forecasting models. Reanalysis Data: ECMWF ERA5 was used to fill the gaps in the IMD data in the reanalysis data set. For a few variables are including precipitation convective rate, cloud lumps and moisture divergence, and ERA5 data. Those are important and the reason is that it fills the gaps in observational data and offers new angles on the atmosphere. Data Pre-processing:  To ensure data completeness, missing values were addressed using imputation and interpolation techniques.  To ensure uniformity in the analysis, data normalization was done to standardize values across several meteorological divisions.  Important climate factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall were chosen as features to improve the forecasting models' accuracy. 3.2. Change Detection Using Pettitt Test Introduction to Pettitt Test: Pettitt test is a non-parametric statistic technique which is fundamentally employed in the searching of breakpoints quite similar to the way it is done with other graphical efforts. The same situation arises with shifts in the seasonal patterns within time series data. It is the most suited approach regarding trends in rainfall patterns among many situations of the same over a long period of time and without any restrictions on the assumption of the distribution of the data. Application of the Pettitt Test: ● The Pettitt test is applicable for rainfall time series data across various meteorological divisions in India. ● Significant change points were identified to indicate abrupt shifts in rainfall trends over the years. ● These shifts highlight periods of sudden climate variability which are crucial for understanding long-term trends. Example results: ● Changepoint in 1985 for Northwest India. ● Changepoint in 1995 for Central India. ● These analysed shifts help guide the analysis of historical rainfall patterns. ● The changepoint can also adjust as well as improve rainfall forecasting models. 3.
