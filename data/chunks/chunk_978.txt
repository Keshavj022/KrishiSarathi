 In puddled soil at a depth of 2–3 cm, 2–3 seedlings/ hill are transplanted in rows with spacing of 15 cm × 15 cm. Water management: At tillering, panicle initiation, flowering and grain filling, Boro rice should be irrigated. At 30 DAT (Days after transplanting), there should be standing water of 2–3 cm in the field. After transplanting, water level of 4–5 cm should be maintained for 30–40 days. About 3 cm of water should be maintained from panicle initiation to heading. After heading, there should be 2-day break before applying 2–3 cm of irrigation. Nutrient management: At first ploughing, organic manure should be applied @5 t/ha through FYM/compost. Based on soil test, inorganic fertilizer recommendation for high yielding Boro rice cultivars is 100-50-30 kg of N-P-K/ha. Basal application should consist of a full dose of P, 75% dose of K, and a 25% dose of N. Remaining N should be applied in two splits, with first 25% applied at the maximum tillering and 50% at panicle initiation. At panicle initiation, 25% potash dose should also be applied. Weed management: Generally, 2 hand weeding at 20 and 40 DAT is beneficial in reducing weed growth in Boro rice. Herbicides like Butachlor (Machete) 5% granule @30 kg/ha in 3–4 cm standing water during 2–4 DAT are sprayed to manage grassy weed in cases, where there is a lack of labour. If herbicide granules are not available, Butachlor in liquid form can be applied @1.5 kg a.i./ha mixed with 400 litres of water. Benthiocarb (Saturn) can be applied @1.5 kg a.i./ha just after 48 hours of transplanting in 3–5 cm of standing water. Harvesting and threshing: The right time to harvest the crop is when panicles turn golden yellow in colour and grains have moisture content of 20%. Around 10–12 days prior to the anticipated crop harvesting date, field water should be completely drained. Using Techniques for raising Boro rice production Superior varieties development Agroecosystem characterization Crop management practices Water management techniques Rice-fish culture Farmers’ participatory research Table 2. Improved nursery management technique for Boro rice Attribute Remark Time of sowing November to mid-December. Seed rate Varieties and hybrids, 40 kg and 20 kg/ha respectively. Nursery area 1000 m2 area for 01 ha Seed treatment Dip seed in 2.5% solution of common salt (NaCl) and floating seeds should be discarded and then washed in clean water to remove common salt. To protect seedling from diseases, Carbendazim 50 WP @1.0 g/kg seed or Emisan-6 @2g/kg seed is used. Manures and fertilizers FYM/compost @2000 kg/1000 m2 is applied during first ploughing of nursery bed. N-P2O5-K2O @10-5-5 kg/1000 m2 is applied in split mode. The schedule of fertilization is 5-5-5 kg: N-P2O5-K2O as basal, 2.5 kg N at 20 DAS and 2.5 kg N seven days before uprooting of seedlings. Preparation of seed bed Land should be thoroughly puddled and perfectly levelled before transplanting it in main field.
