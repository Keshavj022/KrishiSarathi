 (1)) contributes to uncertainty with varying degrees and must be accounted for. For example, residue production (Rp) is calculated using the production-to-residue ratio (Fresd) and dry matter fraction (Fdm), which depend on multiple factors that vary regionally, including climate, water availability, soil type and cultivation practices, and are not accounted for completely in our methodology. The uncertainties for Fresd and Fdm were estimated by calculating the difference between the minimum and maximum range and mean values (IPCC, 2006; Jain et al., 2014; Sahai et al., 2011). In addition, the GoI provides agricultural production and area data (Pcrop and Acult) (see Section 4.3); however, these datasets may have uncertainties related to data collection methods and reporting tendencies. Furthermore, the Fcult used for calculating crop-specific burned area from the whole ABA is derived using the same activity data, which may propagate uncertainty. When reporting total un­ certainties, it is important to understand how individual uncertainties contribute, especially in calculations involving independent and corre­ lated variables. Obviously, the correlated terms produce a larger un­ certainty estimate compared to independent terms. For independent variables with given uncertainty, the total percent uncertainty can be estimated by the root sum of squares of their individual percent un­ certainties (Taylor, 1997, Joint Committee For Guides In Metrology (JCGM), 2008). On the other hand, when correlated variables are involved, the resulting total percent uncertainty maximizes into the sum of the individual percent uncertainties (Taylor, 1997, Joint Committee Table 1 List of conversion factors used in the present study.
