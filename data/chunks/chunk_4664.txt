5% EC @ 1 ml/l of water with quizalofop ethyl 5% EC @ 1 ml/l of water at 25 days after transplanting followed by one hand weeding at 45 DAT can also give good results. Harvesting In kharif season, since tops do not fall, bulbs are harvested soon after the colour of leaves changes to slightly yellow and tops start drying and red pigmentation on bulbs develops. Developed true shape bulbs to be harvested and kept for drying the tops. The leaves are cut leaving about 2-2.5 cm tops above the bulb after complete drying. In kharif season, late harvesting results in doubled bulbs and bolting. The average yield of 10-15 t/ha can be obtained in kharif onion crop.

Corresponding author e-mail: sable.pating@gmail.com Onion harvesting and cutting soil, well decomposed organic manure @ 25-30 t/ha to be incorporated into the soil 15 days before transplanting. Application of 250 kg neem cake per hectare can be applied as basal. Biofertilizers viz. PSB, Azotobacter @ 5 kg/ha each and Trichoderma 1.25 kg/ha can be applied through well decomposed organic manure or biofertilizers in liquid form can be preferred for easy application through drip irrigation. Bio-agents should not be used with chemical fertilizers or any agrochemicals. As per normal soil nutrient availability status, NPK @ 100:50:50 kg/ha is to be applied. First dose of NPK @ 50:50:50 kg/ha is to be given at the time of transplanting whereas remaining N @ 50 kg/ha to be given in 2 or 3 equal splits at 30 and 45 or 30, 40 and 50 days after transplanting, respectively. Sixty days after transplanting, no nitrogen containing fertilizers should be applied. Apart from major nutrients application through soil application, water soluble fertilizers and micronutrients can be given to enhance growth and yield in onion crop. About 30 and 45 days after transplanting (DAT), 0.5-1% spray of 19:19:19 (NPK) and one spray of 0.5-1% 13:00:45 or 00:00:50 during 60 DAT can give good results. If soils are deficient in micronutrients and plant show deficiency symptoms of particular micronutrients then particular micronutrients to be given as correction measure. Foliar application of micronutrients mixture (Zn 3%, Fe 2.5%, Mn 1%, Cu 1% and B 0.5%) to be done at 30 and 45 days after transplanting based on soil test reports or when plant show deficiency symptoms.

Thus they require different growing conditions as compared to other normal flower plants. As a result of this, domesticating them as a potted plant is quite difficult. They require special management practices and special care.
