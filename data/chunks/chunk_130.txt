 Natural farming Natural farming is an ecological farming approach established by Masanobu Fukuoka (1913 to 2008), a Japanese farmer and philosopher. Natural methods of farming respect life, maintain natural laws, and apply natural products. Natural farming includes earthworms, microorganisms, and small creatures and it intends to have a positive impact on the environment. Natural Indian Farming farming restores soil damage caused by chemicals and equipment. Natural farming products offer a pleasant taste, superior quality, and higher yields and have high nutritional content. The very essence of the term suggests that nature takes care of the farming process. This method requires minimal external inputs, with just one indigenous cow being sufficient for nearly 30 acres of land. Renowned natural farming advocate Padmashree Mr. Subhash Palekar emphasized that hybrid seeds are more responsive to chemical fertilizers and pesticides, but their responsiveness diminishes over time with increased use. In contrast, indigenous seeds exhibit high responsiveness to natural farming practices, resulting in more productive, nutrient-rich, and healthier crops compared to hybrid seeds. Mr. Palekar asserts that Basmati Rice production using chemical fertilizers reaches only 12 quintals per acre, while natural farming can elevate it to 18 quintals per acre. Similar benefits are expected for Bansi wheat in the Madhya Pradesh region. Table 1.

The total number of farmers practicing natural farming within these states is estimated to be 20.08 lakhs. The highest area under natural farming has been reported from Andhra Pradesh (2.9 lakh hectares) followed by Gujarat (1.86 lakh hectares) and Madhya March 2024 Pradesh (1.11 lakh hectares). Indian Farming 50 March 2024 Components of natural farming Natural farming is based on four key pillars described below: Jivamrita: Jivamrita is a fermented mixture of cow dung, urine, jaggery, pulse flour, water, and farm bund soil, used to improve soil fertility. It is not a fertilizer but a source of 500 million microorganisms that convert nutrients from their 'non-available' state into their 'available' one.
