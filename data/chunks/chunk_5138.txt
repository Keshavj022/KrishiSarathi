 The allopathic treatment was, however, more effective (90%) in bringing faster recovery. In terms of cost effectiveness, availability and safety, bael has superiority over allopathic treatment. Experiment Data of the trial in respect of validation study of ITK in diarrhoeic calves are shown in Tables 2–6 and Figs 6 and 7. It was observed that clinical recovery based on faecal consistency, depression and dehydration score was more prominent in calves of group II, which showed (near normal health) by day 3 of treatment. Similar recovery rate was noticed in this group in respect to parameters like PCV, blood glucose, total protein, A/G ratio, sodium, potassium and chloride.

CONCLUSION Juice of bael fruit is highly effective (80%) in treatment of diarrhoea as judged by PRA tools. It is less effective as compared to allopathic treatment but it is easily available locally, less costly and does not have any adverse effect. No knowledge is available for its use, if given along with allopathic treatment as supportive therapy. Results of the experiment on ITK in diarrhoeic calf undertaken so far indicate that bael powder used along with allopathic treatment was efficacious. Validation of the ITK, undertaken so far relates to bacterial diarrhoea only. REFERENCES Kindersley (1996). The Encyclopedia of Medicinal Plant. Pp. 159 and 307. Nadkarni, K.M. (2000). Indian Medica.

VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Code : 1596 Title of the ITK : Root of daydhapara as an anthelmintic agent Description of the ITK : Roots of daydhapara is used as an anthelmintic agent in animals. In this practice, the roots of daydhapara are dug out from earth and washed. It is then pressed and minced and given to the animals after mixing with salt and water orally for 2–3 days. This is century old practice which is having 70% success rate, and is adopted by some farmers in the Banpur village of Lohardaga district in Jharkhand. About 50% animals are affected with gastro-intestinal worms in this village. Name and address of the discloser : Shri R.K.
