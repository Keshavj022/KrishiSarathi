77%, with the lowest irrigation intensity in Kodagu District and the highest in Dakshin Kannad District. Moreover, the research scrutinized the complex relationship between agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity, with the correlation coefficient increased from 0.162 during 2004–2005 to 0.255 during 2018–2019. It implies that in both periods, a low positive correlation existed between these two variables. Over time, several factors (high-yield seeds and chemical fertilizers) other than irrigation intensity gradually became essential for agricultural efficiency. This research offers a wealth of valuable insights for regional planners and policy-makers contending with comparable challenges in various regions of India and other developing countries. S.

Introduction Food is an essential requirement for human, occupying a central role in discussion related to human development and rights (Misselhorn et al., 2012; Jenkins and Scanlan, 2016). In recent years, the issue of agricultural land scarcity has gained significant concern in developing countries as a result of the rapid conversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural purposes (Tang et al., 2005; Bren D’Amour et al., 2017; Halder, 2019; Kannan et al., 2021). This shift has particularly remarkable implications in developing countries such as India, where the imperative to ensure food security is amplified by the mounting pressure of a growing population on limited land resources (Pimentel et al., 1997; Brahmanand et al., 2013; Majumdar et al., 2017; Kannan et al., 2021). In India, a staggering 85.00% of the agricultural community is composed of small and marginal farmers (Government of India Ministry of Agriculture Department of Agriculture & Cooperation Directorate of Economics & Statistics, 2017). However, this sector grapples with persistent challenges, resulting in a decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). These challenges include escalating labor costs, inadequate market aggregation, insufficient income, farmer indebtedness, and suboptimal implementation of government policies at the grassroots level, further exacerbating the pressure on the agricultural community. Between 2004–2005 and 2018–2019, India witnessed a substantial loss of 291.35 hm2 (20.72%) of net crop area, while the population surged by 1.57×108 persons (17.40%) in the last decade (India Ministry of Home Affairs, 2011; Government of India Ministry of Agriculture Department of Agriculture & Cooperation Directorate of Economics & Statistics, 2019). In spite of the evident scarcity of agricultural land and the escalating pressure from a burgeoning population, 48.67% of India’s land continues to rely on rainfed cultivation (Government of India Ministry of Agriculture Department of Agriculture & Cooperation Directorate of Economics & Statistics, 2019).
