 A majority of the portion of the scab in group C was shed at this stage, revealing filling of underlying wound gap by newly formed replacement of proper tissue. The healing changes were relatively comparable in group A, whereas the margins of group B wounds still did not reveal shedding tendency of scab and therefore exact evaluation of underlying tissue healing was not possible. In general the wound contraction was again greatest in group C and least in group B (Table 4). On day 28 after operation, the gross appearance of wounds in groups A and B was almost comparable to the gross appearance of group C wounds on day 21. Their marginal wound scabs were shed, underlying tissue healing was visible and the wound margins were showing moderate contraction (Fig. 2 A5 and B5). The wounds in group C were exhibiting far more advanced healing changes with even more extensive wound contraction and only very little amount of residual dry scab in the wound centres (Fig. 2 C5, Table 4). The rectal temperature, respiration rate and heart rate in the animals of both the groups remained within the normal physiological range and did not show any significant change during the entire course of study (Table 4). Feed intake was also normal in all the animals of both groups throughout the period of study. Histo-morpholigical observations: On day 7, the section of wound treated with juice of ridge gourd (Fig. 3A), ekdandi (Fig. 3B) and Neosporin ointment (Fig. 3C) on day 7 showed oedema, haemorrhage and leucocytic infiltration, indicating active inflammatory process. The section of wound on day 14 revealed haemorrhage, neutrophilic infiltration and proliferation of fibroblast with budding capillaries in the wound treated with Juice of ridge gourd Table 4.
