   Heat for 5-10 minutes at low flame and add vinegar (optional).   Store in airtight/ glass/container. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 111 Nagaland Rice   For lowland rice apply 220g urea and 312g single super phosphate per plot (10m2) in nursery.   Seed treatment with biocontrol agents like pseudomonas flourescens (10-15g kg- seed) or seedling root dip @ 2.5 kg ha- dissolved in 100 litre of water for 30 minutes or Tricyclazole @ 2g kg- seed or Agrosan/Ceresan @ 2.5 g kg- seed.   Complete transplantation of lowland rice by mid June. For weed management in lowland rice, perform 2 manual weeding.   In absence of adequate labour pre-emergence herbicide viz., Pretilachlor + safener 0.3 kg ha- , on 3rd or 4th day after sowing to control weeds in the lowland rice or pre-emergence application of Butachlor or pendimethilin @3l ha- must be given 1-2 days after sowing or 1-2 days after transplanting.   Release of bio-control agent Trichogramma sp. @ 50,000/ha which should be done in 6 releases at weekly interval.   Placed/ install traps such as yellow sticky traps, light traps and pheromone traps in the field.   For upland jhum rice, conduct regular manual weeding operation as and when required. Regular scouting for incidence of pest and diseases.   For organic control insect pest, apply need based biopesticides, Trichogramma, yellow sticky traps etc. Biocontrol agents like coccinellids, spiders, damsel flies should be conserved. Maize   For pre-kharif maize crop land preparation can be done by giving at least 2-3 deep ploughing. Followed by sowing of maize @ 20-22 kg ha- and maintain spacing 60cm x 20 cm.   Green manure the field with Daincha, Sunhemp and cowpea   At the time of sowing apply FYM or compost 5t ha-1 and N: P2O5: K2O @ 120:60:40 kg ha- . Urea should be applied in 3 splits, mainly at sowing, knee-high and tasselling stages. Entire dose of P& K2O with 1/3rd of urea should be applied at the time of sowing. Application of 25 kg of ZnSO4 at sowing is also recommended since maize is susceptible to Zn deficiency.   Sow the seeds by maintaining a space of 60 x 20 cm ensuring a plant population of 60-65 thousand/h of land.   Earthing up should be done twice, 1st at 35-40 DAS and 2nd at 60-65 DAS.   Apply pre-emergence herbicide Atrazin 1.5-2.0 kg ha- at 2-3 days after sowing to check weed growth up to 30 days. Conduct earthing up operation in standing crops to protect them from lodging. In standing maize crop, apply nitrogen (40 kg ha-) in split dose at knee height stage.   Crop should be kept weed free for 30-45 DAS.   In areas where crop is damaged by hails, resort to re-sowing with medium duration maize varieties such as RCM75 and RCM76 etc.   In drought like situation, crop should be irrigated at knee high stage, flowering stage and grain filling stage.   Regular scouting of incidence of pest and diseases particularly fall armyworm in maize.
