 Whereas, it recorded an average yield of 717.5 q per ha in traditional practice with an average grass and net income of %73,000 and 58,500 per ha respectively and the cost of cost of cultivation in farmers field was $15,000 per ha. ICAR-KVK continued conducting further FLDs on redgram transplanting during 2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15. All these years, average yield obtained was 27.60 q/ha, gross income of %1,13,676/ha and net income of %93,176 with transplanted technology whereas it was 15.20 q/ha, %62,040/ha and 245,540 with farmers practice. Thus, analysis of FLD’s data revealed a remarkable 69.71% to 138% increase in yield PS BSS Pod filling stage Grand growth stage Farmer with blooming crop through the implementation of transplanting technology compared to traditional farming practices followed by farmers. Having achieved the significant yield, redgram transplanting technology was standardized by ICAR- KVK, Bidar which includes preparation of seedlings and transplanting of seedlings in main field. Preparation of redgram seedlings In the first fortnight of May, the process of preparing seedlings begins with the utilization of 4 x 6 inch polythene bags (150 gauge), requiring approximately 6,050 seedlings per ha. These bags are carefully filled with a pot mixture, creating a conducive environment for germination. The filled bags are then arranged and Indian Farming 82 March 2024 Indian Farming 83 March 2024 Steps involved in redgram transplanting placed in partial shade, ensuring optimal conditions for the seeds to sprout. Treated seeds are diligently dibbled into the soil, followed by a daily watering routine to nurture the growing seedlings. The process includes regular weeding and aftercare to foster healthy growth. After 30 days, the well-nurtured seedlings are ready for transplantation, marking a critical step in the journey from preparation to the cultivation of robust plants. Transplanting of redgram seedlings in the field To cultivate a successful crop, the first step involves land preparation, achieved through a series of essential practices such as ploughing, harrowing, and refining the soil to a fine tilth. Following the onset of the monsoon, furrows are opened at a precise distance of 6 feet apart, creating an optimal environment for the upcoming seedling transplant. Seedlings are then transplanted at a distance of 3 feet, utilizing spot application of FYM (Farmyard manure) or vermicompost. The cultivation process continues with timely weeding and nipping at 30 days after transplanting (DAT). To enhance the crop’s nutritional intake, chemical fertilizer is applied using the ring method at a rate of 2.5 bags of DAP (diammonium phosphate) per ha, accompanied by 20 kg of ZnSO4 per ha. Concurrently, proactive plant protection measures are implemented, ensuring the health and vigour of the crop.
