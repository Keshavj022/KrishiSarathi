 This is a passive form of hydroponics, meaning the system works without the need for any motors, pumps, or moving parts. Water culture: Deep Water Culture is one of the most simple and efficient hydroponics technique, where the plant grows in a net pot filled in a small quantity of clay pebbles; the roots develop immersed in a water based mineral solution are constantly oxygenated by an air pump. Ebb and Flow: Ebb and Flow, or Flood and Drain is a system that involves the periodic flooding and draining of the nutrient solutions. Basically, there are two phases of its operation. Flood is when the water and nutrients flow through the growing areas, flowing over the plants’ roots. The drain is when the water drains back to the reservoir. These two actions take turn continuously and hence their name. Drip system: In drip system hydroponics, the water- based nutrient solution is delivered to the root system of plants using drip irrigation. This type of low-flow irrigation is very water-efficient, avoiding waste due to evaporation by providing moisture via slow drip at the base of the plants rather than mimicking rainfall from above.
