 Conclusions The intensity of CSAT use as a behavioural decision in rural house- holds can and will alter adopters' subjective well-being. The ﬁndings show that using CSAT increases farmers’ happiness (HI). Farmers with moderate use of CSAT are the happiest, according to the results. This may be because farmers may not gain the beneﬁts of technology at lower levels, and the costs might be too high at higher levels of CSAT use. Households with lower social capital have lower farmer satisfaction. One noteworthy ﬁnding is that farmers with higher LSCs are happier (although the coefﬁcients are not signiﬁcant). This shows how social capital helps farmers increase their happiness. Farmers who spend moderately on agriculture report higher-than-average satisfaction. Since they live near nature, secluded indigenous tribes are content with their little things, which make them happy. The result also showed that agri- cultural households are more likely to apply CSAT as people get older and more experienced, which boosts happiness. Farmers with a higher HDI are satisﬁed and want better health care and education for their families. However, CSAT is less accessible to households with less land or frag- mented land, preventing them from improving their quality of life. Further, few landowners have kept their property undeveloped and do not employ CSAT. This requires revisiting government land and tenancy policies. The full worth of these CSATs can be determined by analyzing crop productivity, socioeconomic, and soil health data over time. Nevertheless, the study holds signiﬁcant inferences for similar regions globally, particularly in promoting the adoption of CSAT and enhancing the subjective well-being of rural households. First, it underscores the necessity for policymakers to review and potentially revise existing Table 4 Estimation results of the Beta regression.
