However, the households at the bottom of land distribution benefitted relatively more. The income of the landless families increased four times. The medium farm households could realize 3.6 times increase in income followed by marginal farmers (3 times). Increase in income of large and small farm households was by 2.8 times each (Table 46).

Sector-specific Interventions 1.1 Field crops y y Introduction of high yielding and improved varieties of paddy (Jaya, GAR 13, GNR 6, GNR 3, Kamod, Mahisagar, Gurjari), pearl millet (86M52), wheat (GW 451, GW 496), pigeonpea (Vaishali, AGT 2, GP 1, GT 104, BDN 2), chickpea (GJG 3, GG 5), greengram (GAM 5), cowpea (Pusa Phalguni), black gram (GU 1), mustard (NRCHB 101, GDM-4), groundnut (GG 34, GG 20, GJG-22), soybean (NRC 37), sesame (GT 2) and castor (GCH 7). y y Commercial crops like sugarcane (12073, 265, 13073), cotton, tobacco, jute, amaranthus and guar for seeds. y y Introduction of new varieties of fodder (COFS 29, guinea grass, hybrid napier). y y Intercropping in sugarcane, cotton, soybean, maize, pigeonpea and groundnut. y y Spray of 2% potassium nitrate at flowering and pod development stage in chickpea and ferrous sulphate (spray) in groundnut. y y KNO3 and Novel OLN spar on cotton and use of thiourea 500 ppm on wheat. y y Seed treatment with Azatobacter (150 g), PSB (150 g), Rhizobium (25 g/kg), PSB (25 g/kg), and KMB (25 g/kg). y y Soil application of Trichoderma viride and Mycorrhiza. y y Pheromone traps for chickpea pod borer. y y Foliar application of micro nutrient mixtures like pulse wonder, use of pheromone traps, yellow stick traps, line sowing, utilization of residual moisture and mechanical harvesting. y y Stalk puller for uprooting crop stalks of pigeonpea, cotton and castor. y y Bio intensive management of cotton mealy bug through installation of bird perches @ 30-40/ ha, hand collection of egg mass, larvae, neem-based pesticides, HNPV @ 250 LE/ha. y y Use of ICT tools for market, adoption of organic farming, crop rotation, optimum plant population, low-cost production technology, crop diversification, change in the cropping pattern and water management in summer instead of leaving fallow.
