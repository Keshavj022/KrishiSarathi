 Tackling them with new Indian Horticulture 106 strategies and techniques with minimal adverse effects on human health, non-target organisms, and the environment is a challenge that plant protection experts face together with agrochemists. Recently, some arthropod pests are commonly found causing economic damage to several horticultural crops, fruits and vegetables. Most of them are polyphagous and feed on several hosts. In NE India, the organic hub of the country, the use of chemical pesticides is usually discouraged, and farmers are encouraged to adopt a multi-pronged strategy that integrates different pest management techniques to manage the pest. MANAGEMENT OF PEST IN NORTHEAST INDIA Spiralling whitefly The spiralling whitefly, Aleurodicus dispersus Russell, is indigenous to Central America, the Caribbean, and the Pacific islands. It was so named because it lays eggs in a spiralling pattern. The whitefly has successfully spread across Africa, Asia, and Australia, colonising nearly all tropical regions globally. Their hosts encompass a wide range of vegetation, including vegetables, fruits, decorative plants, and avenue trees. Within a few years, this pest has established itself and now spread to other crops such as guava, banana, brinjal and ornamentals and has become a severe pest in NE India since the past decade. It has been reported on endemic crops like king chilli, too. After sucking sap from leaves, nymphs and adults release honeydew and a white waxy flocculent. The insect’s white flocculent wax gave the plant a cotton-like appearance from afar. This white waxy material prevents insecticidal sprays from contacting the insect body, making them less effective. Some plant-sucking insects emit honeydew, which causes sooty mould. This mould can worsen plant damage. The best pest management method is monitoring and scouting to prevent pests from appearing in a field or garden. Under favourable weather conditions, a few surviving nymphs or adults can rapidly colonise the population, making population management difficult. Horticultural mineral oils are the most effective and safe pest control approach in many situations. Mineral oils can block the insect’s spiracles and dissolve the pest defence formed by the waxy flocculent substance, exposing it to abiotic stress. However, they should not be used under high temperatures reaching 30oC. Two efficient whitefly treatments are Hortimin and Lastraw horticultural oils. Whitefly populations can be controlled with 5 ml of oil per litre of water. Horticultural oils can manage pests, protect non-target organisms, and decompose quickly, making them potential pesticide alternatives. Spraying of neem oil (2%), neem seed kernel extract (3%), fish oil resin soap (4%) and detergent soap solution (5%), Pongamia products, viz., oil and soap were also found to be effective in suppressing the nymphal and adult whitefly population under low population level.
