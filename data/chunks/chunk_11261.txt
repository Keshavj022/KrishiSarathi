 yy For those areas, where transplanting in time is not possible with 30 -35 days old seedling due to drought like situations or due to flood and seedlings get older, farmers may select some staggered planting rice varieties (having flexibility in seedling age) like Gitesh (150-160 days) and Prafulla (150-160 days) which can be transplanted with 30 days old seedling up to 60 days old seedlings. yy For chronically flood affected areas or occasional flood affected areas, kharif rice varieties having 145 -150 days crop duration like Ranjit Sub 1, Bahadur Sub 1, Swarna Sub 1 which can withstand10 -12 days water submergence after crop establishment may be selected. yy For multiple cropping situations where kharif rice is followed by rapeseed and mustard, lentil, linseed, rabi vegetables, potato, 116 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS maize etc, recommended medium duration (135 days) varieties like Shraboni, Mulagabharu, Satya, Basundhara or other suitable varieties may be selected. Seed selection and nursery management in kharif rice yy For sowing in the nursery bed, rice seed should be put in plain water and floated seeds should be rejected. After selection, seeds should be soaked for 24 hours in fungicidal solutions prepared with Chlorothalonil @ 2.5 g per litre of water or Bavistin @ 2.5 g per litre of water. After that, treated seed should be incubated for 48 hours. yy Nursery bed should be of 10 m length and 1.25 m breadth with a 30 cm gap in between two beds. The length of the bed may vary according to convenience and the 30 cm gap may be utilized for draining out excess water during the period of heavy rain or for apply irrigation water during dry spell. yy In each bed of above size (10 m x 1.25 m), 20-30 kg FYM or compost 80 g urea, 80 g SSP and 40 g MOP are to be applied and mixed well with the soil. Well germinated seeds are to be sown in the nursery bed @ 650 g to 1000 g per bed depending on the size of the seed. yy For transplanting 1 hectare area of main field, seed requirement is 40 â€“ 45 kg. In the nursery bed, saturated condition may be maintained through rain water or irrigation water; however, 2-3 cm depth of water to be maintained at least for 2-3 days before uprooting of seedlings. yy For plant protection in the nursery bed, as soon as one or two blast spots are seen, Azoxystrobin @ 1g / l of water or Trifloxystrobin @ 1g per litre of water is to be sprayed. Transplantation in main field of kharif rice yy After uprooting of seedling and before transplanting in the mainfield, root dip treatment of seedlings with Thiamethoxam 25 WG (1 ml/l of water) along with 1% urea (10 g/l of water) for 3 hours 117 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS may be done to protect the crop initially from stem borer, gall midge and hopper in the main field. Alternatively, carbofuran @ 3 g/sqm can also be applied in the bed 5 -7 days before uprooting.
