 Influence of tillage practices on powdery mildew incidence in wheat Influence of tillage practices on termite damage in wheat TILLAGE OPERATIONS AND TERMITE AND POWDERY MILDEW DAMAGES ON WHEAT and the maximum was under the conventional tillage system. Zero tillage seems to be a cost-effective and sustainable weed-management system. Delayed N application, 1/3rd or 1/4th at flag leaf or at flowering stage along with the addition of sulphur at 25 kg/ha has been found to enhance grain yield and increase protein content of wheat by 7–10%. Cotton LH 900, followed by wheat PBW 343/PBW 373 was the best option for avoiding delay in wheat-sowing in cotton-wheat system, and it produced highest wheat equivalent yield among the 4 cotton varieties tested. Use of defoliant in the 1st week of November helped in uniform opening and picking of bolls, and leaf- litter fallen had added to organic carbon (1.9–3.3 tonnes/ha) and nutrients into the soil. Intercropping of legumes for green manure in cotton-crop could add 46–52 kg nitrogen/ha. Crop Protection Around 17,500 samples were analyzed for Karnal bunt (KB) and over 5,000 for black point, and over 2,200 for grain discolouration were collected from all-over the country. From Gujarat, Karnal Bunt has not been detected since the last one decade. In Haryana, the south-west region had very low incidence, with Fatehabad district yielding no infected samples, and samples from Sirsa, Hisar and Bhiwani showed very low incidence. SOFTWARES FOR KARNAL BUNT DETECTION DEVELOPED GEOKB and KBRISK softwares have been developed which can indicate whether the wheat areas lie in the high, low or no risk zones for KB. This is the first PRA on KB in the country. PATHOTYPES OF RUSTS IDENTIFIED ON WHEAT A new pathotype of Puccinia striiformis has been identified from PBW 343 leaves infected with yellow rust. This pathotype has been named as 78S84. This is the second pathotype of yellow rust, which is virulent on Yr 9. Though the new pathotype has rendered PBW 343 susceptible, but it is less virulent than pathotype 46S119, to which PBW 343 and PBW 373 are resistant. Apart from the new pathotype (78S84), 10 pathotypes of yellow rust have been observed. The pathotype 46S119 (virulent on Yr 9) has showed an increase in its proportion. Twenty pathotypes of brown rust from India and 5 from Nepal have been identified. Pathotype flora of the Himachal Pradesh was the most diverse one and yielded 15 pathotypes. In Central and Peninsular zones, stem rust spectrum showed occurrence of 4 pathotypes during the crop season and 5 during off-season at Wellington.
