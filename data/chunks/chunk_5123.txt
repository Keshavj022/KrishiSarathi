Therefore they have a higher ranking for ITK as compared to allopathic drugs. They consider that after allopathic treatment milk yield of goat is decreased.If the treatment is done with pojo bark the goats regain milking earlier than by the use of allopathic drugs. Experiment After faecal examination it was found that the majority of diarrhoea cases in goats were due to nematode (Haemonchus contortus), trematode (Amphistomes), cestode (Moniezia) and protozoa (Coccidia). It is observed from the data presented in Table 2 that pojo paste is effective for control of diarrhoea in worm negative cases only. Fifty in Table 1. Farmers were of the opinion that pojo is as efficient as an allopathic drug for the treatment of diarrhoea. They expressed that the Fig. 1.

In contrast, 100 % diarrhoea could be cured by using allopathic medicine in worm negative cases within 3 days. If the therapy was prolonged for 6 days , 60 % of the problem was cured. The percentage of cure in 4 to 6 days was stagnant up to 60 % with pojo paste. On the contrary, the recommended practice could cure 80% of cases within 3 days. The paste of pojo could not cure diarrhoea where the causative agents were gastrointestinal parasites. The administration of anthelmintic ( panacur ) was very effective in the cure of diarrhoea associatedwith helminthes.The ranking of other criteria is given in Table 3. Pojo bark treatment is safer as compared to allopathic medicine. Phytochemical evaluation (i) The bark was crushed into fine powder and dried to remove any moisture. (ii) Sohxlet apparatus was used for successive extraction. The extraction was done with the help of solvents in increasing polarity viz. (a) petroleum ether (60°–80°C) (b) Chloroform (c)Ethyl acetate (d)Methanol (iii) TLC patterns of the individual extract was taken.
