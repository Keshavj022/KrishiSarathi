  Three months after stocking, females undergo final oocyte maturation with vitellogenic oocytes measuring more than 500-µm in size and males are found in milt oozing stage.  Both the females and males are injected with human chorionic gonadotrophin @ 350 IU/ kg body weight. Spawning occurs within 36-38 h after injection and the number of eggs spawned ranges 0.6-1.5 lakhs/spawner.  The eggs hatch out after 20-22 hrs at temperature of 28-30ºC and salinity of 30-32%. Newly hatched larvae measure 2.1-2.2 mm in total length.  Larvae are stocked in green water at 10 nos/l and are fed a combination of rotifers and copepod nauplii (2 nos/ml) initially, followed by Artemia nauplii and artificial feed.  The metamorphosis of the larvae starts on the 17th day post-hatch and is completed by 22nd day post-hatch by which time it reaches a size of 1.6-1.7 cm.  The breeding technology is mainly confined to the states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.

Newly hatched larvae measure 1.2-1.6 mm in total length.  Larvae are stocked in green water at 10 nos/l and are fed a combination of rotifers, copepod nauplii and artificial feed. Larvae metamorphose to juveniles at about 33-37 days post hatch, by which time it reaches a size of 1.5-2.0 cm.  The technology is being extended in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.
