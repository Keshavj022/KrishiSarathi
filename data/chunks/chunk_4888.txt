 These studies integrate various factors such as soil characteristics, climatic conditions, topography, and land use into the decision-making process to create suitability maps. By combining spatial data with weighted criteria, the authors developed a model that evaluates potential sites for oil palm production under rainfed conditions. This method provides a systematic and transparent approach to land suitability analysis, considering the ecological and socio- economic factors critical for sustainable cultivation of oil palm under rainfed conditions. Thematic rasters, representing key factors influencing land suitability, were created in a GIS. Utilizing MCDA techniques, a digital suitability map was generated in ArcGIS 10.3, delineating three distinct classes over an extensive area of 10.5 million. Further, with an aim to focus on actual locations that can be readily planted with oil palm, the suitable locations identified were restricted to eight selected land use/land cover (LULC) classes. This strategic limitation aimed to facilitate the expansion of OP cultivation exclusively to areas deemed most suitable based on the identified criteria. The results of the study show that the integration of GIS and MCDA is highly effective in producing accurate suitability maps for oil palm. The maps generated highlight the most favourable regions for oil-palm cultivation based on Validating suitability maps of Kerala and Arunachal Pradesh with real time data Oil-palm suitability maps under rainfed conditions in different Indian states (a) (c) (e) (g) (b) (d) (f) Assam Suitability for Oil Palm (under rainfed conditions) Arunachal Pradesh Suitability for Oil Palm (under rainfed conditions) Manipur Suitability for Oil Palm (under rainfed conditions) Mizoram Suitability for Oil Palm (under rainfed conditions) Nagaland Suitability for Oil Palm (under rainfed conditions) Legend Legend Legend Legend Legend Legend Legend Tripura Suitability for Oil Palm (under rainfed conditions) Meghalaya Suitability for Oil Palm (under rainfed conditions) Novemberâ€“December 2024 53 specific criteria, helping policymakers and land managers make informed decisions about agricultural expansion. The approach not only enhances the precision of land- use planning but also minimizes the environmental and social impacts of oil palm farming by avoiding unsuitable or vulnerable areas. This methodology can be adapted and applied to other crops and regions, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices worldwide. Litchi As climate change and land degradation continue to impact agricultural productivity, identifying suitable regions for growing fruit crops has become crucial. Litchi (Litchi chinensis), along with other fruit crops like mango, citrus, and apple, require specific climatic and soil conditions for optimal growth.
