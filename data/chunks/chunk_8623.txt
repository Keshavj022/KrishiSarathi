 The cost of grazing, fodder, shearing and prophylaxis and treatment for 16 animals in each group for 1 year under continuous, rotational, deferred rotational and grazing plus supplementation system was Rs 10,482, 5,990, 1,000, 238 and 316 respectively. The cost of concentrate feeding in continuous, rotational, deferred rotational and grazing plus supplementation system was Rs 2,809, 2,805, 2,819, and 7,533 respectively. Thus the total expenditure on 16 animals in these group was Rs 20,835, 20,859, 20,834 and 25,548 accounting grazing charges Economics of goat sheep rearing under different grazing system was studied DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 126 l Low cost processed cheese prepared. l Conical process vat for viscous dairy products improved. l Fruit dahi preparation technology developed. l Dahi prepared from camel milk. and cost of fodder consumed by these animals from the pasture under continuous, rotational, deferred rotational and grazing plus supplementation system, respectively. However leaving aside the expenses on account of grazing charge and fodder cost, the total rearing expenditure under the four systems will be Rs 3,363, 3,387, 3,362 and 8,076 respectively. The total receipt in terms of value addition from lambs/kids, wool and manure was Rs 8,309, 7,702, 7,268 and 10,147 under continuous, rotational, deferred rotational and grazing plus supplementation systems respectively. DAIRYING AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS TECHNOLOGY MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS TECHNOLOGY Value Added Products/Processes/Technologies Developed low cost processed cheese (PC) preparations: The PC preparations substituting milk fat completely with vegetable fat were lower in costs and with a quality comparable to that of conventional processed cheese. Process for micro-filtered milk with extended shelf life: The shelf life of the micro-filtered milk and that of the pasteurized micro-filtered milk was more than 1 month while it was 4 days for raw milk and 14 days for the pasteurized milk at 46°C. Improved the conical process vat for viscous dairy products: This unit can be adopted by dairy plants handling viscous milk products. Adoption of continuous paneer making machine: The unit can easily be adopted for other acidic coagulated milk products. Developed technologies for fruit dahi: Fermented milks have been developed with the improved shelf life and acceptability. The plain dahi, had a shelf life of 18 days and the fruit dahi of 26 days at a storage temperature of 6 ± 1°C. Standardized process of camel milk fermentation, viz., dahi: Its sensory evaluation test indicated 85% acceptability. The texture of camel curd (fermented milk) is loose and requires longer incubation period (18–22 hr) as compared to cattle milk curd. Camel milk curd has positive influence on digestive systems. l Synergistic action of anti-microbial components was observed in goat milk.
