 Bran fatty acid esteriﬁed to the cell wall provided most cereal grains’ phenolic acid. Polishing milled rice reduces its nutritional content, reducing phenolic compounds. Heat treatment also destabilizes cell wall structure and binding, making bound phenolics such as p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid more extractable and releasable [73,87,88].

Digestibility Parboiled rice is noted for its superior digestibility properties compared to raw white rice [6,7]. The digestibility features of a starch products are described via their impact on human blood glucose levels after human consumption. Starch’s digestive qualities may have a signiﬁcant impact on human health. Starch is classiﬁed into three types: resistant starch, slowly digested starch, and rapidly digestible starch [89]. Table 5 shows the digestibility of parboiled rice from various studies. The ﬁrst thing to bed measured for digestibility properties was rapidly digestible starch. Rapidly digestible starch (RDS) relates to increased blood glucose and insulin levels. The fastest rate at which glucose is released into the system after consuming a starchy diet is known as RDS. The slowly digestible starch (SDS) is starch digested at a slower rate than RDS. The SDS is the preferred starch digestibility rate because it induces a slower rise in postprandial blood glucose levels and sustained blood glucose levels over time compared to RDS. SDS is linked with a diminished feeling of hunger after eating because of the slower speed of carbohydrate hydrolysis. Regardless of variety, parboiled rice revealed lower RDS and elevated SDS and RS [90]. Table 5.
