Spatial distribution of Irrigation Water Quality Index in the Arjunanadi River basin of south India. M.R. Hari Raj et al. Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 229 (2025) 109932 13 395 km2, 14 groundwater samples (15 %) have high restrictions zone, indicating soils with great permeability and no compacted layers, which can use this water. Regular watering with high frequency is suitable for moderate and high salt tolerant plants to grow. In 19 % (n = 18) of groundwater sample covering an area of 18.5 km2 is found to be severe restriction. This water is not suitable for irrigation. However, only high salt acceptance plants should be used (Table 6) (Fig. 7). Masoud et al., 2022 done a similar study on assessment of groundwater quality for agricultural use under various conditions by utilizing water quality indices, regression with partial least squares models, and GIS method­ ologies in Makkah Al-Mukarramah region of Saudi Arabia. The finding shows that 31 % of the samples in the study area were classified as no restriction, 33 % as low to moderate restriction and 36 % as high to severe restriction. In this study 16 % of samples classified as no re­ striction class followed by 23 % as low restriction, 27 % as moderate restrictions, 15 % as high restrictions and 19 % as severe restriction. 3.4.
