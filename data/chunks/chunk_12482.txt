 Thus, expected income/family/year from the sale of pashmina and extra animal after 5 years will be Rs 45,000, and thus expected unit value after 5 years will be Rs 2,50,000 for 50 animals. Thus, rearing of pashmina sheep will enhance the economy of the farmersâ€™ manifolds. 235 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 12 Jharkhand The State of Jharkhand formerly a part of Bihar was formed on November 15th, 2000 with Ranchi as its capital.
