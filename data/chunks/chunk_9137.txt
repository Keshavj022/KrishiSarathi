 Although increase in production during the fifties has been largely due to area expansion, the uptrend in production in the past two decades has been due to increase in productivity alone — from 100 kg lint/ha in 1954-55 to 261 kg lint/ ha in 1992-93. In fact the area covered by the crop has stabilized at 7.5 million hectares during this period. Total production in the country has risen from 2.75 million bales to 11.58 million bales of cotton of all staple lengths. Cotton SUVIN in flowering.

More than 100 varieties and 20 hybrids belonging to four staple lengths have been developed by the ICAR. Of them LAXMI, SUVIN, BIKANER] NERMA, H 777, F414, MCU5, LRA5166, SRT 1, GCOT 11, V 797, JAYDHAR and hybrids HYBRID 4, VARALAXMI, H 6, DCH 32, G COT HYBRID 7 have added to the total yield significantly. India is the only country to have developed and grown hybrid cotton comm- ercially—both, the long-staple premier hybrid cotton H 4 and the extraiong staple interspecific VARALAXMI and DCH 32. SUVIN gives the finest-quality cotton with spinning performance of 120s counts. It is comparable with GIZA 45, the best Egyptian cotton. The latest additions are early-maturing hybrids FATEH, DHANLAXMI and RAJHANS for Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, the north-west region. Production- and plant- protection technologies for the crop are near perfect. ... HYBRIDS IN COTTON India is the only country in the world to have produced and commercialized hybrids in cotton, H 4 and VARALAXM| are the earliest hybrids developed in 1970 and 1972. To follow are: FATEH, DHANLAXMI and RAJHANS for north-west India. They are early-maturing, intra-hirsutum hybrids. LDH 11, an intraspecific hybrid (bengalense x cernuum), is an arboreum cotton. in pipeline are: CHH 107, LHH 121, LHH 144, CSHA 29, CSH 33, PUNJAB HB 354 and PUSA HB 322. IN FUTURE... To produce 18 million bales by the turn of the century and to remain competitive in the international market, our research strategies are: @ development of more heterotic hybrids of medium-and-ong staple length and sowing more cotton area with them @ development of high-yielding varieties and hybrids for rainfed and critical environment @ stabilization of yield through development and adoption of integrated management approach against pests and diseases. JUTE & ALLIED FIBRES Jute is predominantly a crop of eastern India. Jute production had been 1.6 million bales and productivity 1.
