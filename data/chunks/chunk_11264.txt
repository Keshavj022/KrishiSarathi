 yy Adult cow/buffalo/goat should be de-wromed preferably with Fenbendazole @ 7 mg/ kg body weight. yy Pigs are de-wormed with Albendazole @ 5mg/ kg body weight and Piperzine specifically against round worm @ 110-200 mg/ kg body weight yy Poultry are de-wormed with Piperzine @ 32mg/ kg in two consecutive feed or water against round worm and Albendazole against other worms @ 10 mg/ kg body weight with or without Praziquantel @ 5mg/ kg body weight and depending on age of the bird. 121 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS SIKKIM Advisory for kharif field crop yy Rice transplanting for mid and high altitude should be completed by month of June and in low altitude it should be completed by fifteen July. Delay in transplanting will affect reproductive phase and yield will be reduced significantly. yy 1000 m2 nursery area is sufficient for transplanting of one hectare land. During nursery seed bed preparation, well decomposed FYM should be applied 2-3 days before sowing @ 10 q/ 1000 sq.m or vermicompost can be used @ 500kg/1000 sq m. yy Use high yielding and quality seed @ 30 -40 kg/ha depending on seed size. yy In addition Azospirillum may be applied @ 2kg /1000 sq. m. area. yy Besides the nursery preparation farmers are also suggested to start main field preparation for paddy transplantation through repairing old bunds by maintaining 20-30 cm height in lowland situation. yy Sow green manure crop viz. dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) in the month of May. After 40 days (knee height) crop should be incorporated into the soil through ploughing (Trampling) 10-15 days prior to transplanting. yy Before transplanting, application of FYM 8-10 t/ha or vermicompost @ 3-6 t/ha either alone or in combination should be applied 15 days before transplanting. yy Neem based formulation @ 0.5% or 5ml/l water can be used for pest management. yy Apply neem-based formulation (1500 ppm) @ 0.5% or 5ml/l at 7-10 days intervals for Fall Army Worm Control. yy Weeding and other intercultural operations of maize should be restricted if tasseling emergence start. 122 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS Advisory for Kharif Horticulture crops yy In high altitude, farmers are advised to use polythene covers/shade above the nursery to protect vegetable seedling from extreme weather condition. yy Provide support of bamboo structure for climbing upward the plants like bottle gourd, bitter gourd, cucumber and bean. yy The ginger/turmeric plot should be well drained to prevent rhizome rot. The field must be inspected regularly for disease appearance and more often when it rains. yy Farmers are advised to spray neem-based formulation (1500 ppm) @ 3-5 ml/litre of water or Bacillus thuringinsis @ 2g/l or Metarhiziumanisopliae @ 5ml/l and Copper oxychloride @ 0.25% to avoid any of pest and diseases in large cardamom.
