On-farm validation trials were laid out using randomized block design with 5 treatments and 3 replications as indicated earlier in Table 1. Regarding pre-treatment incidence of khaira disease; trial plots at village Patti, Manda and Kamua showed incidence of khaira disease 50– 60, 35–40 and 20–25% of crop stand respectively (Table 5). Regarding post-treatment incidence of khaira revealed deficiency of zinc availability in the plots of Patti and Kamua villages. The levels of available zinc were found below the critical limit  PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT Table 6.
