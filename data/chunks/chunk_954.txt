It is recognized as one of the most feasible, cost-effective and rational ways of developing resilience to the changing climate. Adoption of crop diversification can help to increase the income of small landholder farmers, conservation of natural resources, many agronomic benefits in pest management by breaking insect habitats and disease cycles, reducing weeds and soil erosion, and conserving soil moisture. The major challenges observed for the adoption of crop diversification are; maximum cropped area of the country is dependent on rainfall, sub-optimal and over-use of resources like land and water, inadequate supply of seeds and improved plants materials, fragmentation of land holding and inadequate post-harvest infrastructure for perishable produce. Keywords: Crop diversification, Cropping pattern, Economic stability, Natural calamities Indian Farming 73 (02): 12-14; February 2023 C ROP diversification is largely dependent on technology advancements aimed at achieving sustainable intensification and greater productivity while lowering input costs and thus increasing farmer's income. Diversification’s dynamic feature includes accommodating new crops or cropping patterns that are best suited to current eco- regional circumstances while ensuring increased productivity and profitability. Agricultural intensification has already aided us in achieving food security, but there is a need to reorient existing agricultural systems to be more sustainable, which continue to address household food, nutrition and environmental security. Crop diversification aims to provide farmers more options for growing a range of crops in climate- resilient areas and reducing the risk of crop failure due to drought or excess rains.
