Communication Technologies Various types of communication technologies are used in M2M/ IoT domain depending upon the coverage, power, QoS, specific use-case requirement etc. These communication technologies may be categorized to work in Personal/ Neighborhood /Local /Wide Area Network i.e. PAN/ NAN/ LAN / WAN depending upon the coverage distance. Figure 4: Communication Technologies in M2M/ IoT domain Communication technologies for M2M / IoT domain have been studied in TEC, resulting in two technical reports, released in 2017 and 2021. Technical Report on Communication technologies in M2M/ IoT domain2 was released in 2017. This report covers Cellular Technologies (2G, 3G, 4G i.e. up to LTE 3GPP Release 14), Low power wireless communication technologies (NFC, RFID, Bluetooth, ZigBee etc.), Low power wide area network technologies (LPWAN – cellular/ non-cellular), Wi-Fi [IEEE 802.11 a, b, g, n, ac], DSRC (802.11p), wire line (PLC, DSL, FTTH) etc and the related use cases. 2 https://tec.gov.in/pdf/M2M/Communication%20Technologies%20in%20IoT%20domain.pdf Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report 2.
