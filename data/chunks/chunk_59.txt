 This enables to demonstrate the potentiality of the technologies with scale to participating farmers as well as the farmers of adjacent villages and other agencies. The robustness of precision in outcomes of technology dissemination is enhanced due to economy of scale so is the opportunities for performance analysis and the feedback of practitioners. The frontline extension agencies in Rajasthan under ICAR-ATARI, Jodhpur have been implementing CFLDs on mothbean. During 2022, CFLDs on 340 ha involving 840 farmers were conducted in stressed districts of Bikaner, Barmer, Churu, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Nagaur in western Rajasthan. Full packages of practices of mothbean including newly developed varieties, sowing methods, seed treatment, integrated nutrient management (INM), use of micronutrients, bio-fertilizers, integrated pest and diseases management and intercropping, etc. were implemented. The attributes of demonstrated varieties of mothbean are presented in Table 2. district, Rajasthan Indian Farming 22 March 2024 Indian Farming 23 March 2024 Yield and yield gap To demonstrate the potential yields of three leading varieties of mothbean viz. RMO-2251, RMO-435 and RMO-257, demonstrations were organised at farmers' fields. Average yield of 551 kg/ha and net return of `17516/ha was obtained with improved varieties and packages of practices adopted in CFLDs compared to 414 kg/ha yield and `12537/ha net return under farmers’ practices. The yield gap between the yields of CFLDs and that of farmers practice was 34.7% (137 kg/ha) (Table 3 and 4). Table 2.
