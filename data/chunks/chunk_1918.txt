 LoRa technology enables efficient, low-cost, and low-energy communication for devices that need to transmit small amounts of data over considerable distances. LoRa can be used to connect sensors, gateways, machines, devices, etc. wirelessly to the cloud. LoRa Technologies operates in different frequency bands in different regions; in India it operates in the frequency band of 865 to 868 MHz. Its distinctive features include an impressive communication range, covering several kilometers in rural environments and reaching a few hundred meters in urban areas. LoRa devices are characterized by their low power consumption, ensuring extended battery life for connected devices, making it well-suited for applications in remote or challenging locations where frequent battery replacements are impractical.

Non-Cellular LPWAN Technologies LoRaWAN LoRaWAN, which stands for Long Range Wide Area Network, is a communication protocol designed for lowpower wide area networks (LPWANs) that offer long range and secure data transmission for M2M and loT applications. LoRa is based on chirp spread spectrum modulation, which has low power characteristics like FSK modulation but can be used for long range communications.
