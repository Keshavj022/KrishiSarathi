 Indigenous Breeds Project: Under the Indigenous Breeds Project, 26 breeding bulls of Gir, Sahiwal and Kankrej were inducted in the third set for progeny testing. A total of 45,511, 44,521 and 11,890 semen doses were produced from Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal breeds, respectively. And 2,800, 2,003 and 1,163 inseminations were carried out during the year with overall conception rate of 42.65, 52.57 and 45.33% respectively, and 625, 173 and 212 daughters were produced. Field Progeny Testing Project (FPT): Under Field Progeny Testing Programme, 30 bulls were introduced for test mating. Frozen semen doses (60,000) were distributed (500 semen doses/bull/centre) to GADVASU, Ludhiana; KVASU, Thrissur; BAIF, Uruli Kanchan; and GBPUA&T, Pantnagar. The overall conception rate was 43.5%. Buffaloes Field progeny testing of bulls: Under field progeny testing programme (FPT) at CIRB Hisar, 4,119 AIs were performed using 28 test bulls with 50.41% conception rate in 10 adopted villages. Genetic improvement: In a Murrah herd, the overall wet average, herd average, 305 days milk yield and average lactation milk yield were 8.45 kg, 5.67 kg, 2,398 kg and 2,598 kg, respectively, which were highest since inception of the project. The service period was 148 days and calving interval 460 days during the period. In Nili-Ravi buffaloes, the overall wet average, herd average, 305 days milk yield and average lactation milk yield were 8.10 kg, 5.68 kg, 2,473 kg and 2,564 kg, respectively, which were also highest since inception of the project. The service period was 135 days and calving interval 442 days. Germplasm conservation and dissemination: Murrah young bulls (28) were tentatively selected as future breeding bulls and 6 superior males selected for test mating of 15th and 16th sets. A total of 106,729 and 16,890 semen doses of Murrah and Nili-Ravi bulls were frozen. Sheep Introgression of FecB gene: A prolific triple breed cross Avishaan developed at CSWRI, Avikanagar, has 12.5% Garole, 37.5% Malpura and 50% Patanwadi inheritance. Avishaan ewe has 99.2% tupping and 98.5% lambing rate on available basis. Multiple births of 57.1% with litter size of 1.6 indicated successful introgression of FecB gene in this prolific strain. The average live weights at birth, 3, 6 and 12 months of age of the lambs were 3.1, 16.2, 24.2 and 31.8 kg, respectively. Average adult annual greasy fleece yield is 954 g. The survivability during pre- and post-weaning of lambs and adult stage were 93.0, 96.1 and 98.6%, respectively. In the field flocks, average body weights at birth, 3, 6 and 12 months of age of the lambs born were 2.8, 13.2, 23.0 and 28.1kg, respectively. Network Project on Sheep Improvement: The Network Project on Sheep Improvement (NWPSI) aims at genetic evaluation and continuous improvement of indigenous sheep breeds through selection for better growth and wool production.
