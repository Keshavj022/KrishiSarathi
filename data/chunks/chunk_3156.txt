 • The bruchids incidence of stored arid pulses was effectively controlled at least up to 200 days following seed treatment with 8 ml/kg of mustard seasame or groundnut oil. Agronomy • Two years study revealed that grain yield of guar (1184 kg/ha) and cow pea (1217 kg ha‐1) increased by about 23.0 and 9.72%, over control values of 900.0 and 1110.0 kg ha‐1, respectively following spray of ZnSO4 @ 0.5% at 25 and 45 days after sowing. • Guar‐guar cropping system earned maximum net return (Rs 12660/ha) followed by cow pea (Rs 9814/ha) under rainfed conditions. • Grain yield of arid legumes could be increased by about 25% by keeping the crops weed free up to 25‐30 days of sowing at the farmers fields. Specific Development of Neno‐cultivars • In case of cow pea and horse gram maturity has been curtailed from almost 90‐95 days to 60 days with grain yield peaking almost up to 700‐800 and 900‐1000 kg, respectively, without fertility, irrigation and plant protection measures. Diversification of agriculture: • Cow pea genotypes for summer season for Uttranchal, and Punjab have been identified. • Guar has been introduced in Anantpur and Chittoor districts to supplement poor yielding groundnuts, under rainfed conditions. Increased export: • Export of guar gum is increasing and peaking $ 459 m in 2006‐07. • No. of voluntary centers joined this project was 30 (against only 9 regular centers) during Xth Plan period, which itself proves its popularity. www.icar.org.in 18 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science All India Coordinated Research Project on Castor 1.
