 • Best plant population + 200 kg nitrogen in splits in organic form + 100 kg P2O5 + 100 kg K2O + irrigation 100% replenishment of CPE + 4 application of Trichoderma + Sanitation has been found to show better growth, yield attributes and high organic carbon content in soil compared to other treatments. vii) IPM of Root knot nematode • The results revealed that the application of oil cakes + carbofuran + three or four inoculations of P. lilacinus inoculated oil cakes showed best control of root knot nematode and increased leaf yield compared to other treatments. viii) Management of insect pests • Application of NSKE 5% spray 3 times + NSKE 5% drench 3 times or application of Beauveria bassiana 5gms/lit containing 1.8 x 106 spores/gm recorded higher mean plan height, stem girth and lower number of grubs per plant there by effectively checking the incidence of stem weevil of live support of Betelvine (sesbania )

Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years): The All India Coordinated Research Project focus on nutrition security and also carried out the trials on development, sensory and nutritional evaluation of low Glycemic Index (GI) products for acceptability trials. It strives to achieve livelihood security for quality/decent living income from various non farm occupation and enterprises. It has helped farm women to reduce drudgery and alleviate health hazards and enhancing efficiency through Capacity Building. The empowerment of farm women is very important to conserve natural resources to make most efficient use of farm and non‐farm produce. Nutritional Security • Total of 18 low glycemic index products were formulated and fed to 300 female adults (18‐ 30 years). Anthropometrical measurements of subjects were recorded. The mean height and weight of subjects varied from 149‐162 cms and 42‐59 kgs respectively. • Twenty eight products were tested for storage studies. Increased storage period of the product decreased the acceptability. • IEC programmes were done for improving the nutritional status of rural population.
