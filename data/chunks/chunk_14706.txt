 LSM generated in this study provides a high resolution map with 100 m resolution. This map incorporates various sustainability factors, primarily focusing on SDG #2 (Zero Hunger), #6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and #7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). Additionally, we have taken care to minimize potential impact on other ecologically significant areas like forests. This approach ensures a balanced consideration of multiple environmental and sustainability aspects in our study. We used CCA to identify the LULC classes most strongly associated with the SAW nexus and agricultural and hydrological variables, then quantified the strengths of these associations. This information helps to understand the significance of the nexus on a larger scale. Previously CCA proved as an important method to observe the interaction between LULC classes and variable parameters [83]. It gives an idea of the importance of the SAW nexus and its influence on society. Eventually, it can facilitate the establishment of strategies to optimize the use of these resources in accordance with sustainable development and energy security policies. A more detailed study is required to evaluate the interaction within the nexus. 5.1. Policies to promote sustainable resource management in SAW nexus Stringent laws have shown an overall positive effect on carbon emission and sustainability [84]. The policies need careful study and implementation to ensure a sustainable future. The approach should be comprehensive, considering interdependencies and trade-offs between sectors, with a focus on optimizing resource use, minimizing waste, and boosting resilience. The following policies are recommended to promote sustainable resource management. I. Encouraging integrated planning approaches that take into account the interdependencies between water, energy, and food systems, and promote collaboration among stakeholders. II. Promoting education and awareness among stakeholders, such as farmers, policymakers, and the general public, about the benefits of sustainable resource management in the solar, agriculture, and water nexus.
