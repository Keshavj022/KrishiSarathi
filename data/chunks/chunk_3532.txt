 Fruit bagging before 60 days of harvesting using brown paper bags reduces the incidence of anthracnose and stem-end rot in mango. Environmental Conditions Fruit bagging also shields fruits from adverse environmental conditions. Extreme weather, such as heavy Ishu Kumari, A K Singh and Jitendra Singh Shivran Technology Indian Horticulture 10 Infestation of sooty mold in mango Fruit damage due to hail storm rain, hail, or excessive sunlight, can cause fruit cracking, sunburn, or blemishes. By covering the fruit with bags, growers can mitigate these issues, ensuring that the fruit remains intact and free from cosmetic damage. Pre harvest bagged litchi fruit were free from blemishes due to a low incidence of sunburn and fruit-cracking. Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal Consumers are becoming increasingly discerning when it comes to the appearance of fruits. Fruit bagging plays a crucial role in ensuring that fruits remain blemish- free, unmarked, and aesthetically appealing. Bagging helps prevent scarring, sunburn, and wind damage, which can significantly impact the market value of fruits. As a result, fruit growers can command higher prices for bagged fruits, which are often preferred in premium markets. Pre-harvest bagging of ‘Doyenne du Comice’ pear increased the fruit acceptability for export primarily by minimizing bird damage and skin blemishes. Consistent Ripening Fruit bagging regulates the fruit’s exposure to sunlight, resulting in more consistent ripening. Fruits that ripen uniformly have a better taste and texture, making them more appealing to consumers. This uniform ripening also allows for better planning of harvest times, reducing post- harvest losses and waste. Improved Fruit Quality The protection offered by fruit bagging extends beyond physical defense; it also affects fruit development. Bagged fruits tend to have higher sugar content, improved flavour, and increased nutritional value. This is because the bags create a microenvironment that enhances the photosynthesis process, ultimately leading to better fruit quality. Sweetness in ‘Granny Smith’ apple fruit was improved by bagging in brown paper bags at the golf-ball size of fruit development. Better Fruit Size and Shape Fruit bagging encourages uniform growth and prevents fruit deformation. The consistent shading provided by the bags helps maintain the fruit’s size and shape, resulting in a more desirable and marketable product. Bagging of mango var. ‘Nam Dok Mai #4’ fruits with different wave length selective bags increased fruit weight, size and sphericity over un-bagged fruit. Reduces the Need for Chemicals Reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides is not only environmentally friendly but also healthier for consumers. Fruit bagging can minimize the need for chemical treatments, promoting sustainable and organic farming practices. Double layered bagged apple fruits had lower concentrations of heavy metals (Pb, Cd and Cr) and pesticide residues than non-bagged apple fruit.
