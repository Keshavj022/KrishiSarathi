 About 37% enhancement in nut yield was observed in the palms treated with Kalpa Vardhini @ 500 g/year in two splits. Integration of napier grass in coconut-based cropping: About 75% more fodder yield (Co 5 hybrid napier) was realized in coconut-based farming system with a productivity of 210 tonnes/ha through application of nutrients 90:30:24 NPK, recycling of organic inputs such as cow-dung slurry (3,750 litre/ha), vermicompost (2 tonnes/ha) after every cutting (6 times a year) in two equal splits at fortnightly intervals along with Azospirillum (3.5 kg/ha). Impact of tender nut harvesting on growth, productivity and energy efficiency: The impact of tender nut harvesting on growth and production of coconut palm was studied in red sandy loam soil. Harvesting of tender nut throughout the year recorded significantly more yield (187 tender nuts/palm) with 14 number of bunches/palm. Harvesting of mature nuts throughout the year showed reduced yield (97 mature nuts/palm) with 12 bunches/palm. The observations revealed that continuous harvest (at 210±7 days after inflorescence emergence) of nuts for tender nut water is ideal for increased nut yield. Further, 2.47% increased input energy had been converted to 72.8% increase in output energy due to tender nut harvesting throughout the year as compared High-density planting in litchi: In a high-density planting system in litchi, enhanced yield of fruits (17.28 tonnes/ha) under 6 m×4 m (400 plants/ha) planting was recorded. CROP MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 82 to harvesting only mature nuts highlighting the superiority of the practice. This is further supported by the significantly more net energy (77.1%), energy use efficiency (68.6%), energy productivity (68.6%) and energy profitability (72.8%) with tender nut harvesting over mature nut harvesting. Integration of honeybees in coconut plantations: A record yield of 198 nuts/palm/year could be obtained from ecological engineering with Kalpa Sankara hybrids realizing more than `1.5 lakh from 39 palms. About 7.1% increase in nut yield was observed after the installation of honey bee colonies. Vegetable crops Micronutrient management in vegetables: Foliar application (1 g/l) of crop group specific micronutrient formulations three times at 10 days intervals after 30 days of planting enhanced the yield of French bean cv. Kashi Sampann by 13.8 to 20.8% over non-sprayed control. Organic production of vegetables: The maximum green leaf yield of coriander (9.83 tonnes/ha) and root yield of radish (43.2 tonnes/ha) with net return `81,652 and B:C ratio of 1.78 was obtained with application of 20 tonnes/ha FYM + 100:60:60 kg NPK/ha + IIHR microbial consortium @ 12.5 kg/ha + plant protection through organic methods. Hence, the above organic package was recommended for production of radish and coriander in Agro-climatic Zone-IV.
