Quaternary Science Advances 13 (2024) 100155 5 distilled water and heavy liquid flotation was performed using a solution of cadmium iodide and potassium iodide at specific gravity 2.3. A minimum count of 400 phytoliths was achieved in most samples and phytolith morphotypes were categorised using standard classifications (International Committee for Phytolith Taxonomy (ICPT) et al., 2019). Photographs were taken on a Leica DM 2500 microscope (400 × ). Cluster analysis was performed using CONISS in Tilia (Grimm, 1987). A total of 19 phytolith morphotypes were identified, including grass and non-grass phytoliths. A humidity/aridity index or Iph (%) suitable for tropical environments was calculated based on the ratio of chloridoid type phytoliths to the sum of panicoid and chloridoid types. Typically an Iph value of <30% suggests humid conditions and a value of >30% suggests arid conditions (Twiss, 1992). 4. Results 4.1. Chronology of Vadnagar Based on the radiometric dates (Table 1; Fig. 3) and archaeological materials, three broad phases comprising a number of historic or dynastic sub-phases have been identified: the Historic Phase I at the site ranges 200 BCE−500 CE comprising the Pre-Rampart to Kshatrapa sub- phases, the Medieval Phase II ranges 500−1300 CE (Post-Kshatrapa and Solanki sub-phases) and the Post-Medieval Phase III ranges 1300−1850 CE (Mughal and Gaekwad sub-phases). These find agreement with other published site chronologies (Agnihotri et al., 2021). Fig. 3. Calibrated radiocarbon probability ranges. Fig. 4.
