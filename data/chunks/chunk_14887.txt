 Arid areas of the Thar lie to the West of the Vindhya Ranges in India. Western Rajasthan is arid and has desert loam soils. Soil should have adequate fertility in order to be utilized for production of crops. Generally dung or ordure is added to enhance soil fertility (Chandra, 2005). Compost of plant materials is also added to attain similar fertility enhancements (Haug, 1980). It is advantageous, if the soil and carbonaceous mixtures are pressed together, organically protected and into arid soils (Satankar et al., 2017). This hybrid composite plays an important role in soil quality revival and waste management. Apart from ecological advantage, such hybrid composites enhance the value of animal waste (Thakur et al., 2013). Ceramics from mud and organic materials are also used to produce functional ceramics which help water ﬁltration (Plappally and Lienhard, 2013). Similar ceramic devices namely the G ﬁlter is also molded and baked by local hereditary potter families of this region. Further they also manufacture the cruse for water storage. This article discusses the soil based blends or immingles speciﬁc to western Rajasthan, India. It is important to know the geographic location where these materials are used. For clarity, the geographical position in focus is bounded on the east and west between latitudes 261480 56.4200N and 271 250 15.1800N and longitudes 691330 18.9500E and 7414202.0200E. Further latitudes 281310 38.65 N and 231 40011.01300N and longitudes 721 17036.9800 E and 731330 13.9100E respectively bound the region in the north and south. It is said that accumulation of sea water occurred in this area during the post tertiary era (CGWB, 2008). Recent report conﬁrms that Pachpadra town in this area was one of the three major salt lakes in Western Rajasthan (CGWB, 2008). Speciﬁc conductance of soil here ranges between 385 to 46,580 micro mhos/cm. at 251C (CGWB, 2008). Luni river which disappears into the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, India ﬂows through the Thar Desert in Rajasthan. Luni (in local Marwari dialect) means salt and thus rever- berates presence of salt in the region. Soil-Carbonaceous Matter Immingle (SCMI) The soils with clayey nature are appended with carbonaceous matter for utility in different traditional products, devices, practices, and processes. Most of the compositions are heterogeneous. In Rajasthan, the soil-carbonaceous matter immingle (SCMI) ﬁnds its use in household construction, soil and water use management. A similitude in the compositional ratio of composites and ceramics thus manufactured from these immingles are shown in Fig. 1. SCMI for Surface Finish Traditionally, soil-cow dung paste is applied on walls, ﬂoors, kilns, and earthen stoves as a ﬁnishing coat or cleansing coat across households in India. This coat is considered as a benchmark of daily cleaning activity of rural households in India. The wall ﬁnishing process shown in Fig. 2 is a low cost operation usually performed by local women.
