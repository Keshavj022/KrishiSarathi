 NRM 6 i Name of the Applicant Indian Society of Soil Salinity and Water Quality, CSSRI, Karnal in collaboration with Swami Keshwanand Rajasthan Agricultural University, Bikaner (Rajasthan) 39 ii Title National Seminar on Climate Resilient Saline Agriculture: sustaining livelihood security iii Venue and Date(s) 21-22 January 2017 at Bikaner (Rajasthan) iv Amount of grant by ICAR Rs. 2.50 Lakhs v ICAR's Sanction no. F.No.23(46)/2016-Cdn(Tech) vi Recommendation:   Agro-climatic regions based drainage guidelines to take care of variations in design parameters and consequent costs of sub-surface drainage systems are required for faster implementation of SSD projects and reclamation of water logged saline soils.   Biodiversity conservation needs to be integrated with possible impacts of changing climate to ensure long term sustainability of reclamation and management of SAS and PQW in inland and coastal regions.   Synergy among Nano-bio and phyto-remediation and sensor based precision technologies and plant growth promoting microbes and their consortia should get priority for reclamation and management of SAS.   Use of CSR-BIO PLUS for fertilizer saving and endophytes should be done for in-vitro bio- hardening for successful cultivation of banana in reclaimed sodic soils.   Resource Conservation Technologies (RCTs) need to be utilized to sustain crop production in Western Rajasthan. Multi-purpose and potential trees such as Drum stick (Moringa oleifera) which is highly nutritive vegetable and good fodder need to be worked out for dry ecologies.
