 Wheat: VL Gehun 953 a high yielding wheat variety was released for timely sown irrigated organic conditions of Uttarakhand hills as well as timely sown irrigated conditions of Uttarakhand Plains. It has an average yield potential of 3,341 kg/ha in hills and 4,474 kg/ha in Plains. The variety possesses high degree of resistance to yellow and brown rust. Barley: VLB 94 a high yielding disease resistant barley variety having an average yield potential of 1,830 kg/ha was released for cultivation under timely sown rainfed organic condition of Uttarakhand hills. VLB 94 is resistant to yellow rust and stripe disease of barley. It has medium sized (35 g Test weight), hulled yellow color grain. Biodiversity among zinc solubilizing bacteria: Bacterial isolates (83) were isolated from rhizosphere/ rhizoplane/ endorhizosphere of wheat cultivars and screened for zinc solubilization. Three isolates W5Rp75, W4Rp74 and W2Rs25 showed maximum Zn solubilization in 0.5% of ZnO, ZnCO3 and Zn3 (PO4)2 VL Dhan 156 VL Mandua 348 Central Maize VL Sweet Corn VL Bhat 201 VLS 77 VL Gehun 953 VLB 94 DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 129 RESEARCH FOR TRIBAL AND HILL REGIONS DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 130 amended minimal medium. In LB broth with tryptophan, 5 bacterial isolates showed IAA production in the range of 0.103-0.165 μg/ml after 42 hr of incubation at 28ºC. All the isolates were able to grow at temperatures 4, 15, and 28ºC with optimal growth at 28ºC. Three isolates (W5Rs70, W4ERs71 and W3ERs78) were able to tolerate salt concentration up to 8%. Ten isolates selected from the above experiments, were characterized on the basis of morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. The composite dendrogram revealed that isolate W1ERs55 and W4Rp44 showed maximum diversity among the elite PGP bacterial isolates and isolates W3ERs78, W5Rs70, W4Rp77 and W2Rs25 showed maximum diversity among the 10 elite PGP bacterial isolates. Rice variety- TRC 2013-2/IET 23947: This is found suitable for cultivation under irrigated as well as rainfed shallow lowland ecosystems of Uttarakhand. Occupational health hazards in wheat production system: A study carried out to assess occupational health hazards and drudgery as perceived by women while carrying out different activities in a wheat production system, revealed that harvesting activity was perceived as the most hazard prone activity closely followed by threshing, manure application, winnowing, transporting. The cumulative score for perceived drudgery in wheat production system was highest for threshing followed by transporting manure/produce and harvesting. None of the respondents was using personal protective equipments (PPE) while carrying out different farm activities. Based on these findings, awareness programme for use of PPE and improved tools was initiated among the farm women. Training-based interventions on agricultural health and safety would be planned to reduce the incidence of health hazards.
