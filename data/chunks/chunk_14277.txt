7 were considered poor, and the values between 0.5 and 0.6 were considered failed (Bradley, 1997; Sarkar et al., 2022). 3.2.3.2. Accuracy measurement. Accuracy is defined as the degree to which the outcome of measurement corresponds to the correct value or a standard and refers to the degree to which a measurement is near to its agreed-upon value, i.e., it is the degree of consistency between the outcome of measurement and the true value of the thing being measured. Equation 16 was used to measure the accuracy of the final outputs. The flow diagram and soil testing processes of the whole study area are in Fig. 2. Accuracyoverall = ( ( ∑true values) ( ∑predicted values) ) × 100 (15) 4. Result analysis 4.1. Execution of the AHP method for estimating relative weights of the variables All the selected sixteen different variables including nitrogen (N), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), sulphur (S), boron (B), phos­ phate, and potassium (K), electrical conductivity (EC), Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), soil pH, bulk density, soil moisture, soil organic carbon, soil depth, and soil texture have been classified into suitable classes based on natural break classification in GIS environment. The Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation (Chen and Liu, 2012) technique has been used to generate spatial distribution maps. The spatial distribution of nitrogen (N) has been categorised (Fig. 3a) into five potential classes based on natural break classification (Febrianto et al., 2016) in the GIS environment, where the >70 Zone has the most potential, with 20.83 per cent (21832.44 ha) area. The 1.64–1.98 copper (Cu) Zone (Fig. 3b) is more suitable, with an 11.79 per cent (12354.32 ha) area. The thematic distribution of manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) is (Fig. 3c; Fig. 3d) also classified into five classes, where the 16.37–19.98 Mn Zone and the 0.87–0.99 Zn Zone have more po­ tential, with 15.23 per cent (15955.27 ha) and 5.95 per cent (6234.64 ha) of the total area, respectively. The spatial database of the Sulphur (Fig. 3e) has been classified as 67.36–71.85, 71.85–79.76, 79.76–87.00, 87.00–96.01, and 96.01–113.36, respectively. Boron Zone 0.32–0.36 (Fig. 3f) has the most potential, with a 13.31 per cent (13951.9 ha) area. The Phosphate (Fig. 3g) Zone 255.74–310.30 has the most potential, Table 5 Normalised pair-wise comparison matrix with criteria rating, CI and CR, AHP and FCOPRAS Weights.
