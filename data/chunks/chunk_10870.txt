Provide ventilation for free circulation of air in the sheds.   Provide green fodder/silage/concentrates during day time and roughages/hay during night time during high temperature periods   Roughages (air dry basis) for computation of ration for dairy cattle should contain not less than 1% and not more than 2% of cow live weight   Allow animals to graze early in morning or later in evening.   Provide clean drinking water throughout the day and mineral mixture in the feed.   Prepare feed with locally available ingredients like jowar, maize, ragi, bajra, broken seed and coat of pulses and oil cakes ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 151   Identify and quarantine sick animals and sanitize animal sheds.   Vaccinate animals for specific diseases according to seasons.   Encourage farmers for periodic deworming in livestock.
