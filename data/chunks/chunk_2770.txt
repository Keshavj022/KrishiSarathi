 g) No primers were available for BN Bt. h) The results (ELISA print-out and gel photographs) were communicated, to Dr V. V. Singh, Dr Sumanbala Singh and Dr B. M. Khadi immediately after the tests. 8. What was the sonrce of these samples, i.e., who provided these samples? The names ofscientists who sent the samples to the Bt ReferraVtesting Lab have been mentioned above. Source ofthe samples may please be obtained from Dr B. M. Khadi. 9. What were the results? Results presented above 10. We understand that these samples were also tested for presence ofMON 531 event. What prompted to test the samples for presence ofMON 531 event when it was not done in previous years, i.e., from 2001-2004? The samples tested on 911> December 2002 were only tested through ELISA for the presence ofCry1Ac protein-toxin as requested by Dr KhadiIDr KatageriIVamadevaiah. - ,- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ... - - - - - - Dr Khadi requested for crylAc specific PCR test in August 2005. The crylAc specific primers used in the referral laboratory were actually specific for a region at 2619 bp to 3117bp in the full length 3534 bp crylAc gene ofMonsanto's Mon 531 event. These primers were used routinely in the lab with the samples in PCR tests carried out on 21-8- 2005. The primers were designed in the Bt-referral lab for routine testing of Monsanto's Bt-cotton. It was realized later that the amplicon was not expected to have been present in the truncated 1848 bp crylAc gene used in BN-Bt. Therefore PeR tests were conducted on 27-9-2005 with Mon 531 5'-junction region specific primers on 10 samples that had been previously tested positive for crylAc on 21-8-2005. All the samples that were positive for the crylAc gene were also found to be positive for Mon53 I -5'junction region. Subsequently 37 samples were tested on 29-9-2005 for the 'three-primer Mon 531 event specific test'. Six samples were homozygous for Mon 531. n. Were the results communicated to Dr Khadi and/or Dr Katageri? Were communicated, verbally or in writing? Ifnot in writing, why? The results were communicated to Dr B. M. Khadi verbally as well as the result sheets were given to him. The gel pictures were shown and the implications were explained clearly. The Bt-testing laboratory facilities at the institute are used commonly to assist scientists in their work. There is no such practice at the institute to prepare a written report for internal samples provided by scientist colleagues. However result sheets are provided and verbal communication is done normally as was done in this case. 12. Did 'Bt referral Laboratory' test the samples between 2005-2008? What were the results? Were the results communicated to the concerned? Samples for DNA tests were NOT received by the Bt referral laboratory after 11-10-2005 and before 26-4-2008. ELISA tests may have been done sometimes since the laboratory assists all the scientists ofthe institute for Bt ELISA testing routinely. 13.
