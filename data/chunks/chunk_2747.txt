II. Were your experimental material in different generations grown in a plot having the required isolation, i.e., 50 m? All experimental material in different generations were grown with a minimum isolation distance of 50M. 12. Was there any possibility of contamination of your material with MON 531 event during the advancement of generations? A minimum of 50M isolation distance was maintained in all the generations between BN Bt and Mon 531 experiments. However, the possibility of contamination may not be ruled out due to the activity of honey bees near vicinity, handling of material by labourers I field assistants during harvesting, storing, ginning, cleaning etc. 13. How did you select the material for advancement of generation? On the basis of presence of your event or on the basis ofexpression of Cry protein? Advancement ofgenerations was made as follows: To- TI - Tz: Based on expression of Cry 1 Ac. Tz- T]: Based on PCR and southern. T] - T4 : Based on expression of CrylAc (Bt strip test) T4 - T5 : Based on expression of CrylAc (Bt strip test) and Homozygosity test report ofBangalore Genie Private Ltd., Bangalore. Ts - Ts: : Based on expression of Cry1Ac (Bt strip test) Ts - Ts: Seed production, not carried out any tests. 14 In your opinion, was there any deficiency in follow up of procedure in course of development of BN Bt? There was n't any deficiency in transformation methodology hut the procedure to differentiate between BN Bt event and Mon 531 event was not known to us. 15.
