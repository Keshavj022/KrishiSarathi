D. Sahoo et al. Farming System 3 (2025) 100124 13 technology adoption policies to incentivize and facilitate the uptake of CSAT among farmers. Second, the study emphasizes the importance of customizing CSAT interventions to suit the unique contexts of different regions, highlighting the requirement for needs assessments and tailored solutions to maximize their impact on farmers' well-being. Third, it brings attention to the role of social capital in inﬂuencing farmers’ happiness, indicating the signiﬁcance of fostering community cohesion, promoting collective action, and strengthening social networks to sup- port technology adoption and improve well-being. Fourth, the study underscores the challenge of land fragmentation as a barrier to CSAT adoption, calling for policy reforms to address land tenure issues and provide support mechanisms for smallholder farmers. Last, it emphasizes the importance of inclusive and equitable approaches to technology adoption, advocating for targeted interventions that reach marginalized groups such as indigenous tribes and households with limited land resources.
