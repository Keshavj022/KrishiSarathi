 Field Pea Being a winter season crop it requires a cool growing season with moderate temperature throughout the life. High temperature is more injurious to pea crop than frost. High humidity with cloudy weather results into spread of fungal diseases like damping-off and powdery mildew. Optimum monthly temperature suitable for growth is 13-18Â°C. A well-drained loamy soil free from excessive soluble salts with neutral pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 is suitable for successful cultivation of the crop. Prepare a level field for even distribution of irrigation water, one deep ploughing followed by 2-3 harrowing and planking after each operation. To ensure good drainage and aeration in the field, powdery seedbeds must be avoided. 15th October to 15th November is the best time of sowing. Require 70-80 kg. seed per ha and spacing 30-45 X10 cm for tall variety, semilarly, 100 kg. Seed per ha & spacing 22.5X10 cm dwarf varieties with 4-5 cm depth. Improved Varieties: Swati (KFPD-24), Malviya Matar-15 (HUDP- 15), Vikas, Sapna (KPMR-1441), IPF 4-9, HUDP 15 IPF 99-25 Malviya P-15 DPL 62 KPMR 522 KPMR 400 It can be sown as intercrop with autumn sugarcane as two rows of pea at 30 cm row spacing in the centre of two sugarcane rows at 90 cm apart. Field-pea is mostly grown as rainfed/un-irrigated on residual soil moisture and can sustain drought conditions up to some extent. One or two irrigations at 45 DAS and if needed, at pod filling stage, may be the best recommended irrigation schedule. Apply 20-30kg/ha nitrogen in tall types and 40kg/ha nitrogen in dwarf types as a starter dose of basal dressing. The phosphorus and potassic fertilizer should be apply as basal dose based on soil test ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 145 value. 20 kg Sulphur and 15 kg zinc sulphate per hectare should be applied. For control weed spraying Pendimethalin (STOMP) 30 EC @ 0.75-1 kg a.i./ha as pre-emergence and for post emergence apply Metribuzin 70 % WP @ 0.25 kg a.i./ha at 15-20 day after sowing in 400-600 liter of water. Seed Treatment with Thirum (2gm.) +Carbendazim (1gm.) /kg of seed. Powdery Mildew symptoms first appears on the leaves then on other green parts of the plant. Resistant var. like Pant Pea-5, Malviya-15, JP-885, HUP-2 etc. with timely sowing and spraying with Karathane @ 1 ml/litre or wettable sulphur @ 3 gm/litre of water and repeat after 10-15 days, if necessary. Rust is caused by fungus and control by spraying Mancozeb 75 WP @ 2 g / liter of water. Leaf Miner: Larvae of the insect makes tunnel in the leaf causing severe damage in the month of Dec.to March. Spraying Oxydemeton methyl (Metasystox) 25 EC one litre in 1000 liter of water per hectare for its control. Fully ripe and threshed after sufficient drying in the sun. The clean seed may be sun dried for 3-4 days to reduce their moisture content up to 9-10% to be safely stored in appropriate bins. 20-25qtls of grain and straw per ha (irrigated) and 10-15 qtls grains per ha (rain fed) condition.
