After 2 months the compost becomes ready. This compost (5 g) is added to each plant once at the time of sowing and at 45 days after planting. Due to its repellent action, incidence of shoot and fruit borer is reduced. : Shri Bivison Pradhan, Badakodanda, Bhanjanagar, Ganjam, (Orissa) 761 126 Badakodanda, Bhanjanagar.Ganjam (Orissa) 761 126 OUAT, Bhubaneshwar 1.

These were conducted at village Badakodanda, Bhanjanagar, dist. Ganjam, Orissa. Experiment The experiment was conducted by OUAT at two sites at (i) Badakodanda village, and (ii) KVK, Bhanjanagar, with three treatments: (i) kochila-mixed cowdung compost applied @ 5 g/plant at planting and @ 10 g/plant after 45 days of transplanting (ITK method); (ii) chemical pesticide (granular) at planting @ 10 kg a.i./ha, monocrotophos 15 days after transplanting, endosulfan 15 days after transplanting, Nukil 60 days after transplanting and Sevin-75 days after transplanting; and (iii) without any treatment (control). The experiment was laid out in CRD with 15 replications. The variety used was Bhanjanagar Local. Observations were taken on: (i) percentage Contents HORTICULTURAL CROPS Shoot borer in brinjal of shoot infestation; (ii) percentage of fruit infestation; (iii) fruit weight; (iv) number of fruits/ plant; (v) yield of fruits/plant; (vi) fruit taste; (vii) fruit yield/ha; and (viii) marketable fruit yield. The experiment conducted in 2002-03 was repeated in the village Badakodanda during 2003- 04 following the same package of practices. BCKV conducted the experiment in 2004. An Fruit borer in brinjal additional treatment was imposed with tobacco- soaked water, whereas the three other treatments were the same as that of OUAT.
