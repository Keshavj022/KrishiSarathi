5 kg/ha seedlings before transplanting. Wet seeded puddled Lowland Rice yy Apply N and K as 25% each at 21 DAS, at active tillering, PI and heading stages. 202 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy If N applied through LCC, use the critical value 4 for line sown drill seeded rice. yy Entire P as basal applied in the last plough or at the time of incorporation of green manure/ compost. Dry seeded Rainfed Un-Puddled Lowland Rice yy Blanket recommendation: 50:25:25 kg N:P2O5:K2O /ha yy Apply a basal dose of 750 kg of FYM enriched with fertilizer phosphorus (P at 25 kg/ha) yy Apply N and K in two equal splits at 20 - 25 and 40 - 45 days after germination. yy If the moisture availability from the tillering phase is substantial, three splits (25 kg N and 12.5 kg K at 20-25, 40-45 and 60-65 DAG) can be adopted. yy Basal application of FeSO4 at 50 kg/ha is desirable for iron deficient soil (or) apply TNAU Rainfed rice MN mixture @12.5 kg/ha as EFYM at 1:10 ratio incubated for 30 days at friable moisture. Semidry/Rainfed rice yy Apply 25 kg ZnSO4 ha-1 and 50 kg FeSO4 ha-1 along with available organic manure when the soil is deficient in Zn or Fe. yy After the establishment of crop, if the deficiency is observed in plants foliar spraying of 0.50% ZnSO4 or 1.0% FeSO4 + 0.10% citric acid on 15, 25 & 35 DAS may be given for alleviating the respective nutrient deficiencies. Dry Seeded Rainfed Un-Puddled Lowland Rice with Supplemental Irrigation yy Apply recommended dose of fertilizer 75:25:37.5 kg N:P2O5:K2O /ha yy Apply a basal dose of 750 kg of FYM enriched with fertilizer phosphorus (P at 25 kg/ha) yy Apply N & K in three splits at 20-25, 40-45 and 60-65 days after germination. 203 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy Each split may follow 25kg N and 12.5 kg K2O. yy If the moisture availability is substantial, split application at panicle initiation may be done with 40 kg N and 12.5 kg K2O. yy If the moisture availability is substantial, the split at 40-45 DAS (panicle initiation) may be applied up to 40kg N and 12.5kg K2O to enhance the growth and the grain yield. Dry seeded irrigated Un-puddled Lowland Rice yy Apply FYM/compost at 12.5 t/ha or 750 kg of FYM enriched with 50 kg P2O5 as basal dose in clay soils of Nagapattinam / Tiruvarur district. yy Apply recommended dose of fertilizer 75:50:37.5 kg N:P2O5:K2O /ha yy N and K in three splits at around 20-25, 40-45 and 60-65 days for short duration varieties or four splits for medium duration varieties at around 20-25, 40-45, 60-65 and 80-85 days after germination is suitable. yy Each split may follow 25kg N and 12.5 kg K2O. yy If the moisture availability is substantial and canal water received from tillering phases itself, the split at panicle initiation (40-45 DAS in short duration and 60-65 DAS in medium duration) may be applied up to 40kg N and 12.5kg K2O to enhance the growth and the grain yield.
