 Technology was the driver of the Green Revolution as about 80% of the production gains were attributed to yield enhancements. The intensified efforts in oilseed crop research post Technology Mission on Oilseeds (TMO) in 1986 resulted in Yellow Revolution with a quantum jump in edible oil production from 10.8 Mt (1985-86) to 24.7 Mt (1998-99). Just in a decade period from 1985 to 1996, area under oilseed cultivation increased from 19.0 to 26.0 Mha. To achieve similar boost in pulses production, they were brought under TMO in 1991. The continued efforts for about three decades in pulses brought ‘Pulse Revolution’ by providing near self-sufficiency in pulses in the late 2010s (Yadav et al. 2019). The production of pulses, which remained almost constant at 14-15 Mt till 2014-15, jumped to 25.72 Mt (2020-21). India also witnessed Sugar Revolution with sugarcane production increased from 57.05 Mt (1950-51) to 405.42 Mt (2019-20). In independent India, 115 improved varieties have been developed which helped in the steady increase of sugarcane production with improved sugar recovery. ICAR has released more than 6000 varieties for cereals, oilseeds, pulses, fibre crops, forage crops, sugar crops and other crops. This list includes 55 varieties developed through marker-assisted selection to fulfil the various requirement of the farmers. In recent years (2014-21), 1575 high yielding varieties of field crops were released, more than 1300 varieties of which are climate resilient. Specific traits such as drought and sub-mergence tolerance, disease resistance and improved nutrition quality have been introgressed in 47 varieties of field crops using genomic tools like marker assisted Indian Agriculture after Independence 12 selection. During this period, 87 crop varieties either bio-fortified with higher levels of Fe, Zn, protein or pro-vitamin A were developed. ICAR, the nodal agency for coordination of Breeder Seed production, has played a catalytic role in transforming the seed chain in the country by increasing the production of breeder seed of new varieties, pushing the varietal as well as seed replacement rate in pulses, oilseeds and cereals substantially over time. One important milestone of ICAR is the development of internationally consumer preferred and trade favoured Basmati rice, for its cooking and eating quality. About 90% of Basmati rice trade in global market is shared by India with export earnings of Rs. 32,806 crores in 2018-19. The Council has developed genomic resources of 16 commodities and successfully used genome editing in mega rice cultivar MUT1010, Pusa 44 and Pusa Basmati 1. The details of the achievements in the field crop sector are presented in Chapter 5. Fig. 3. Postal stamp to commemorate the Green Revolution 4.2.
