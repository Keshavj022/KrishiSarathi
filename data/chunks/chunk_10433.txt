 Roller flour mills were introduced in 1960s and their number reached to 200 by 1970. They became so popular that their number increased by 35 times by 2000. Introduction of hammer mills increased versatility of the machines since they could also be used easily for variety of products including spices and also for wet-grinding. In the decade of 1980 hammer mills of house- hold capacity were introduced in the market. Variety of gadgets was in use in different parts of the country to mill rice from paddy. By the year 2000 there were approximately 0.1 million hullers/shellers and about 30,000 modern rice mills in operation. In the year 2016 Achievements in Agricultural Engineering in Independent India 289 there were nearly 1.30 lakh modern rice mills in operation with significant contributions of ICAR scientists. The mobile mini rice mills operated by tractor PTO (power take off) have also been introduced in 2019 with input from ICAR institutions and collaborations with private companies. Stones-based burr mills have been used traditionally for milling of pulses into dal. Emery roller mill-based machines were introduced at the time of independence and by 1950 around 500 dal mills were in operation. It was estimated during 2001 that there were around 12,000 dal mills in operation. The industry has been using custom made emery rollers for milling of dal and polishing of rice. In 2002, ICAR introduced use of pre-fabricated emery stones for dal milling, which is now popularized for both rice polishing and dal milling. Extraction of oil from oilseeds involved use of animal driven cold presses (Kachchi Ghanis) during pre-independence and early post-independence periods. Gradual replacement of these with screw type oil expeller started in 1970s. In 2018, there were approximately 15,000 oil mills, 600 solvent extraction plants, 465 vegetable oil refineries and 250 hydrogenated vegetable oil (Vanaspati) processing units in operation. R & D work of ICAR institutes in improvement of processing and machinery in these fields are commendable. The perishable horticultural commodities were not processed traditionally at commercial level except for drying, pickle making and some ready to eat products. Even the fresh products were handled in bamboo baskets, gunny bags or transported bulk in open carts or carriers. Large scale adoption of plastic crates for handling of fruits and vegetables started in late 1990s, whereas some fruits were packaged in wooden boxes/crates, the practice is still on. The cardboard/ paper boxes were also introduced for packaging of grapes and some other fruits and vegetables in 1990s. Research and development on post-harvest processing and value additions was in nascent stage for a long time in the country. It started with opening of some agricultural engineering colleges/departments in 1960s and actually has taken a lift during 1980s.
