 In severe cases, these symptoms resulted in the dieback of aﬀected trees. The symptoms observed in this study are the same as those previously reported by many authors [9,18,27]. Isolates were successfully identiﬁed based on morphological traits and sequencing of the ITS region of the DNA. Seven Phytophthora species, representing four of the twelve major Phytophthora clades, were identiﬁed. These include P. palmivora, P. plurivora, P. acerina, P. oleae, P. cactorum, P. gonapodyides, and P. megasperma. In regard to the genus Pythium s.l., three species were identiﬁed, including P. schmitthenneri, P. aphanidermatum, and P. irregulare, each belonging to distinct ITS clades. The detection of 10 distinct species across two genera of the family Phytiaceae in Moroccan olive-growing regions highlights the complexity of root rot disease etiology. These ﬁndings strongly suggest that diﬀerent Phytophthora and Pythium s.l. species can produce similar symptoms in olive trees. Among these pathogens, P. palmivora, a member of clade 4, has been identiﬁed as the causative agent of root rot disease in several major olive-producing regions worldwide, ﬁrst reported in Spain by Sánchez-Hernández et al. [36]. Since then, it has been documented in other olive-producing regions, including Italy [37–40], Tunisia [41], Agriculture 2025, 15, 435 10 of 15 Argentina [42], and Australia [43]. In Morocco, P. palmivora was ﬁrst reported by Chliyeh et al. in 2013 [44] as a causative agent of root rot in the northwestern region of the country. In our study, three species within clade 2, P. plurivora, P. acerina, and P. oleae, were identiﬁed. P. plurivora is a polyphagous pathogen with a broad host range, including members of the Betulaceae, Fagaceae, and Oleaceae families, in both natural ecosystems and agricultural settings [45,46]. This species was ﬁrst reported in olive trees in Northern Italy (Veneto) in 2018 [47]. A few years later, this polyphagous species was found on olive in other regions of the country [20]. Similarly, P. acerina was described in 2018 as an agent causing sudden death to olive trees in Italy [47]. The high virulence displayed by P. acerina in inoculation tests on olive saplings highlights its potential as an extremely aggressive pathogen [20]. However, its geographic distribution and host range remain poorly understood. Phytophthora oleae, originally identiﬁed as a causal agent of rot on mature olive fruits in Southern Italy [48], has also been associated with root rot in wild olive trees in Spain [49] and the dieback of wild olive trees in Sardinia (Italy) [50]. Moreover, this species was recovered from the soil of a typical Mediterrenean plant community, also encompassing olive (Oleo-Quercetum virgilianae) in a nature reserve in Sicily (southern Italy) [51]. As reported by Linaldeddu et al. [20], P. oleae is one of the most prevalent pathogens involved in root rot symptoms.
