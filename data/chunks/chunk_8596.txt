 Improvement was also observed in per cent conception and calving pooled over breeds and years, 63.98% and 73.42%, respectively. Highest calving percentage was observed in Kachchhi (81.82%) followed by Bikaneri (72.22%) and Jaisalmeri (81.82%) breeds. Analysis of gestation length indicated significant breed effect. The gestation length in Bikaneri, Jaisalmeri and Kachchhi females was 390.04 ± 0.73, 389.54 ± 1.12 and 384.04 ± 1.12 days respectively. The calving interval, pooled over breeds, was 715.50 ± 8.46 days. The year to year variation in the gestation length and calving interval was significant. YAK Preliminary survey in Sikkim and Jammu and Kashmir revealed conditions of yak husbandry akin to that of Arunachal Pradesh. ANIMAL HEALTH Foot- and-mouth Disease Antigenic analysis revealed that 32% of the FMDV type O field isolates recovered in the year 2002, are antigenically different from the vaccine strain IND R2/75, indicating an upsurge in the number of such heterologous strains in the field. However, in type Asia 1, majority (>95%) of the field isolates collected during the last 3 years indicated adequate serological relationships (r value > 0.4) with the vaccine strain IND 63/72. In type A, 64% of the isolates are antigenically divergent (r value < 0.20) from the two vaccine strains (IND 17/77 and IND 490/97 [WBN 17/82]) used in the country. Of the two genotypes of ‘A’ presently co-circulating, genotype VII gave a better antigenic coverage (r value > 0.40) to 64% of the isolates compared to genotype VI (r value 0.40 and above) that gave coverage to 24% of the isolates. Genetic analysis of type O FMDV field isolates indicated emergence of a new group which is about 8% divergent at the nucleotide level from hitherto predominant Pan-Asia group. The newly emerged strain overtook the well- established Pan-Asia strain and was responsible for type O FMD outbreaks in 11 states. In Asia 1, 1D gene-based analysis indicated the prevalence of co-circulating genotypes A and B, and the later is widely circulating and majority of the recently l Upsurge in heterologous strains of FMD observed. l Indigenously developed C-ELISA kit. for rinderpest was validated by IAEA,Vienna. l IBR continues to be the major herd problem. l India.AdmasEpitrak software was made more user friendly. l PCR for amplification of RNA gene of Theileria annulata standardized. l Repository of Pasteurella multocida isolates established. l Faecal egg count reduction test revealed resistance against albendazole in sheep infected with haemonchosis. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 110 sampled isolates formed a separate group within this genotype and are > 9% nucleotide divergent from the remaining isolates. Sequencing of the capsid-coding region of type A isolates revealed that genetic recombination is another mechanism of genetic and antigenic divergence. Recombination between strains of a serotype could be a ploy by the virus to evade immune response.
