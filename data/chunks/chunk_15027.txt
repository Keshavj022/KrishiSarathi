 17 I provide details on the construction of incidental treatment and control groups in Appendix C. inputs and procure farm output respectively. Prior work on rural roads has largely focused on effects deriving from direct connections, ignor- ing potentially important spillovers to other villages in the network. Second, given that incidentally treated villages are program-ineligible, they abstract from program rules that govern the timing of road provi- sion. Any deviations in project implementation from program rules, for example, as a political favor, could bias estimates of direct connections, but incidental connections would not be susceptible to this bias. Third, it can help inform the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of road infrastructure on agricultural production by allowing me to rule out several classes of channels that might be at play — I discuss this further in Section 7. 5.2. Difference-in-differences specification I estimate the effects of improved rural road infrastructure on a set of household-level outcomes in a difference-in-differences framework, where I compare the evolution of outcomes for households in villages that have received a program road to households in villages that have yet to receive a program road. Direct Connections. The most basic estimating equation restricts the sample to program-eligible villages and takes the form: 𝑦𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡= 𝛽𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡+ 𝜌𝑖+ 𝛾𝑠𝑡+ 𝜖𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡 (1) 𝑦𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡is the outcome variable of interest for household 𝑖in village 𝑣and state 𝑠at time 𝑡; 𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣is an indicator that equals 1 if program-eligible village 𝑣receives a program road by 2006; 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡is an indicator for the survey wave in 2006; and 𝛽is the coefficient of interest.18 Any time-invariant household characteristics are absorbed by the household fixed effects 𝜌𝑖, and any annual shocks that are common across villages in a state are captured by the state-year fixed effects, 𝛾𝑠𝑡. To allow for serial correlation of 𝜖𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡within villages over time, I adjust the standard errors by clustering at the village level. In restricting the sample to program-eligible villages, I drop obser- vations from all program-ineligible villages, which are useful in esti- mating state-year fixed effects. To improve statistical power, I augment Eq. (1) to include this group: 𝑦𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡= 𝛼𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡+ 𝜁𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡+ 𝜌𝑖+ 𝛾𝑠𝑡+ 𝜖𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡 (2) 𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑣is an indicator that equals 1 if village 𝑣was deemed inel- igible for a program road. The coefficient of interest 𝛼is still estimated off the sample of program-eligible villages, as the 𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡in- teraction term absorbs changes in outcomes for the program-ineligible villages in the post period.
