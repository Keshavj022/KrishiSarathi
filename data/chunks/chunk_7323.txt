 The average sediment filtering efficiency was 95.14% and it ranged from 94.10% to 96.96% for different events. ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 12 SOIL AND WATER PRODUCTIVITY Its mean peak recharge rate was 6.0 l/s and sediment filtering efficiency was 90.73%. Automated drip fertigation: Automated drip fertigation in okra crop were evaluated for improving water use efficiency at Udaipur, Rajasthan. Different components of automated drip system were soil moisture sensor, controller, water meter and relay system. Irrigation water was applied automatically based on availability of soil moisture in the crop root zone sensed by soil moisture sensor. Crop performance was better with automated drip irrigation at 100% field capacity (FC) along with application of 100% recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) through fertigation in equal splits at 4 days interval. Under this treatment, okra yield was 8.60 t/ha and water use efficiency was 0.24 t/ha-cm. There was 41.6% total water saving and 109% higher crop yield compared to the control (i.e. water application through manual drip irrigation along with Automated drip fertigation for increasing water productivity of okra crop at Udaipur Integrated Farming System models established State Location IFS model Area Net income Employment (ha) (` in lakh/year) (man days) Andhra Pradesh Maruteru Field crops + horticulture + Ongole cow + 0.56 1.31 449 poultry + fish Gujarat Junagadh Field crops + horticulture + Gir cow + fish 0.50 0.88 317 Navsari Field crops + multi-storied horticulture + 0.60 0.83 300 farm pond Rajasthan Kota Field crops + 2-tier horticulture system + dairy 1.00 1.40 417 100% RDF through fertigation in equal splits at 6 days interval). Organic farming packages and models: Organic farming packages for 4 cropping systems suitable to Gujarat, Kerala, Rajasthan, Sikkim and Uttarakhand were developed as per National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) standards. Groundnut-wheat-green gram system registered 6.1 t/ha of groundnut equivalent yield with ` 1.43 lakh/ha as net returns while cassava- groundnut system in Kerala resulted in cassava tuber equivalent yield of 32 t/ha under organic production system. Fennel-cluster bean system recorded fennel equivalent yield 2.2 t/ha with net income and B:C ratio of ` 75,808/ha and 2.21 respectively. Under Sikkim conditions, maize + ginger – French bean resulted in 15 t/ha of maize equivalent yield with net return of ` 2.99 lakh/ha.
