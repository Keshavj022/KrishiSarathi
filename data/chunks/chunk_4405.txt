 The advent of hydroponics, precision farming, bio- sensors, fertigation, landscaping, application of ICT, GPS and GIS tools and micro-irrigation is in the horizon. This revised edition in two volumes covers fundamentals of the subject and at the same time will inspire and prepare teachers and students for the emerging frontiers.

Reasons/constraints for such low yields are non-availability of good quality seed, very high cost of seed and transportation if arranged from Punjab, Haryana or Uttar Pradesh, farmers’ ignorance about new technology due to poor extension work, presence of bacterial wilt/brown rot (Ralstonia solanacearum) in soil at several places, high population of aphids and white flies transmitting virus diseases, epidemics of late blight (Phytophthora infestans), potato leaf roll virus disease, insect pests like cutworms (Agrotis ipsilon), red ants (Dorylus spp), potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella), highly acidic soils, lack of storage facilities and potato being grown as rain fed crop, mainly. Considering all these factors, Utkal Tubers India Private Limited, Bengaluru (UTIPL) conducted a trial in a farmer’s field with sandy loam to silty loam soil in Manikapathar, Garmur, Majuli during autumn 2020-21 Ashok K Somani*, Devajit Borthakur, Sanjay Mahant and George Thomas Technology Potato production with quality seed and improved technology in Assam Assam is among the top 10 potato producing states of India but with very low yields due to several constraints. Utkal Tubers India Private Limited, Bengaluru conducted a trial in a farmer’s field in Assam with its seed and technology during 2020-21. Average yields of two varieties (K Pukhraj and K Jyoti) was 11.62 t/ acre (28.70 t/ha) and that of farmer’s local variety and traditional method, it was 3.8 t/acre (9.39 t/ha). In UTIPL’s case, yield is 3 times more than farmer’s own case and higher than national average with further scope to increase it. The study shows that there is tremendous scope for improving the yields in Assam with improved seed and technology. with its technology and quality seed with the objective to increase the yields. In this field trial, the farmer planted ware potato crop in 0.96 acre with UTIPL’s seed and technology under their supervision and grew on his own some local red variety (name not known to him also) with traditional method in 0.
