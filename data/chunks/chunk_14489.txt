 The fuzzy extent with respect to the ith object can be represented using Eq. (7). Vi = ∑ t j=1 Tj gi ⊗ [ ∑ n i=1 ∑ t j=1 Tj gi ]−1 (7) where, Tj gi represents the jth triangular fuzzy extent valuewhere, i = 1,2, 3, …,n; j = 1,2, 3, … …,t; and ‘t’ represents the total number of extent analysis fields for a considered object. To compute ∑t j=1Tj gi, fuzzy addition operation, as shown in Eq. (8), is performed ∑ m j=1 Tj gi = ( ∑ t j=1 αi, ∑ t j=1 βi, ∑ t j=1 γi ) (8) Further, to compute [∑n i=1 ∑t j=1Tj gi] −1, fuzzy addition operation, as shown in Eq. (9), is performed [ ∑ n i=1 ∑ t j=1 Tj gi ]−1 = ⎡ ⎢⎢⎣ 1 ∑ n i=1 γi , 1 ∑ n i=1 βi , 1 ∑ n i=1 αii ⎤ ⎥⎥⎦ (9) where, Vi is a normalized fuzzy number with medium values as unity and i = 1 … N (number of criteria). Step-5 The normalized fuzzy number in step-4 is further defuzzified into a crips number using mean method which can be expressed using Eq. (10). D = (α + β + γ) / 3 (10) 5. Empirical analysis and results This section provides insight into the overall weight of barrier cat­ egories and the barriers to the adoption of UAVs in the rural areas of India. As per the proposed methodology, the list of identified barriers grouped under each barrier category is shared with the expert panel. Subsequently, their perception2 on each of the identified barriers is Fig. 5. Proposed framework to identify and analyse the barriers to adopt UAVs. 2 Questionnaire used for collecting the responses is shown in Appendix-A. H. Puppala et al. Technology in Society 74 (2023) 102335 8 collected using a linguistic scale shown in Fig. 6. Subsequently, the obtained linguistic responses are translated into fuzzy numbers a representative fuzzy score by accumulating the responses from all the experts is determined using Eq. (3). The defuzzified score corresponding to the barriers are presented in Table .2. Considering the study of Puppala et al. (2022) [57], a threshold value of 0.6 is chosen as a cut-off value to classify the barriers into selected and un-selected categories. The list of barriers with a defuzzified score below 0.6 signifies that they are not relevant for adopting UAVs. Findings of Fuzzy Delphi as shown in Table .2 suggest that ‘Educational background’ and ‘Reliability of report’ are not relevant in the Indian context. These findings are coherent with the responses obtained in the survey con­ ducted as it is noted that a fraction of participants with no higher edu­ cation background expressed their willingness to adopt the technology. Further, the trust farmers have in technology, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, as expressed in the survey, makes the ‘reliability of report’ obsolete. Though the first phase of analysis using Fuzzy Delphi helped in categorizing the barriers into selected and un-selected groups, the relative hierarchy of barriers remains unmapped.
