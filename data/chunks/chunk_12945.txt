 • Identification of profitable potato-based cropping systems in different agro-climates, including inter- cropping of the potato with sugarcane, wheat and several crops. • Development of agricultural implements for mechanizing potato cultivation, including an oscillating tray type potato grader, fertilizer applicator-cum-line marker, potato culti-ridger, soil crust brakers, granular insecticide applicator, two/ four row automatic potato planter, and potato digger. • Development of integrated package of practices for management of late blight, bacterial wilt, viruses, and soil and tuber-borne diseases. • Development of Late blight forecasting model (Indo- blight cast) and Methodology for acreage and production estimation of potato using remote sensing, GIS and crop modelling. • Development of sensitive virus detection techniques and DBT Accredited lab for testing of virus freedom. • Development of techniques for storage of table and processing potatoes at elevated temperature and on- farm storage structures. • Technologies and technical support to industry for value addition including chips, french fries and other processed products. Contribution to agricultural economy Agriculture, including allied activities, contributed 13.9% of the GDP at constant prices (2004-05) in 2013- 14 while this sector still accounts for 54.6% of total employment in the country. Current share of potato to agricultural GDP is 2.86% out of 1.32% cultivable area. On the contrary, the two principal food crops, rice and wheat, contribute 18.25% and 8.22% of agricultural GDP, respectively from 31.19% and 20.56% cultivable area, respectively. It indicated that contribution of potato in agricultural GDP from unit area of cultivable land is about 3.7 times higher than rice and 5.4 times higher than wheat. Potato varieties developed by ICAR-Central Potato Research Institute are very popular among farmers and cover nearly 95% of total area under potato. India produced ~ 45.87 million tonnes of potato annually during the triennium 2014-17 and contributed ` 57,512 crore annually to the Gross Value Added (GVA) at current price. The varieties developed by ICAR-CPRI contributed ` 54,636 crore annually during this period. Four varieties, viz. Kufri Jyoti, Kufri Bahar, Kufri Pukhraj, and Kufri Chipsona 1 together contributed around 75% of total area under potato.

Thus nearly 293 million man-days of employment have been generated only for potato cultivation during 2013-14. Besides, large number of semi-skilled labour is required for carrying out post-harvest operations like transportation, storage, processing, marketing etc.
