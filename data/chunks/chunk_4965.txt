 The observations recorded were moisture content in soil and soil accumulation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Data recorded through PRA method are presented in Table 1. maximum by plugging it with stone or bricks and mud/ cement and it was superior over rest of the treatments. As reported by the farmers these practices were not adopted specially for controlling erosion but were part of their cultivation practices for growing crops along with protecting the soil and moisture loss, resulting in maintaining soil health for sustainable production of the crops. Experiment Data presented in Table 2 reveal that the highest soil moisture content (19.8%) was recorded when terracing and bunding were done in sloppy unbunded upland followed by land treated with mulching (19.5%). These were at par with the land treated with the cover crop. Plugging Table 1.

Results presented in Table 1 reveal that splash erosion was controlled (93) by growing cover crops which was at par with the treatment of filling up the cracks of land by wood ash (89). Sheet erosion was controlled maximum (86 score) through mulching which was at par with the treatment of filling the cracks by wood ash (85 score) and these two treatments were superior over rest of the treatments. Rill erosion was controlled by treatment of ploughing the land across the slope which was similar to the treatment of mulching having scores value (83) and these two treatments were superior over rest of the treatments. Gully erosion may be controlled Table 2.

Untreated plot had 16.5% moisture. These agronomical practices were significantly superior to control (no agronomical practice). The highest soil accumulation (0.0015 Cum/m2) was recorded by terracing and bunding. Soil accumulation was 0.00075 Cum/m2 when gully was plugged with stone and cement. These two treatments were significantly superior over the treatments of mulching and use of cover crop.
