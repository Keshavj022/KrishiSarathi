Mexican poppy, prickly poppy Argemone mexicana Linn. The seeds are emetic and narcotic. They are reported to be used for diarrhoea and dysentery; but taken in large quantities, they are poisonous. They yield a yellowish brown oil (22-37%), known as Argemone Oil. The oil is nauseous and non-edible. The seeds are externally very similar to those of rape and mustard (Brassica spp.). The seeds and the oil are employed to adulterate those of rape and mustard. The seed-cake can be used as fertilizer. The plant, when eaten by animals, causes diarrhoea and sleepiness. It is used as an insecticide. The aqueous and alcoholic extracts of the plant are reported to have stimulating effect on isolated parts of different animals. The aqueous extract of flowers and leaves possesses weak antibiotic property, whereas that of the bark possesses anti- viral property.
