 Therefore, focus should be on rainfed agro-ecosystem which requires holistic planning, prioritization of resources, operationalization of district contingency plans, etc. Thus comprehensive strategy can help in sustaining/ enhancing production and productivity of pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals in the country apart from rice. Availability of seeds of multiple stress tolerant varieties, supplemental irrigation beside critical inputs will add value to the production scenario. For ensuring the set targets, it is imperative to develop micro-level planning and its implementation at grass root level. To address the issue of malnutrition, ICAR has improved the nutritional quality of more than 70 high yielding varieties of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables and fruits. Special efforts are being made to popularize these bio-fortified varieties among masses. ICAR AGRO-ADVISORY FOR KHARIF-2022 ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 2 Quality seeds of bio-fortified varieties are being produced and made available for commercial cultivation. The bio-fortified varieties of different crops are: Rice (CR Dhan 310, DRR Dhan 45, DRR Dhan 48, DRR Dhan 49, Zinco Rice MS, CR Dhan 311, CR Dhan 315);Wheat (WB 02, HPBW 01, PusaTejas, PusaUjala, HD 3171, HI 8777, MACS 4028, PBW 752, PBW 757, Karan Vandana, DBW 173, UAS 375, DDW 47, PBW 771, HI 8802, HI 8805, HD 3249, MACS 4058, HD 3298, HI 1633, DBW 303, DDW 48);Maize (Vivek QPM 9, Pusa HM4 Improved, Pusa HM8 Improved, Pusa HM9 Improved, Pusa Vivek QPM9 Improved, Pusa VH 27 Improved, Pusa HQPM5 Improved, Pusa HQPM7, Improved, IQMH 201, IQMH 202, IQMH 203);Pearl Millet (HHB 299, AHB 1200Fe, AHB 1269Fe, ABV 04, Phule Mahashakti, RHB 233, RHB 234, HHB 311); Finger Millet (VR 929, CFMV 1, CFMV 2); Little Millet (CLMV 1); Lentil (PusaAgeti Masoor, IPL 220); Groundnut (Girnar 4, Girnar 5); Linseed (TL 99); Mustard (Pusa Mustard 30, Pusa Double Zero Mustard 31, PusaMustar 32); Soybean (NRC 127, NRC 132, NRC 147). To promote and up-scaling the bio-fortified varieties, Extension Division of ICAR has initiated Nutri-sensitive Agricultural Resources and Innovations (NARI) through the vast network of Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) at district level. The ICAR has prepared agro-advisories for farmers for Kharif season across the country covering major crops, livestock, poultry and fisheries. The agro-advisory and its regional translations have been organized for respective states under 11 ATARI (Zones 1 to 11) of the Agricultural Extension Division of ICAR. The crop, livestock and fisheries advisories mainly deal with best practices to be adopted by farmers during ensuing summer period and kharif season. The technical aspects covered in the advisories are related to seed, soil, water, nutrient and health management in crops and livestock enterprises.   Selection of suitable crop cultivars in different crops and adhering to optimum sowing times for achieving higher productivity.
