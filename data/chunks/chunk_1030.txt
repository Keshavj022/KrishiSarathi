 They are medium maturing having more than 3 t/ha of grain yield and 7 t/ha of fodder yield (Table 1). In the current era, improving nutrition in staple crops through genetic biofortification needs focus as self- sufficiency in food quantity is attained. There is a need for premium price for biofortified grains and products in the market. This will enhance market opportunities for farmers and ascertain nutritional security in the Biofortified variety (Dhanashakti) and hybrids (RHB 234, AHB 1269, HHB 311) of pearl millet Indian Farming 32 January 2023 future. Biofortified cultivars being developed through conventional breeding do not face the possible challenge of food regulations and consumer acceptance and can be easily marketed. SUMMARY Combining the yield and micronutrients in pearl millet hybrids has been successful with the collaboration of national and international breeding programmes. As a result, 6 biofortified hybrids has been released at national level since 2018 with comparable grain and fodder yields to commercially grown hybrids. Apart from this, one widely adapted variety, ICTP 8203 is available to the farming community. These biofortified cultivars have comparable yields to commercially grown hybrids and need to be widely cultivated for bringing nutritional security in the marginal areas, where the crop is the sole option of living to the farmers. *Corresponding authorâ€™s e-mail: sanjana@millets.res.in Table 1.
