Hence, the land available in the village may be undertaken on lease or Panchayat land may be made available for decentralized storage of bales. Ultimately, transportation distance is a decisive factor in the economics of biomass pellets based power plants. It was opined by the experts that transportation of bales is quite feasible and economical from a distance of 15 km radius.
