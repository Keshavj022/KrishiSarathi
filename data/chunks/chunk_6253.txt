 The results of treatment of joint, limbs or shoulder swellings observed at MASFU are presented in Tables 5—11. The pain sensation in animals was evaluated by palpation with thumb and index finger at the site of inflammation. On day 0, the pain score was 2.6±0.13 and showed regular undulating trend. On days 7, 14, 21 and 30, it became 1.3+0.15, 0.5±0.25, 0.2 and 0.2 Fig. 2. Subsided swelling after application of ointment respectively, which showed decreasing trend of reduction in pain. The animals of group II treated with iodine ointment revealed pain score 2.5±0.16 on day 0, which declined regularly and linearly (Tables 2 and 5). Iodine ointment is a proven mild counter- irritant and strong antiseptic, having ability to dilate the superficial blood vessels with enhancing phagocytosis, which literally helps dilute and drain the inflammatory fluid through lymphatic and thereby reduce the inflammation of the part. During the phase of drainage of inflammatory fluids, the chemical mediators of inflammation, i.e. cytokinine, bradykinine, alphaprostaglandin Table 3.

When nerve irritability is reduced, the pain is reduced. The medicament consisting oialua, castor oil, sahajan gum and snail shell in a specific proportion was heated before the application. This thick paste on application supplies heat to the affected body parts and helps in augmentation of the blood supply and phagocytosis. Alua acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, whereas castor oil acts as a mild counter-irritant for a longer duration. However, sahajan gum is an antiseptic. The combined action is to reduce the pain and swelling. Swelling over leg and joint Ten clinical cases of swelling over limb Fig. 4.
