 Due to low water holding capacity of the soils, the crops often suffers from moisture scarcity during lean period especially in the upland areas during December to February months. The soils of Tripura are acidic in reaction and medium in organic carbon content. Acidity– induced soil fertility problems coupled with traditionally minimal use of mineral fertilizers are often held responsible for low levels of crop productivity in the state. Tripura is rapidly shifting towards high yielding crop cultivars therefore there is a need for integrated use of plant nutrients to increase and sustain the productivity in future. Productivity of boro rice, which contributes equally to Tripura’s food grain basket like kharif rice, is suffering from low rainfall scenario due to climate change effect. Therefore, boro rice farmers need technologies to cope with water shortage and ways must be sought to grow rice with lesser amount of available water. Crop Production: 1. Lack of location specific improved/sustainable production technologies for major crops 2. Lack of optimum sowing time, planting geometry, and nutrient management practices for major crops 3. Non-availability of suitable cropping sequence and intercropping systems for state 4. Poor market linkages 5. Poor fertility of soil 6. Occurrence of insect-pests and diseases 7. Poor seed germination due to low soil moisture at the time of sowing 8. Intermittent moisture stress during crop growth period 9. Non-availability of quality seed and agricultural chemicals in time 10. Inability to purchase modern agricultural implement 11. Lack of irrigation facilities 12. Non-availability of labour during peak period 13. Non-availability of timely credit facilities 551 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 14. Low market price 15. Unavailability of manure and bio-fertilizer in required quantity at reasonable price. 16. Lack of soil and water testing facility to the amount and type of bio-fertilizer to be used 17. Lack of adequate knowledge about the use of different pesticides, insecticides 18. Lack of farm mechanization 19.
