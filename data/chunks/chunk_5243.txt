 The second matrix was prepared for different uses of the two indigenous food materials. The data are presented in Table2. The results show that sanai flower had more use than kudrum in terms of its use as vegetable or fuel and medicine. The third matrix was prepared for different characteristics of the two food materials. Data given in Table 3 reveal that both the food materials Fig. 1.

The two food materials , i.e. vegetable of fresh flower of sanai (T1) and vegetable of dry flower of sanai (T2), were cooked and were tested organoleptically (sensory method) by a panel of 10 judges selected from the villagers as well as Table 3.

The data in Table 4 show that vegetable of fresh flower was found to be most popular dietary preparation in terms of taste and was rated very Laboratory studies Laboratory analysis for estimation of the chemical composition of sanai flower was done. Results are presented in Table 5. (Laboratory analysis was done at Department of Animal Nutrition, Ranchi Veterinary College, Ranchi) CONCLUSION Vegetable of fresh flower of sanai was organoleptically highly acceptable than vegetable of dry flowers of sanai. high (9). Flavour or aroma and colour of vegetable of fresh flower were found to be liked very much (7). All the organoleptic scores assigned to vegetable of dry flower were in the category of moderately liked (6). However scores for overall acceptability of vegetable of fresh flower was much higher (7.3) than those of vegetable of dry flower (6.0). Table 5.
