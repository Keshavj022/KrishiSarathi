 The Mann-Kendall test in R software (CRAN repository) was used to perform trend analysis for NVSWI (December- March from 2001-02 to 2019-20) and groundwater level (January-April from 2002 to 2020). Besides, a simple non-parametric approach i.e., statistics of slope proposed by Sen (1968) was also used to assess the magnitude of trend in the sample of N pairs of data. Details about the Mann Kendall Test (Kendall, 1975; Mann, 1945; Wang et al., 2013; Ribeiro et al., 2015; Baig et al., 2022) and Sen’s slope estimator are already well established in literature (Gocic and Trajkovic, 2013; He and Gautam, 2016). The study area was divided into 3 zones each for Punjab and Haryana, (as groundwater use for irrigation in Punjab and Haryana is differently controlled) and the mean NVSWI and mean groundwater level were used for the trend analysis in the ACZs of each state. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Rainfall characteristics in the study area The maximum annual rainfall in ACZ I, ACZ II and ACZ III was recorded in the years 2004–05, 2019–20 and 2006–07, respectively. The long term (1986–2020) average annual rainfall (December-March) in the area under investigation was 40.7 mm, 67.01 mm and 130.4 mm in ACZ I, ACZ II and ACZ III respectively. Also, the difference in the mean values of rainfall between ACZ I and II, ACZ II and III and ACZ I and III was 26.4 mm, 63.3 mm and 89.8 mm, respectively. 3.2. Drought events, frequency and intensity Run theory was used to identify and analyze the drought duration (DD), drought severity (DS), and drought intensity (DI) based on SPI-12 in all 3 ACZs of the study area. The longest duration of drought wit­ nessed by the ACZ I was 45 months during the drought event 4 (1999–2003) [Fig. 2(a)], followed by drought event-1 with a 13-month duration. Drought event 4 was more severe than drought event-1, but the DI of drought event-1 was higher [Fig. 2(b)]. ACZ II experienced the longest and most severe drought (46 months) during the drought event- 3 (1999–2003), followed by 1987–88 (12 days) [Fig. 2(c)], but the DI of event-1 was higher than that of event-3 [Fig. 2(d)]. ACZ III endured the maximum number of drought events (6), the longest and most severe was during 2004–2007, followed by 2001–2003 and 2016–2018 [Fig. 2 (e)]. Although, this zone suffered the maximum number of drought events, the DI was < 1.0 for most of the events except the drought events 1 (1987–88) and 6 (2016–18), which indicated the DI > 1.0 [Fig. 2(f)]. As a result, increased drought occurrences in ACZ I and II might have an influence on crop yields due to decreased rainfall and climate variability. 3.2.1. Spatio-temporal dynamics of SPI-12 Specifically, the shorter time scales of SPI values (1, 3, and 6) adequately depicts early warning of meteorological drought, as well as interim soil moisture and agricultural deficits (Svoboda et al., 2012).
