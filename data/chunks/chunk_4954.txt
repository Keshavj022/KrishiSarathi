 Pebble also appears as a potential mulch material, as it is also locally available in plenty. However, it may interfere with cultural practices like fertilizer application etc. Moisture content in 0_60 cm soil layer under different mulch treatments is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9.

Water harvesting Five dug-out tanks were constructed in the experimental area. Four of these were lined each with silpaulin (Fig. 10), bitumen (Fig. 11), mud (mixed with dry grass in the ratio of 10:1), and cement+concrete layer (RCC) (Fig. 12), and the fifth was kept as unlined control (Fig. 13). The capacity of silpaulin tank was 17.6 m3, bitumen tank was 10.0 m3, RCC tank was 8.2 m3, mud-plastered tank was 9.8 m3, and the control was 12.7 m3. Before spreading the silpauline sheet in the dug-out tank, the tank walls were smoothened to avoid puncturing of sheet. Molten bitumen was sprayed on the walls with the help of a metal container having numerous small holes in the side wall. For mud plastering, dry, chopped grass was mixed with dry soil in the ratio of 1:10. The mixture was saturated with water, and kneaded thoroughly to convert it into a soft plastic mud. No seepage was observed in the RCC and polylined tanks. The bitumen-lined tank did not perform well at this site, because the soil at the experimental site was loose and gravelly. It caved in along with the bitumen layer as the temperature rose and the soil became dry. The mud-lining also did not prove effective, as it developed numerous cracks upon drying. It was also not possible to store water at all in the unlined control tanks due to very high seepage losses. Hence in this type of soil, the chaal concept does not seem to work. The chaal has to be lined with some effective sealant like RCC or polyethylene. For bitumen, the mode of application has to be changed under such type of conditions. Probably a mixture of bitumen emulsion and concrete, instead of spraying of bitumen emulsion alone, would be a better choice. The cost of construction of dug-out tanks is given in Table 5. The cost was highest for RCC tank, followed by polylining and bitumen lining. Although the cost involved in the construction of mud-plastered and unlined tanks was minimum, their utility would depend on the seepage losses and hence the effective water storage.
