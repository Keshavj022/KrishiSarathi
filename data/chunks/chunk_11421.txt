Foliar application of 0.5% diammonium phosphate and zinc sulphate in combination at weekly intervals for two months reduces the bronzing in guava. Pre-flowering sprays 0.4% boric acid, 0.3% ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 163 zinc sulphate and copper sulphate 0.2-0.4% increase the yield and fruit size. Plants start bearing at 2-3 years of age, but they attain full bearing after 10 years with100 to 150 kg. fruits every year. Harvesting periods is August for rainy season crop and November- December for winter season crop. The shelf life can be extended up to 20 days by keeping them at low temperature of 50 C and 75- 85% relative humidity. Spices Garlic It can be cultivated on various soil types.

The manure and fertilizers requirement are 125 kg N, 65 kg P and 100kg K/ha and 40 tonnes FYM. Borax up to 10 kg/ ha increase bulb size and yield. Thrips: If it is not controlled properly, can cause yield loss up to 50%. Mostly observed in dry weather. If infestation observed in field spray Fipronil@30 ml/15 lt water or Profenophos@10 ml or Carbosulfan@10 ml+ Mancozeb@25 gm/10 lt water by 8-10 days interval. Purple blotch: Severe infestation may cause yield loss up to 70%. Deep purple lesions are observed on leaves. Yellow streaks get turn brown and extend along the blade.
