 Due to the complementary time and space of the component crops, intercropping systems have a yield advantage over systems using only sugarcane. It is essential to increase system productivity in order to fulfil the rising demand for different crops, and increase the viability of the sugarcane production system. Sugarcane + French bean (1:2) intercropping system gave the higher cane equivalent yield (106.0 t/ha), net returns (`1,87400/ha) and benefit: cost ratio (2.33). The least profitable option was sugarcane alone. Hence, intercropping system (sugarcane + French bean) was adjudged the most productive and profitable, which deserves adoption by farmers of sub-tropical Indian conditions. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: navnit.sri@rpcau.ac.in Table 1.

NEPZ is the second largest wheat producing zone in India where wheat is subjected to the terminal heat stress due to late sowing after harvesting of long duration rice crop. The new variety DBW 316 is tolerant to various diseases such as wheat rusts, wheat blast and foliar blight, and has high heat tolerance (HSI 0.19) and drought tolerance (DSI 0.88) level. It has recorded a potential yield level of 68 q/ha under late sown conditions of NEPZ. DBW 316 is rich in zinc and contains high grain protein (13.
