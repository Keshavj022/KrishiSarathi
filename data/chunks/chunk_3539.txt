 Judicious pruning of tree canopy helps in penetration of sunlight in the lower portion of the canopy, and orchard soil and facilitates circulation of air deep inside the orchard which ultimately reduces the formation of humid microclimate inside the canopy. Reduction in the severity of pests and diseases can eventually lead to reduction in the cost of cultivation and thus improve the socio-economic status of the orchardists. Application of mobile app like ‘ Canopy Capture’ is very helpful in pruning operations to maintain desired canopy cover. Some studies on the effect of canopy management on population dynamics of mango pests have been conducted by some investigators using various canopy measuring equipment which is time taking, needs operational skills and not practicable to implement in the farmers field. Using of mobile app for the estimation March–April 2024 15 Name of disease and pest Procedure for observation Mango mealy bugs Counting number of mealy bugs infested shoots from each direction of the selected trees counted during season of infestation. Mango leaf hoppers Number of nymphs and adults were visually counted (by using photographs) on a single leaf from each direction of the selected trees. Shoot gall psylla Number of infested terminal shoots out of five shoots from each of the four directions of the selected tree. Sooty mould Infestation was recorded using following disease scoring scale. 0 : No infection on leaves 1 : 1 to 10% of leaf area covered 2 : 11 to 25% of leaf area covered 3 : 26 to 50% of leaf area covered 4 : > 50% of leaf area covered Mango malformation Count all the malformed shoots/twigs in a tree and record. Observations Table 1. Effect of canopy cover on the incidence of major diseases and pests in mango orchards Incidence of pests (recorded in the month of March) Canopy Percent Control, No pruning Above 80% Pruned to obtain 76-80% canopy cover % reduction over control Pruned to obtain 70-75% canopy cover % reduction over control Mango mealy bug 4.30 2.40 44.2% 0.75 82.6% Mango leaf hoppers 71.75 10.60 85.2% 2.95 95.9% Shoot gall psylla 3.10 1.05 66.1% 0.55 82.2% Sooty mould 3.75 1.15 69.3% 0.95 74.7% Mango malformation 13.05 3.35 74.3% 2.95 77.4% *Significant reduction in pest and disease population under different pruning intensities is also due to the removal of infected portion of tree biomass. Table 2. Effect of different percentage of canopy cover on fruit yield of mango Yield attribute Canopy Percent Control No pruning Above 80% Pruned to obtain 76-80% canopy cover Percent increase or decrease over control Pruned to obtain 70-75% canopy cover Percent increase or decrease over control Yield (Kg/tree) 83.4 104.0 + 24.7 88.6 + 3.8 Number of fruits/tree 182.8 231.8 + 26.8 219.2 + 19.9 Average fruit weight (g) 404 449 + 11.1 456 + 12.9 A well ventilated orchard with optimum canopy cover Profuse flowering in Mango cv. Mallika, under optimum canopy cover of canopy cover makes estimation of canopy very easy.
