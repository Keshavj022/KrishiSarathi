 In lemongrass (Cymbopogon flexuosus), NLG 48 was found the best in terms of herbage yield, oil content and oil yield/ha at Faizabad. Whereas at Hisar, H1 7 showed highest herb yield; HL 11 highest oil content and HL 2 highest citral percentage. At Indore, CBI 3 and MCB 412 were found promising in safed musli. At Mandsaur, MCB 405 (for fresh root yield and steroid content) and MCB 409 (dry roots/plant) were found promising. MCB 405 was also found superior at Udaipur for fresh root yield. At Akola, significantly highest root yield was recorded due to application of 5 tonnes/ha vermicompost in 30 cm × 10 cm spacing. At Udaipur, increasing plant density from 1.66 to 3.33 lakh/ha significantly increased root yield. A new leaf spot disease was noticed. The causal fungus was identified as Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid (IMI number 387291). In satavari (Asparagus racemosus), highest dry fleshy root yield/plant was recorded in HAR 8 at Hisar. In isabgol (Plantago ovata), DM 1 was found highly resistant at Anand. Entry J.I. 80 gave highest yield with 23.67% over the existing variety. About 25 and 50 kg N/ha and 2 irrigation levels (25 and 75 days) were found to be best for isabgol at Hisar. At Udaipur, delay in sowing from 10 November during 2000–01 and from 20 November during 2001–02 resulted in significant decrease of various yield attributes, seed and husk yield of isabgol. At Mandasur, J.A 16, MOP 278 and MOP 541 were high latex yielders. At Udaipur, Chetak Aphim proved its superiority over other varieties. Maximum yield of latex, seed and husk were also recorded in sowing done on 30 October. Morphine content gradually increased in petals collected on first day (0.46%), second day (0.55%), third day (0.64%) and fourth day (0.82%) of opening probably due to increased mobility of morphine due to certain metabolic activities. But it decreased in petals collected on the day of falling from the flower either fourth day or fifth day of opening (0.62%). In long pepper (Piper longum), the effect of organic and inorganic source combinations showed that treatments significantly affected dry spike yield in Viswam and Anand types. Significant difference was noticed between treatments on rhizome yield in Kacholam (Kaempferia galanga) with the application of organic and inorganic source combinations. At Solan, application of NPK at 90 : 60 : 60 kg/ha and harvesting 270 and 60 days after OIL-YIELDING PLANTS The Glycyrrhizic acid content in liquorice increased with increasing age at Hisar. Its maximum content was recorded after 2 years of plant growth. In Japanese mint, 2 years data revealed that Gomti and Himalayan were the best varieties yielding the maximum oil yield at Hisar. Deltametharin (1.0 ml/litre) was found to be effective in controlling Helicoverpa armigera and Plusia orichalcea pest and increased the yield at Solan. l Safed musli CBI 3 and MCB 412 were promising. l Isabgol DM 1 was highly resistant to diseases.
