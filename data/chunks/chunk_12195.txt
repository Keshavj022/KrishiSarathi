Plot size, spacing and number of replications Trial Plot size No. of rows/plot Spacing Replications IVT and AVTs 2.25 m × 3.0 m 10 22.5 cm × 10 cm 3 6. Agroclimatic zones Agroclimatic zones are not demarcated for small millets. Varieties are identified at the national level for more than a state after considering varietal performance in individual states. 7. Description of morphological features Minimum traits required for distinctness, uniformity and stability of a variety may be decided in the workshop (Annexure-IV). 8. Others Information on available DNA markers (based on the availability) is required to be recorded. Pulses (Pigeonpea, Chickpea, Mungbean, Urdbean, Fieldpea, Lentil, Rajmash) 1.
