 Space requirement shall depend upon the manner in which the dry fodder is stored. An adult cow consumes about 4-5 kg of dry fodder per day while young stock consumes about 2-3 kg (depending on age and body size) per day. Annual requirement of hay/straw needed can be worked out on the basis of number of days in a year when hay/straw is used. The size of shed needed to store this hay or straw can be calculated by referring to the Table 6 above. Land required i) Land required for setting up of gaushalas The estimated total land required for setting up of gaushala premises including land required for housing of all animals, store, chaff cutter, milking parlour, sick animal unit, veterinary dispensary, manure storage etc. for different sizes of gaushalas is given in below. 7 MANUAL ON MANAGEMENT OF GAUSHALAS ii) Land required for fodder cultivation The land required for the cultivation of fodder depends on the climate, soil type, fertility and the availability and quality of irrigation water. On an average 4 to 5 cows animals along with their followers can be maintained on an acre of well fertile agricultural land with assured irrigation facilities. The Gaushala may be maintaining primarily indigenous cows and cows which may not be high milk producers. In this case one acre of land will be sufficient for producing enough fodder for 6-7 cows and their calves. Accordingly the land required for fodder cultivation for different categories of Gaushala is estimated as under: Land required for setting up of gaushalas and fodder cultivation Size of gaushala Approximate land required for gaushala premises (in acres) Approximate land required for fodder cultivation (in acres) 100 cows 1.0 15 500 cows 4.50 75 1000 cows 7.5 150 Machinery and equipments required Item Size of gaushala 100 cows 500 cows 1,000 cows Animal ambulance 1 2 2 Tractor (35 HP) with trailer 1 1 2 High capacity chaff /fodder cutters 1 1 2 Bucket milking machine 5 10 20 Utility vehicle 1 1 2 Electricity generator set (20 KVA) 1 -- - Electricity generator set (40 KVA) -- 1 1 Milk cans with mushroom lid (40 lt capacity) 10 10 10 Contd... 8 MANUAL ON MANAGEMENT OF GAUSHALAS Item Size of gaushala 100 cows 500 cows 1,000 cows Bulk milk chiller - - 1 Milking buckets, stainless steel, round and narrow mouthed (10 lt. capacity) 20 50 20 M.S wheel barrows 2 5 8 Tractor operated dung/slurry scraper -- 1 2 Personal computer with accessories -- 1 2 Table continued 9 Animal identification Identification of all animals is necessary for maintaining animal records. It also helps in routine management of the animals. All animals brought from outside into the Gaushala or newly borne calves at the Gaushala itself have to be given a number by which it could be identified. The identification of newly borne calves should be done by tattooing in the ear.
