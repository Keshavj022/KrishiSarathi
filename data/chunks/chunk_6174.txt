 Results of the study also indicate that enhancement of early sprouting is due to nutrients, organic matter content of cowdung as well as effect of bacteria and actinomycetes present in the cowdung. The micro flora present in the cowdung and inoculation with three bacteria strains and one actinomycete isolated from cowdung reduced the phenol content in the tuber that is toxic for sprouting and helps in enhancing it. However, sprouting is inversely related to phenol content. Further, in the treated tubers the protein content was high, resulting to increased enzymatic activity in tubers during germination process. One bacterium strain of Bacillus subtilis (S104) found to induce early sprouting as well 100% sprouting than other treatment. The additional nutrient in the cowdung accelerated the Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Table 6.

Thus it helps in maintaining moisture status in the tuber required for sprouting. In addition, Bacillus subtilis strain and actinomycetes have the property of controlling disease and fungal pathogens. They reduce the disease incidence during sprouting the antagonistic effect of three Bacillus subtilis strains, as actinomycetes strain against four fungal diseases, viz., Sclerotium rolfisii, Botryodiplodia theobromae,. Fusarium sp. and Rhizopus sp. was confirmed by in-vitro study. Organism-2 Organism-3 Contents HORTICULTURAL CROPS Code Title of the ITK Description of the ITK Name and address of the discloser Location of the use of the ITK Experimenters : 403 : Off-season flowering in guava : The farmers bend down the branches of guava about 45 to 60 days before flowering in 3 to 8 years old plants. The branches are bent towards outer periphery to open the centre and allow penetration of sunlight. After 25 to 30 days, new shoots emerge from the bent portion, which bear profuse flowers. This practice results in 39% increase in flowering in early summer and 28% increase in late autumn. Off- season flowering fetches Rs 590 to Rs 600/plant, instead of Rs 150 to Rs 180/plant in the normal season.
