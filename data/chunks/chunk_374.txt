 • Youth engagement: NE India boasts a substantial youth population, exceeding 20 lakhs, within the age group of 15-35 years. By introducing contemporary cage culture techniques and technologies, the region can involve its youth in entrepreneurial endeavours, thereby lessening the inclination towards migration in pursuit of livelihood opportunities. Environmental scope and opportunities • Resource optimization: NE India is endowed with abundant water bodies, comprising 16.91% of India’s rivers/canals, 0.15% of small reservoirs, 0.69% of medium and large reservoirs, 1.63% of ponds and tanks, 38.16% of beels/oxbow lakes/ derelict water, and 55.09% of water bodies other than rivers and canals. The adoption of CBCC holds the potential to optimize the utilization of these resources, thereby enhancing overall resource efficiency. • Pressure reduction on wild stocks: Overfishing is a concern in the region. By adopting cage culture, pressure on wild fish stocks can be alleviated, contributing to the conservation of aquatic biodiversity. • Adaptation to increased flood incidences: In recent years, NE India has experienced an alarming increase in the frequency and intensity of flood incidents, to the tune of 25%, particularly in Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, parts of Meghalaya, and Nagaland. These floods are affecting half a million people every year. Often triggered by heavy rainfall and the complex topography of the region, these floods have posed significant challenges to local communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure. In this situation, embracing innovative strategies like CBCC offers a beacon of hope as an adaptive measure. Challenges and mitigation strategies • Environmental sustainability: Mismanaged cage culture can result in water pollution, habitat degradation, and disease outbreaks. To counter this, enforceable guidelines encompassing cage placement, stocking density, and water quality management are crucial. A well-defined regulatory structure is essential for responsible and sustainable community cage culture. Collaboration among government bodies, local communities, and experts is vital for comprehensive guideline development. • Climate vulnerability: Climate- induced occurrences like flooding pose a threat to cage infrastructure, causing damage and disruption. • Disease management: Disease outbreaks can devastate fish Indian Farming 41 December 2023 stocks and livelihoods. Disease risks can be reduced through the implementation of biosecurity measures, robust quarantine procedures, and enhanced disease surveillance. • Financial access: Overcoming the initial investment hurdle is challenging for communities and entrepreneurs. Government subsidies, microfinance initiatives, and developmental agency support play a pivotal role in facilitating financial access for cage culture development. Experience gained from CBCC A pilot-scale CBCC was demonstrated in 2021 at the Dumbur Reservoir in Tripura, involving local tribal farmers.
