98, respectively, and the sequential model (normal vs. subclinical) to the tune of 0.98 and 0.95. The testing accuracy for the DL-CNN sequential models was 0.96 in Murrah buffaloes. Similarly, the training and validation accuracy of the sequential model (normal vs. clinical) via the augmented dataset in Sahiwal cows reflected a Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report in dairy animals by image processing algorithm, thereby enhancing accessibility and usability of the technology for farmers at all scales. The study was conducted at the Livestock Research Centre (LRC), ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana. Karnal is located at latitude 290 43“ N and longitude 770 2” E, with an elevation (attitude) of 250 m above sea level. The region has a sub-tropical climate; hence, the minimum and the maximum temperatures often range from 4 °C (winter) to 45 °C (summer). The annual rainfall of Karnal is around 70 cm with a vapour pressure of 7 to 25 mmHg. Seasons were classified as winter (December to March), summer (April to June), rainy (July-August) and autumn (September to November). The dry and wet bulb thermometer readings will be recorded regularly at the respective milking parlour of each breed. The temperature-humidity index was calculated using “THI= 0.72(Tdb + Twb) + 40.6, where Tdb = Dry bulb temperature in °C and Twb= Wet bulb temperature in °C" (McDowell, 1972). The month-wise analysis of the udder thermograms (USST) of experimental Sahiwal cows revealed a significant difference (p < 0.01) between the mean values of USST of SCM and CM-affected quarters compared to healthy quarters. During January, the mean values of USST showed an increase of 1.82 and 3.11 °C among SCM and CM-affected quarters compared to healthy quarters, respectively. Similarly, during February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December, the mean values of USST showed an increase of 1.37 and 2.35 °C, 0.96 and 2.09 °C, 0.79 and 1.66 °C, 1.21 and 2.21 °C, 0.76 and 1.34 °C, 1.04 and 1.78 °C, 0.73 and 1.49 °C, 1.71 and 2.70 °C, 1.01 and 2.06 °C, 1.27 and 2.47 °C,1.81 and 2.76 °C, among SCM and CM affected quarters compared to healthy quarters, respectively. Compared to healthy quarters, the highest increment in USST was observed during January in the SCM and CM-affected quarters. The lowest increment in temperature was observed during August for SCM compared to healthy quarters and June for CM compared to healthy quarters. Within the USST of healthy quarters of Sahiwal cows, the mean values were significant (p < 0.01) between the months except for October— November and August—April, and their mean values were comparable among themselves but showed a significant difference (p < 0.01) from the mean values of other months. In the case of USST of SCM quarters, the mean values differed significantly (p < 0.
