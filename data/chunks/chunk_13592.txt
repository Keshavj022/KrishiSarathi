 The above ﬁndings suggest varietal substitution away from PBW-502 and toward HD-2967. To gain further insights, Table 2 compares the yield, revenue, operational costs, and proﬁts associated with HD-2967, PBW- 502, and PBW-343.14 The evidence shows that farmers using the HD-2967 wheat variety, compared to PBW-343, experienced higher yields (14 %, column 5/column 3), higher revenues (13 %), higher operational costs (5 %), and greater proﬁts (about INR 6,320 per hec- tare). Adopters of HD-2967 had about 3.7 quintals per hectare more yield (10 % higher) than farmers using the PBW-502 wheat variety. Table 1 Proﬁle of wheat farmers, Uttar Pradesh, 2017–18.

Note: Standard deviations are in parentheses. Below-poverty-line (BPL) cards are issued to poorer households. The asset index is constructed by applying principal component analysis using the ownership of 22 assets (e.g., tractor, two-wheeler, four-wheeler, etc.). Kisan Credit Cards provide institutional credit to farmers through short-term credit facilities for cultivation activities. Soil health cards are issued to farmers and provide information on nutrient requirements based on soil analysis. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana provides insurance for crops. KVK villages are those where KVKs have conducted interventions such as FLDs. Non-KVK villages are those where KVKs have not conducted any type of intervention. Land, asset index, and HH experience have been winsorized at the bottom and top percentile.
