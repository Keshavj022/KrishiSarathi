89) @ 2 ml/litre starting from the initiation of the disease and two subsequent sprays at 15 days interval for effective and economical management of powdery mildew of ber by the SK Nagar centre of Gujarat. Management of fig rust disease: The farmers are advised to give three sprays of either Carbendazim 50% WP (0.1%) (ICBR 1: 20.73) @ 3.3 g/litre or Tebuconazole 25.9EC (0.1%) (ICBR 1:8.77) @ 3.86 ml/litre Crop Management icar annual report 2022-23 108 Vegetable crops Biopesticides and insecticides for management of sucking pests complex in brinjal: Spraying of Azadirachtin 300 ppm @ 5 ml/L in combination with Lecanicillium lecanii @ 2.5 g/L was found effective with 71.26, 52.58, 53.30 and 55.49% reduction in sucking pests population, viz. mites, whiteflies, aphids and leaf- hoppers, respectively and 28.16% increase in marketable yield with C:B ratio 1:4.23. Integrated pest management (IPM) module in bitter gourd: IPM comprised seed treatment with imidacloprid, installation of yellow sticky traps, border crop with maize, spraying of Azadirachtin, thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, cyantraniliprole, Neem oil + Lecanicillium lecanii and neem oil + Beauveria bassiana from 20 DAS onwards to till 70 DAS at 10 days intervals each harboured lowest whiteflies population with maximum of 70.14% reduction over control (PROC). The number of predatory ladybird beetles and polyphagous spiders were also higher in this module. Furthermore, the highest healthy fruit yields were recorded from the integrated pest management module accompanied with maximum highest cost benefit ratio of 1:5. Under AICRP (VC), treatment comprising of mulching, sequential spray of pyriproxyfen (5% EC) + fenpropathrin (15% EC), spiromesifen (22.9% SC), buprofezin (25% SC) and neem oil @ 10 days interval, recorded least average percent disease incidence (24.44%) against control (71.85%). Additionally, the same treatment recorded the highest average yield of 155.41q/ha over control (77.91q/ha). Also, the same treatment showed the highest C:B ratio of 1:1.95. Hence it can be recommended for the management of viral diseases in okra (Kashi Pragati) under Varanasi region. Tuber crops Management of plant parasitic nematodes in tapioca: Management of plant parasitic nematodes with the use of Trichoderma harzianum and Pochonia chlamydosporia enriched neem cake and organic manures and crop rotation with least preferred host plants like tapioca were demonstrated in the farmers’ fields of Alappuzha district in Kerala. Cassava stem and root-rot: The major pathogen associated with stem and root-rot of cassava in Kerala was identified as Fusarium falciforme. In the farmer’s field, Carbendazim (0.05%) and Propineb (0.1%) showed highest reduction (100%) of the disease followed by a cassava biopesticide Nanma (0.7%), (88%), Trichoderma asperellum (75%). The cassava mosaic resistant var. SreeReksha released by ICAR-CTCRI did not exhibit any stem and root-rot symptom during 2021-2022.
