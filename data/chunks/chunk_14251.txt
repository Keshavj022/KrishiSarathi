 However, in recent years, the supply–demand ratio frequently touches the threshold value of 1 and it will be interesting to see how the metric will change when the conditions change. Yield ratio is closer to 1 most of the time. Two climate related stressors (aridity index and climate variability) were chosen for stress testing. The aridity index, which is defined as the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration, was selected as one of the climate related stressors to consider changes in both climate variables, namely precipitation and temperature, together for stress testing. In addition, climate variability, represented by the coefficient of variation of precipitation, was considered as the second stressor as we are planning for adaptation in the agricultural sector.

Climate Services 30 (2023) 100358 13 4.2. Hydrologic and crop modeling The ArcSWAT model was calibrated and validated for both discharge and crop yield. Discharge calibration was done at all four stream gauge locations, but crop yield was only calibrated at sub-basin 14 to represent rice yield in the Erode district. The SWAT model was implemented for a 30-year period from 1991 to 2015, with a 5-year warm-up period. Calibration was performed from 1996 to 2005, and validation was performed from 2006 to 2015. The model performance was evaluated using r2 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency parameters. Fig. 10a representing the calibration and validation plots at four locations, shows that the model performs well during both calibration and validation periods, at all locations (Moriasi et al., 2007). The scatter plots of observed and simulated flows (Fig. 10b) show a good agreement for low flows, but for high flows, the model mostly overpredicts the flow. At S4 location near to the basin outlet, the model prediction deviates more from the observed flows during the validation period. Table 6 lists the sensitive parameters at the four locations.
