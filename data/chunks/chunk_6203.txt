Peach leaves paste b. Peach leaves paste (n=10) (n=10) Depending upon clinical recovery, period of medication varied from 14 to 21 days in animals and even within a group. All the affected wounds were evaluated on days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14 and 21 or till healing occurred on the basis of parameter given below. Exudation: Type of exudates was scored and graded as 0= dry casts; 1= serious; 2= fibrinous; 3= seropurulent and 4= purulent. Quantity of exudate: Quantity of exudates was scored as 0= none (apparently dry wound); 1 = slight (wound is moist but not oozing on pressing); 2= moderate (wound is moist and slightly oozing on pressing); and 3= extreme (exudate is visible and pressure leads to excessive exudation). Peripheral swelling: Peripheral swelling was recorded at weekly intervals as- 0= nil; 1 = moderate and 2= marked. Warmth and pain: Warmth around the affected area was compared with that of the normal area of touching with palm. This was done by the same person at 10.30 a.m. The warmth was graded as per order: 1= normal warmth; 2= mildly warmth; 3= moderately warmth and 4= hot. Pain on manipulation: The pain of the affected area was recorded as: 0=no pain on extensive mani-pulation; 1= pain on extensive manipulation; 2= pain on moderate manipulation, and 3= pain on slight manipulation. Colour of wound: It grossly depicts the status of healing and was scored as: 1= pale yellow; 2= pale red and 3= Pink. Area of wound: Area of wound was recorded at 7 days intervals. Margins of wound, area of granulation and area of epithelization were marked and the percentage of healing was calculated. Finally time taken for complete healing was recorded. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Therapeutic trial: Total 23 maggot wounds (17 bovine and 6 canine) were treated at IVRI with the paste of peach (Prunus persica) leaves. In bovines 8 cases recovered by day 7 and 6 recovered on day 14. The remaining 3 cases of maggot wounds required 28 days (4 weeks) for Table 1.

It was noticed that the recovery period was longer when the site of wound was such that bandage could not be applied. In canine 3 cases recovered on day 7 but the remaining 3 recovered on day 14.
