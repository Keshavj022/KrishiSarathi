 Blueberry: A convolutional neural network (CNN)- based image recognition method has been developed to identify the presence of trays containing living legacy blueberry plants, trays without living plants, and the absence of trays in the rooting stage, achieving high accuracy with trained models. Additionally, two deep learning models, ResNet and ResNeXt, have demonstrated superior performance over traditional machine learning methods in classifying fruit samples. This indicates their potential for online fruit sorting and highlights the effectiveness of deep CNNs in analyzing internal mechanical damage. Furthermore, fully convolutional networks were employed for hyperspectral image segmentation, with models trained without transfer learning outperforming those that utilized it, accurately predicting early bruising in blueberries. Cucumber: Cucumbers are characterized by their high water content, low calorie count, and rich nutritional profile, making them versatile horticultural produce widely used in culinary applications. A robust cucumber recognition algorithm has been proposed, utilizing I-RELIEF for feature analysis and a multi- path convolutional neural network (MPCNN) for feature extraction, along with a block-based strategy to enhance efficiency. This algorithm aims to enable automatic cucumber recognition for natural robot harvesting. Additionally, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) has been employed to identify four cucumber diseases based on symptom images, achieving commendable recognition results with field-captured disease images. The use of dilated convolutional kernels has increased the local receptive field and improved November–December 2024 57 feature extraction, while a global pooling layer has reduced training parameters and mitigated overfitting, leading to enhanced recognition accuracy and robustness. Potato: Machine vision and image processing methods are critical for identifying defects in agricultural products, particularly in potatoes. A potato disease classification algorithm has been developed that employs deep learning and computer vision techniques to identify and classify plant diseases. This algorithm utilizes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify tubers into five categories: four disease classes and one healthy potato class. CNN methods were successfully applied to classify five potato diseases—Healthy, black scurf, common scab, black leg, and pink rot—using a database of 5,000 potato images, achieving accuracies of 100 and 99% in certain classes. Tomato: A deep learning-based method for ripe tomato detection has been proposed, effectively distinguishing between targets and overlapping tomatoes to identify individual fruits. An improved method for tomato organ detection employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify key organs in tomatoes using deep migration learning in complex backgrounds.
