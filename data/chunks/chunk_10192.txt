 During colonial era, scientific developments like breeding, artificial insemination, food processing, record-keeping etc. started but these were mostly restricted to the Government farms and institutes. The common people were able to gain direct benefits from these advancements to a limited extent. Wide-spread poverty and low productivity of animals were the immediate challenges at the time of independence. India which is now the top milk producing country was suffering due to milk shortage in 1947; presents the complete picture of that period. Despite all this, developments like beginning of formal veterinary education, establishment of research institutes and initiation of dairy cooperative movement laid the foundation for the progress achieved in the post-independence era.
