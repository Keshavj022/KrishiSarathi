Report on the Finance and Audit, Budget and Procurement System Reforms: National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM) had revised the report after a follow up of the meeting held on 29 April, 2001. The revised report was again discussed in a meeting held on 25 October, 2002 under the Chairmanship of Additional Secretary, DARE and Financial Adviser DARE wherein an officer of NIFM also participated. During the course of deliberations it was emerged that the revision in the report was however, only marginal and fell quite short of expectations. It was pointed out that the revision did not re-structure the report as desired, so as to make it specific to activities relating to items of expenditure. After considerable deliberations, it was agreed that the NIFM would further revise the report to incorporate the Sub-Sections/Sections as suggested in the meeting. It was also agreed that once the NIFM had brought out the Report as indicated above, the ICAR officials would visit the NIFM for updating/making further correction of the Report. Training: Keeping in view the importance of the Human Resource Development, various training programmes were conducted in various training institutions of repute for 18 officials from Scientific, Technical, Administrative and Finance categories during the reported period.
