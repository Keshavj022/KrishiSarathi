 The treatment can also significantly advance the harvest by 25 days (Gujarat) to 41 days (West Bengal). Improved training system for higher productivity in guava: A modified training system of guava on Espalier architecture comprising training on five-tier wires fixed at 50–60 cm vertical interval on the iron angles or cement poles planted at 1.5 m × 3 m (row × plant) accommodated 2,222 trees/ha. Orientation of 8– 10 branches on four to five wire tiers for emergence of fruiting shoots was achieved, which altered the apical dominance and favoured better fruiting with 35 to 40 fruits weighing 7 to 8 kg/tree (after one year with 14.89 t/ha potential productivity) as compared to 3–4 kg/ tree in traditional system. The potential productivity in third year was 23–25 t/ha. Bearing in one year old guava on Espalier training system High density planting in citrus: High density (800 plants/ha at 5 m × 2.5 m spacing) and ultra-high density (1,600 plants/ha at 2.5 m × 2.5 m spacing) orchards of acid lime cv. Pramalini produced 12.87 t to 17.81 t/ha as against 6.62 t/ha in conventional planting (400 plants/ha at 5 m × 5 m spacing). Similarly, Nagpur mandarin on Rangpur lime rootstock grown under high density (555 plants/ha at 6 m × 3 m spacing) produced 19.46 t/ha as against 6.94 t/ha under conventional (277 plant/ha at 6 m × 6 m spacing). High density planting in cashew: Technology on high density (5 m × 5 m) and ultra high (1,600 plants/ha) Ultra-high density planting in cashew CROP MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 69 density (2.5 m × 2.5 m) planting with 12.12 and 24.32 q/ ha nut yield at four years after planting, respectively, as compared to normal (7.5 m × 7.5 m) planting density (7.23 q/ha) in Hybrid-130 has been standardized and field demonstrated. Root-stock for new grape varieties: Dogridge was identified as the best root-stock for Fantasy Seedless variety with higher berry diameter (18.34 mm) and yield (10.5 kg/vine). Similarly, Dogridge was identified to be best rootstock for Red Globe variety too with higher berry diameter (22.9 mm), bunch weight (580 g) and yield (18.40 kg/vine). Plastic cover and anti-hail nets: Thompson Seedless grapes grown under plastic cover showed better yield (18.42 t/ha) as compared to anti-hail net (16.8 t/ha) and open conditions (13.09 t/ha). Bunches produced under plastic and anti-hail net had PLW below 5% even on 10th day as compared to 5% physiological loss of weight (PLW) at 7 days in bunches produced under open conditions. High density planting: Technology of high density planting (8 m×4 m) under hedge row planting with higher fruit yield (20.11 t/ha) in 10 year old litchi cv. Shahi was standardized. Minimizing fruit decay during storage: Pre-harvest prophylactic spray (2 days before anticipated harvest) of salicylic acid (2 mM) significantly reduced browning and fruit decay during post-harvest storage of litchi under refrigerated conditions (5–8°C and 80±5% RH) up to 18 days.
