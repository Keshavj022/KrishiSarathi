18±0.44, 19.66±0.63, 28.18±0.72 and 34.48±0.77 kg at 3,6,9 and 12 months, respectively. The body weight gain in intensive system of management was 94.0 g/day during 6-9 months of age. Heritability estimates for weight at birth, 3,6,9 and 12 months of age were 0.23±0.07, 0.22±0.07, 0.22±0.07, 0.0.36±0.08, respectively. The heritability estimates for 90, 140 days and total milk yield were 046±0.18, 0.55±0.19 and 0.55±0.19, respectively. Genetic Improvement of Barbari Goats for Meat and Milk Production Genetic improvement of Barbari goat for increased meat and milk production has resulted into an improved stock of the breed. There had been marked increase in the overall productivity of the flock over the years. The least squares means for body weight growth at birth, 3,6,9 and 12 months of age were 1.77±0.03, 7.08±0.18, 11.52±0.20, 16.21±0.59 and 20.79±0.55 kg, respectively, which were highest for previous 3 years. Year of birth, sex of kid, type of birth had significant effect on body weight up to 12 months of age. However, season of birth had significantly affected body weight at 9 and 12 months of age Jamunapari male selected from farmer’s flock at adopted village LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 97 only. The kids born during October-November had higher body weight at 9 and 12 months of age than those born during March-April. Males had higher body weight than females at all the ages. Single born kids had significantly higher body weight than twin and multiple born kids at all the ages. Year of kidding significantly affected the 90 days milk, 140 days milk yield and lactation yield. Season of kidding affected lactation length, however, lactation order and type of kidding had no influence on lactation traits. Age at first mating was 329±19.78 days, which was lowest and subsequently there was significant reduction in age at first kidding, a positive impact reproduction management. AICRP on Goat Improvement Jamunapari flock maintained under farm conditions at the CIRG, Makhdoom, attained body weight of 24.57±0.67 kg at 12 months of age. The feed lot kids attained maximum gain of 92.8±5.88 g/day during 3-6 months of age. The part lactation yields for 90 and 140 days were 64.04±1.59 and 88.24±2.21 kg respectively. Breeding efficiency on the basis of does tupped was 90.73%. Bucks were selected using an index combining 9 months body weight and 90 days milk yield of the dam. Breed improvement of programme was taken up in Jagtoli and Nagla Kadhori villages. The kids attained a body weight of 24.54±1.14 kg at 9 months of age under field conditions. The average daily milk yield of Jamunapari goat was 1.12±0.01 kg/day. The kidding rate and twinning were 1.41 and 50.5%, respectively. The Barbari flock maintained at the CIRG, Makhdoom, registered a population growth of 76.96%. The kids attained the body weight of 20.97±0.55 kg at 12 months of age. The part lactation yields for 90 and 140 days were 61.78±2.74 kg and 76.25±9.04 kg respectively.
