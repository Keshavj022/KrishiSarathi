 Disease detection sensors analyze plant physiological changes or pathogen presence to identify potential infections. Pest mon- itoring sensors detect the presence of pests and help in imple- menting targeted pest management strategies. Stress sensors measure various plant responses, such as leaf temperature TABLE 2: Types of tensiometers used in smart farming. Tensiometers Types Applications Advantages Measure soil matric potential or tension Traditional tensiometers Agriculture: optimize irrigation schedules Direct measurement of soil moisture tension, accurate representation of plant needs Electronic tensiometers Research: soil–plant–water studies Continuous monitoring, remote data collection Suction cup tensiometers Environmental monitoring: natural habitats Nondestructive, suitable for temporary installations Cable tensiometers Soil science: water movement studies Suitable for long-term monitoring, less frequent maintenance Removable tensiometers Horticulture: greenhouse monitoring Minimizes soil disturbance during installation TABLE 3: Types of capacitance-based soil moisture sensors. Capacitance sensors Types Applications Advantages Measure soil moisture content using capacitance Single-point capacitance sensors Precision agriculture: irrigation management Nondestructive installation, continuous soil moisture monitoring [12] Proﬁle capacitance sensors Horticulture: greenhouse management Vertical proﬁling of soil moisture, suitable for various soil depths Area or grid capacitance sensors Environmental studies: soil water distribution Large-scale monitoring of soil moisture variability Plant-based capacitance sensors Research: plant water status assessment Noninvasive measurement of plant water stress Journal of Sensors 5 or chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, to gauge the health and stress levels of crops. 2.1.6. Weather and Environmental Sensors. Weather and environmental sensors collect data on climatic conditions that directly impact crop growth and health. Temperature and humidity sensors provide information on microclimates within the ﬁeld, enabling precise microclimate management. Rainfall sensors measure precipitation, assisting in water management and irrigation decisions. Wind sensors assess wind speed and direction, crucial for planning pesticide applications and preventing drift. The integration of these smart sensors into precision agriculture enables farmers to gain real-time insights into soil and crop conditions. By understanding spatial variability and making data-driven decisions, farmers can optimize resource utilization, reduce input costs, and enhance overall agricul- tural efﬁciency. The data obtained from these types of smart sensors summarized in Table 6 are often analyzed using data analytics and AI techniques, enabling predictive modeling and precise intervention strategies to promote sustainable and environmentally responsible agricultural practices [15].
