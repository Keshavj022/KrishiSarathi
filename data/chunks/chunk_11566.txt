 Our KVKs strived for the in-situ management of rice residues in the villages of Haryana, Punjab and western UP through mass awareness, technology transfer and demonstration of mechanization solutions. We could register over 40% reduction in the residue burning events in 2018 as evident over 2016 from remote sensing imageries. This is a milestone in the area of farm mechanization and its implementation through the financial support of the Central Government. ICAR worked with greater emphasis in difficult and remote areas such as Leh-Ladakh, high hills in the north-eastern region and also in Andaman and Nicobar Island. ICAR inked MoUs with Science Departments/organizations in the country, namely DBT, CSIR, ICMR and ICFRE, and other reputed institutions like IIT (D) and IMD to harness the synergy to excel in challenging areas and address farmers problems. During these five years, our coordination and collaboration with international research centres and organizations was also improved very significantly bringing visible impacts. ICAR was rewarded with Global Gene Stewardship Award 2018 by the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative for the work on systematic gene deployment to manage rust diseases in wheat. It was a matter of pride that for the first time, ICAR Tableau on 26th January 2019 with the theme 'Kisan Gandhi' won the Best Tableau Prize. Several reforms and new initiatives were brought about to enhance the much-needed efficiency and chart new courses to meet the current as well as the future challenges. In this document, we have compiled the significant achievements of DARE/ ICAR during 2014-19 and compared with the previous five years for the benefit of the stakeholders. I trust that it will provide a glimpse of our wholistic and sustained efforts in agricultural R&D for the benefit of the country. It would be our pleasure to receive feedbacks and suggestions to strengthen our activities in future. (T.
