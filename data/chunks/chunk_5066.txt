 type or concentration was sprayed per 25 plants. These treatments were thought to affect both aphid population and growth of cabbage (Fig. 10). Though the aged urine treatments were more effective than the fresh urine treatments, this difference in effectiveness was not very significant, as both aged and fresh urine treatments reduced the number of aphids substantially with almost same time. Again, 30% and 100% concentration treatments were more effective than 10% and 20% urine concentration treatments. There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of 30% and 100% urine concentration treatments. Hence, it is better to use 30%urine concentration for the practical use. All the urine types (cow urine, buffalo urine and sheep urine), whether fresh or  HORTICULTURAL CROPS Table 12.

Fig. 10. Comparative effect of different urine types and cow-dung ash on number of aphids per plant aged, showed nearly similar effects for similar concentration levels without any significant difference. None of the treatments, i.e. cattle urine and cowdung ash, showed any marked effect on the number of leaves per plant and on the height of cabbage plant. Though there is slight difference in the initial stages after the spray for these parameters but they all become insignificant in the later stages. Comparative effects of monocrotophos and aged cow urine spray on cabbage aphid Monocrotophos provided complete control of aphid populations on day I after treatment and was the best. The aged cow urine on first day of treatment were satisfactory at par with control. On day 10 and onwards the treatment effects were significant. Aged cow urine 100%, aged cow urine 50% and ACU 25% provided aphid control, decreasing with the concentration of bio-pesticides. On day 40, aged cow urine 100% provided full control followed by aged cow urine 50% and 25%. All the treatments were superior to the control (Table 12). CONCLUSION Results of the study showed that cattle urine treatment is effective in controlling aphids in cabbage. Therefore in application of cowdung ash, fresh urine treatments took a little longer time for pest eradication than aged urine.
