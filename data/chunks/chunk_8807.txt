 Diversification of rice-wheat system by berseem or oats for fodder once in 3 years also reduced weed infestation. In yellow rust, 8 pathotypes were observed. The Yr 9 virulence (46S119), which has virulence for both Yr 2 and Yr 9, was most widespread pathotype. Pathotype 40A was the most frequent pathotype of black rust in the country, and pathotype 295 was recorded from Maharashtra only. Protein Content in Wheat The average protein content in Indian wheat is around 11.0%, but there were several grain lots that had even 14% protein. Since the demand for such a wheat (14%) is only 4 to 5 million tonnes. For this demand, after a NIR (Near Infra Red)- based protein scan, which takes only few minutes to estimate protein content, grain lots with acceptable protein can be procured and separately stored for trade and value-addition. BISCUIT-MAKING QUALITY OF WHEAT Baking test: The baking test could indicate the availability of some lines with good biscuit-making quality. WHEAT GERMPLASM HAVING GOOD AND POOR BISCUIT-MAKING QUALITY (Good biscuit lines (Biscuit diameter/thickness) >7.5 and up to 10.0) HP1856, HPW74, HPW89, HPW114, HPW143, HUW37, HY173, NI5406, CITR4793, TW‘S, E839, E4530, E4542, E4812-A, EC378772, EC378773, EC378788, EC378790, EC378793 MAIZE Crop Improvement A composite IC 9001 has been identified for irrigated and rainfed areas of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh. ● ●● ●● In maize, genotypes resistant/tolerant to downy mildew, maydis leaf blight, post-flowering stalk-rot, turcicum leaf blight, excess soil moisture and to drought have been identified. ● Seed Tech 2324, orange yellow, semiflint type maize has been recommended for kharif in irrigated areas of the country.
