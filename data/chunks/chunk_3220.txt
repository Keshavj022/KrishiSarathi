 Efforts to produce monocrotophos and dicofol resistant strains of Neoseiulus longispinosus has been successful, strains resistant to recommended concentrations of the pesticides have been developed. • Virulent isolates of Hirsutella thompsoni, Beauveria basssiana, Fusarium moniliforme, Paecilomyces fumosoroseus infecting eriophyid and tetranychid mites, which can be possibly employed in the biological control of mites, have been collected. Mite biodiversity and Taxonomy • Efforts to document of mite biodiversity of different regions of the country have been undertaken by all the centres. As a result 24 new genera and 50 new species of Eriophyidae have been described mainly from tree species. In Phytoseiidae, fifty species including 10 species of Amblyseius, 5 species of Typhlodromus, 2 species of Phytoseiulus been recorded on shrubs and trees from different agro climatic regions of Karnataka. A predatory thrips, Scolothrips rhagebianus has been recorded, feeding on Tetranychus sp in Coimbatore. Host plant resistance against mite pests • Studies showed that the two‐spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae prefers middle canopy leaves of tomato plant compared to top and bottom canopy leaves. Resistance to this mite in tomato genotypes likes LA 1740, LA 1777, LA 280 and LA 2963 is attributed to glandular trichomes and biochemicals like methyl ketones (2 tridecanones and 2 undecanone), phenols and acylsugars. In coconut, West Coast Tall X Choughat Orange Dwarf, West Coast Tall X Gangabondam, West Coast Tall X Malaysian Yellow Dwarf, Gangabondam X Fiji, Gangabondam X Philippine Ordinary, Gangabondam X Lakshadweep Ordinary have been found fairly tolerant to the perianth eriophyid mite showing lower mite damage. • The sugarcane spider mite, Oligonychus indicus, was found to cause more damage, in Gujarat, on susceptible varieties like, CoN – 85134, CoN – 85132, 93078, CoN 91132,2001‐ 7,CoJN‐964, COVSI‐9275, while varieties Co‐ 2001‐8, Co‐2001‐10, C0‐93337, Co‐ 85004,403,336,23, Co‐ 99010 and Co‐99012 were observed to be tolerant to the mite attack but the levels of phenols and acylsugars did not correlate with the intensity of resistance. Among chilli varieties, KA‐2 in Karnataka, Jwala, RHRC Erect, CHI and MS‐12 in Punjab and AEG‐77 in Gujarat and Indam‐10 in West Bengal have been found less susceptible to the yellow mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus, whereas the chilli varieties CH‐ 3, Punjab Gucchedar, S‐2530 and bell pepper variety SPH‐6 were found to be high susceptible to the damage by this mite. • The okra varieties Punjab 7 and Punjab 8 have been assessed as tolerant to the attack of Tetranychus sp. Ecology of mites • Studies on seasonal activity of the yellow mite infesting chillies in Navsari indicated that the mite is present throughout the year but distinct peaks are reached during second www.icar.org.in 110 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science fortnight of October and first fortnight of January (causing 40% leaf curling).
