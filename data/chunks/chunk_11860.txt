 Hariana bullocks had capacity to pull moderate load of 8 quintals for about 2 hours without showing any serious effect on the physiological status. Since the year 2010, genetic improvements of Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal breeds in their home tracts have been undertaken by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in collaboration with State Agricultural/Veterinary Universities and ICAR institutes. The data recording of Gir and Kankrej cows is being done by involving the farmers and registering their animals in the respective home tracts (Gujarat) whereas, the data recording units of Sahiwal breed are located at GADVASU, Ludhiana, LUVAS, Hisar and GBPUA&T, Pantnagar. About13557 Gir, 6200 Kankrej and 813 Sahiwal cows from the farmers/Organized herds were registered. Total 219823 frozen semen doses of Gir, 143482 of Kankrej and 174172 of Sahiwal cattle were produced out of which 62494, 46936 and 106522 semen doses of respective breeds have been utilized/ sold since inception for AI in the farm and the field to augment milk production. A total of 160708, 71436 and 88642 semen doses of Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal, respectively, are available for future breeding. The improved females calves of Gir (5490), Kankrej (2743) and Sahiwal (1003) breeds were produced. The identified elite females had average lactation yield of 3238 kg in Gir, 3553 kg in Kankrej and 3393 kg in Sahiwal breeds. Similarly, increase in milk production of Frieswal cattle from 3285 in 2014 to 3336 kg in 2019 in a standard lactation of 300 days obtained showing improvement of 1.55%. Overall improvements in milk yields of (305 days) of Gir, Sahiwal and Kankrejbreeds were found to be 36.73, 24.33 and 20.02%, respectively, during a short span of 10 years only (2010 to 2019). Besides this, a few more indigenous cattle breeds namely; Tharparkar and Rathi of Rajasthan, Ladakhi cattle of Ladakh and Khillar from Karnataka state are also being proposed in forthcoming plan (2021-2025). 4.1. Characterization and Conservation of Cattle Genetic Resource About 73% of Indian cattle population is uncharacterized and regarded as non-descript, which poses major hurdle in conservation and improvement of these animals. Sustained efforts are being made for characterization and conservation of the remaining cattle genetic resources of the country by ICAR-National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR), Karnal. The non-descript cattle of the country are being studied for their morphological, biochemical and molecular characteristics for their recognition as breeds. As such, till date 50 cattle breeds of the country have been characterized and gazette notified in The Gazette of Govt. of India. NBAGR is also working on the in-situ and ex-situ conservation of the endangered/critical/ threatened cattle breeds. A national gene bank is also being maintained at NBAGR with semen from large number of indigenous cattle breeds.
