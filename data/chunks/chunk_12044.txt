Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/ species): RhizoNBAIM: A liquid formulation having highly efficient nitrogen fixing rhizobial strains specific to chickpea, pigeonpea, mungbean, urdbean, groundnut, pea and lentil. 2. Target crops and delivery system: Rhizobia are specific for leguminous crops. Rhizobia specific to chickpea, pigeonpea, mungbean, urdbean, groundnut, pea and lentil have been developed for seed inoculation. 3. Target agroecological zones (if any)): All 4. Validation and commercialization: The technology has been validated for pigeonpea, chickpea, mungbean, pea and lentil at ICAR- NBAIM experimental fields. The technology is commercialized and is on the website of Agrinnovate India Ltd. 5. Benefits: RhizoNBAIM when applied as seed inoculant can save 25-30 kg N/ha and enhance the yield by 7-10% over uninoculated control. 6.

Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/ species): ZincFort is a bacterial bioformulation containing an endophytic Arthrobacter sp. It has a longer shelf life (12 – 24 months) without loss of microbial populations and properties upon exposure to high temperature. 2. Target crops and delivery system: This bioformulation can be used for wheat. Inoculation can be done through seed treatment. 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): All 4. Validation and commercialization: The technology has been tested at farms of ICAR-IARI, New Delhi, ICAR-NBAIM, Mau and three centres of Punjab Agriculture University, Ludhiana. 5. Benefits: This formulation has shown remarkable response in improving the Zn content in wheat grains without compromising the yield. Inoculation can result in ~35-40% increase in Zn content (~45-50 ppm) in grains. Besides, this formulation significantly improves root architecture which can also improve other nutrient and water use efficiency. 6.
