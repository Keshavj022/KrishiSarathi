 In the first phase (July 1 to Sep. 15), 65 poly-lined tanks were constructed/renovated. All poly- tanks were constructed at spots identified through GIS contour mapping for maximum water collection without obstructing water flow to the natural stream. All poly-lined tanks were geotagged indicating farmer’s name on the map. Variations in depth and slope of tanks were decided as per the contour, soil type and rainfall in the area. All tanks were lined with silpaulin. A total of 33.31 (33.32 including renovated structures) million litre water harvesting capacity was added in the area. Analysis of rainfall data of the area from 1900–2018 indicated that these tanks will be able to harvest 78–1,000 m3 rainwater in different months of the year. expanded. There was loss of market due to exorbitant freight cost involved in transporting the bulky consignments of fresh fruits to mainland, hence, a noni processing plant was established and since then selling Noni as processed material to mainland has started. Given the huge demand for noni pulp in the mainland @ 10 t/week @ ` 200/kg and the assured market price of noni juice @ ` 750/450 ml, the acreage under Noni was expanded for another 79 ha at Minne Bay, North Bay and Chunnabhatta with its own saplings of CIARI Sampada and other promising varieties, Efficient utilization of dried Cymbidium leaves in traditional art-crafts Under the waste to wealth programme, a technique to utilize the waste dry leaves of Cymbidium orchids in preparation of art-crafts like fruit and vegetable baskets, containers, sitting mats etc. were successfully standardized and demonstrated in Sikkim. RESEARCH FOR TRIBAL AND HILL REGIONS DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 139 than 773 training programmes, 1,750 frontline demonstrations and 137 awareness camps/exhibitions/ exposure visits etc. leading to the capacity building and awareness among more than 25,000 tribal farmers. KVKs: Under Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) during the year, KVKs across the country conducted 6,009 on-farm trials and 34,958 frontline demonstrations. Capacity development of 607,936 farmers/farm women and 60,136 extension personnel was achieved through training programs. Extension activities organized by the KVKs under TSP benefited 971,423 participants. The technological inputs like seeds (33,121 q), planting material (58.84 lakh) and livestock strains and fish fingerlings (15.64 lakh) were produced by KVKs. Besides analyzing 86,040 samples of soil, water, plant and manure, mobile advisory services were sent to 36.12 lakh farmers on various aspects of agriculture. District Agricultural Meteorological Units (DAMU): Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) is establishing weather observing system and development of Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa in the country. In pursuance of this, IMD has sanctioned DAMUs which are multidisciplinary units in selected KVKs for preparation and dissemination of district and sub-district agro-met advisories under ATARIs.
