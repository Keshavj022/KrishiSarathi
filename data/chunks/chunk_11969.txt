 Sustainable Development Goals Gandhiji has been a strong advocate of strengthening rural India and agriculture-led development, which form the bedrock of sustainable development goals (SDGs), particularly those about achieving zero hunger, ending poverty, securing education, health, employment, gender equity, climate change adaptation and mitigation. His environment-friendly lifestyle, simple, traditional systems of life amply provide the recipes for achieving the SDGs. Gandhiji’s teachings reflect to a large extent the importance of sustainability in all development fields propounded by SDGs with a focus on rural background. He mentioned that, “We should not 141 look upon the natural resources – water, air, land – as inheritance from our forefathers; rather consider them as loan given by our next generation”. Nutrition security is one of the important SDG targets to be achieved by 2030. The current push to promote “eat local”, would lead to having more fresh, high quality food and to leave a low carbon footprint by reducing transportation of food, thus, benefitting the local farmers, rural economy, soil health and ecology. This is an important strategy for climate action, one of the important SDGs. 4. Lessons Learnt and Way Forward India ranks second in the world agricultural production and is the leading producer of food grains, horticultural crops, cotton, dairy and poultry, aquaculture, and spices. India’s agricultural GDP rose from $25 billion (1970s) to $401 billion (2017), registering a stupendous growth of $376 billion out of which $300 billion increase was recorded during the period from 2001-2017 (NAAS Presidential Address, 2019). The net area under cultivation increased from 118.75 Mha (1950-51) 140.86 Mha in 1970-71 and has largely remained constant since then. (Directorate of Economics and Statistics, GOI). Foodgrain production increased from 50.82 million tonnes (1950-51) to 284.95 million tonnes (2018-19). Similarly, horticulture produce of 313.85 million tonnes in 2018-19 showed significant gain as compared to 166.94 million tonnes in 2004-05. The total livestock population increased from 292.80 (1951) to 535.82 (2019) millions. The total fish production increased from 1.536 million tonnes (1990-91) to 13.422 million tonnes (2018-19) (Pocket Book of Agricultural Statistics 2019, GOI). Gandhiji always wanted India to be self-sufficient. “My idea of self-sufficiency is that villages must be self-sufficient in regard to food, cloth and other basic necessities. But even this can be overdone. Therefore, you must grasp my idea properly...” (Gandhi 1959). The Green Revolution in India which had begun in the mid-1960s had been instrumental in transforming from the traditional agriculture to intensive farming. Introduction of high-yielding varieties replaced the traditional rice varieties consumed before the Green Revolution and the availability of local rice varieties has decreased.
