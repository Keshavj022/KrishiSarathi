Aquatic weeds are less of a threat with proper drainage and water pumping from central portion to establish the crop and provide irrigation. Income of poor farmers who own deep-water or low-lying waterlogged regions is increased by successful rice-fish culture. Best way to accomplish this is by farmer participation, which includes on-farm trial, demonstrations to test the technology adaptability, compatibility, and feedback data for technology improvement based on farmers’ needs. Improved production technology Nursery management: November –December to May–June is the growing month for Boro rice. Low temperature stress affect crop growth stages, i.e. seed germination, emergence, seedling establishment, early vegetative growth during rabi. Low temperatures impair seed germination and cause seedling to grow slowly. As a result, Boro rice requires special management of nursery to avoid the cold injury (Table 2). Land preparation: When enough water is available, field should first be ploughed 3–4 times before being laddered. After a week, field needs to be ploughed twice more, followed by laddering in wet condition to produce puddles. Transplanting: After second week of January, when temperature begins to rise over 10°C, Boro rice is transplanted. Depending on variety, a Boro rice seedling can grow to a height of 12–15 cm and 4–6 leaves in two months.
