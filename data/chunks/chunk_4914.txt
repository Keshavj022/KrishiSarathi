 Income has also improved, with some cultivars yielding income increases over 40%. The app has boosted farmers’ knowledge, with adoption of best practices in harvesting, weeding, shade management, and pest control rising from below 30% to over 90%. Adoption of recommended propagation, irrigation, and nutrient management practices has similarly increased, raising water use efficiency and reducing soil erosion. Overall, the app has enabled farmers to implement advanced techniques, driving both productivity and income improvements across the region. Darjeeling Mandarin mobile app: In 2022, IARI launched an Android-based 'Darjeeling Mandarin App' to provide agro-advisory services for mandarin orange growers in the Darjeeling and Sikkim hills. Developed with React Native and Google Firebase, the app offers guidance on agronomy, pest and disease management, and soil health. The app’s accessibility on low-spec devices, plus direct expert support via call or WhatsApp, has made it popular, with 563 installations and over 1,671 expert consultations. In 2023, content validation through Content Validation Index (CVI) with 250 farmers showed high satisfaction (CVI 0.83), noting improved clarity, relevance, and cultural suitability. The app has enabled a 20% yield increase, raising income from `1.5 lakh to 2.5 lakh per acre.
