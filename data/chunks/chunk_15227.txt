 These sensors come in various types as summarized in Table 1 help farmers, researchers, and land managers optimize irrigation practices, enhance crop yields, and conserve water resources. The working principle of vol- umetric soil moisture sensors involves measuring the dielec- tric constant of the soil. The dielectric constant is a property of a material that reﬂects its ability to store electrical charges in an electric ﬁeld [10]. When the soil is moist, it contains more water, which has a higher dielectric constant than dry soil. By comparing the dielectric constant of the soil to a known value representing completely dry soil, the sensor can calculate the volumetric water content. 2.1.2. Tensiometers. Tensiometers are specialized instru- ments used to measure the soil’s matric potential or tension, which is an indicator of how strongly the soil retains water. These devices are widely used in agriculture, horticulture, and environmental research to monitor soil moisture levels and help optimize irrigation practices. Tensiometers provide valuable insights into the soil’s ability to hold water, enabling farmers and researchers to make acquainted choices con- cerning the timing of irrigation and the management of water resources. The working principle of a tensiometer is based on the concept of capillary action. The instrument consists of a porous ceramic cup or tube at the bottom and a transparent, airtight tube above it. The ceramic container is ﬁlled with water and placed underground at the preferred depth in the soil. As the soil loses moisture, the water from the ceramic container is pulled into the soil through capillary action [11]. The tube above the ceramic cup is connected to a pressure gauge or a data logger. As the water level in the tube decreases due to water moving into the soil, a vacuum is TABLE 1: Smart farming—volumetric soil moisture sensor types. Volumetric soil moisture sensor Type Applications Advantages Measure the actual volume of water in the soil using dielectric constant measurements Time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) Precision agriculture: crop irrigation and management Provides highly accurate and reliable data, suitable for various soil types.

Helps conserve water resources and optimize irrigation practices Impedance sensors Research: studying soil water dynamics; land reclamation: restoring degraded; land weather forecasting: early warning systems for drought Real-time monitoring, minimal soil disturbance during installation 4 Journal of Sensors created within the tube. The pressure gauge measures this vacuum, which is directly related to the soil’s matric potential or tension.
