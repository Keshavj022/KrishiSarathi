 The lethal feeding period (LFP50) and lethal feeding dose (LFD50) of anticoagulant was 5.5 days and 2.41 g/100 g body weight. In no-choice test, freshly prepared bajra-based bait of Difethialone, resulted in cent percent mortality of Tatera indica (gerbil) and Funambulus pennanti (squirrels) in one-day exposure. However, in choice tests, one-day exposure yielded 80% mortality in gerbils and 50% in squirrels. The death period ranged between 6 and 11 days for T. indica and 4 and 9 days for F. pennanti. On increasing exposure period to 2 days, the mortality rate of squirrels increased to 80% but in T. indica 2 days exposure showed no change in mortality rate, however, the duration of mortality was brought down to 4–8 days. AGRICULTURAL ACAROLOGY Mite infestation in rice. Mite infestation on popular hill rice, Jaya, Mandya Vijaya, Rasi, IR 30864, Mukthi, Tellahamsa, and a hybrid KRH 2 ranged from 12% (Tellahamsa) to 60% (KRH 2). Similar damage was observed in Kothamadi, Eru, Unn, Navasari and Mohanpura areas in Gujarat. Screening of available rice lines to spidermite (Oligonychus oryzae) during September–October in Coimbatore showed IR 64616H, IR 76715 H, PSBRC 2, IR 69612H, IR 65622-151-1-2-2R free from mite damage and entries IR 71625H, IR 69701-CP-138-C1-304-1-12 highly susceptible. Mite infestation on chilli. In Gujarat, yellow mite Polyphagotarsonemus latus, a serious pest of chilli crop, showed 2 distinct peaks in last week of October and beginning of December, with no activity of any predators. Leaf curling in 38% plants inflicted 28% green chillies yield loss. Jwala, RHRC Erect, ACG 77 and ACS 92-2 were fairly tolerant with minimum leaf curling (4-9 mites/15 leaves), and varieties G 4 and PBS 86-1 (with 39 mites/15 leaves) were susceptible. In Kalyani, hybrid chilli Line 86235 was relatively tolerant and varieties Jhulan, Bullet and Suryamukhi were highly susceptible. PESTICIDE RESIDUES Out of 796 samples of different vegetables, 61% were contaminated with DDT, HCH, Endosulfan, Chlorpyriphos, and out of which 12% exceeded their maximum residual limit (MRL) values. In fruits, out of 378 samples, 48% were contaminated with different pesticides but none of them contained residues above MRL value. About 40% of 92 samples of spices from the market were contaminated. Residues of DDT, HCH, Endosulfan and Chlorpyriphos were detected in 264 vegetarian and 243 non-vegetarian human diet samples, 11% vegetarian and 15% non-vegetarian samples exceeded their MRL values. Out of 468 bovine-milk samples, 65% samples were contaminated with HCH and DDT; out of which 15% were above MRL value. In 98 animal feed and fodder samples, 52% were contaminated with HCH, DDT, Dicofol, Malathion and Endosulfan. Besides 59% groundwater and 65% surface water samples were found containing DDT and HCH. Out of 67 rain-water samples, 20% were contaminated with HCH, DDT, Endosulfan and Chlorpyriphos.
