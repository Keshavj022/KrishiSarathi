 Climate-smart sustainable soil and land management in rainfed agriculture – Way forward A multi-pronged approach is essential to overcome the barriers in adopting climate-smart sustainable soil and land management practices in rainfed systems, which is evident from the case studies. The adoption of climate-smart sustainable soil and land management practices in rainfed systems can be significantly enhanced using advanced tools like DSM, remote sensing, and Geographical Information System (GIS). DSM provides high-resolution data on soil properties, allowing farmers to make informed decisions regarding crop selection, irrigation, and precise nutrient management. Remote sensing and GIS technologies enable real-time monitoring of soil health, moisture content, and land- use changes, helping to identify erosion-prone areas and assess drought impacts. These technologies can be integrated into mobile-based advisory systems, offering farmers site-specific recommendations on sustainable practices. Capacity-building programs across various stakeholder levels should be developed to train farmers and extension workers on the use of DSM products, land use advisories, GIS, and precision agriculture techniques, while also ensuring access to affordable technology. Incentivizing the adoption of these tools through financial support, such as subsidies for soil testing and equipment, can encourage widespread use. Additionally, combining DSM data with climate models can create early warning systems for extreme weather events, allowing for proactive planning and risk mitigation in rainfed systems. Institutional support is vital to promote the integration of digital tools into national land management policies, fostering data sharing and standardization. SUMMARY Integrating soil resource information through advanced technologies like DSM and GIS is essential for achieving sustainable soil management and climate resilience in India’s rainfed agricultural systems. These tools enable precise and informed decisions on land use, soil conservation and water management. As rainfall patterns continue to fluctuate due to climate change, the role of accurate soil resource information will remain indispensable in achieving sustainable agricultural practices. The Bureau has been empowering farmers and policymakers to make informed decisions on soil conservation, nutrient management, and crop selection by providing the necessary tools such as digital soil maps and climate-smart advisories, as evident from the regional case studies. By leveraging such data-driven approaches across different landscapes and at different scales, rainfed agriculture can become more productive, sustainable, and adaptive to future climate conditions. However, the success of the whole endeavor depends on continued investment in capacity building, institutional support, and the dissemination of these technologies to farmers.
