However hardly any farmer is currently practicing this technique. Demonstrations and awareness programmes are to be conducted to popularize this technique for improving rice productivity.   Water efficient rice production systems: Water surfaces have a higher evaporation rate than soil. Evaporative water loss can also be reduced by adopting the production systems and technologies, which shorten the duration that the field is flooded and/ or requirement for water application.
