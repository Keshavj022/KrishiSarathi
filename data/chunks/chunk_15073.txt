 Digitalization and adopting digital technologies, like using remote sensing (RS) sensors and data, cloud platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE) (https://earthengine.google.com/), and precision farming tech- niques can further expand CRA (Sirmacek and Vinuesa, 2022). Programs such as Digital India (https://www.investindia.gov.in/team-india-b logs/digital-india-revolutionising-tech-landscape) can drive tech sector growth while improving farm resource management. Training farmers in climate-smart practices can support broader educational and rural development goals, enhancing resilience and advancing skill develop- ment (Arulmanikandan et al., 2024). Collaboration among government, private sector, and civil society is also essential for attracting investment in climate-smart agricultural technologies and infrastructure, support- ing India’s aims of increased agricultural productivity and rural job creation. 10. Challenges in implementing CRA Implementing CRA in India requires addressing several inter- connected challenges across socioeconomic, cultural, institutional, technological, and policy domains. Socioeconomic and Cultural Barriers: Smallholders often face poverty and limited access to essential resources like credit, high-quality seeds, and agricultural inputs, hindering the adoption of CRA techniques (Kapari et al., 2023). Additionally, traditional practices and cultural norms, including those tied to gender, may discourage the shift to CRA. Farmers’ preference for familiar methods, coupled with limited aware- ness and educational deficits, exacerbates these challenges and re- inforces the gender divide in agriculture, contributing to the disconnect between researchers and end-users (Huyer et al., 2021; Okoronkwo et al., 2024). Awareness and Information Gaps: Although numerous initiatives and policies have been established to tackle climate change adaptation, small and marginal farmers remain unaware of the available informa- tion and benefits (Cummings, 2019; Marques and Teixeira, 2023). This gap persists even with the presence of automated weather stations and skilled field staff monitoring farm activities in real time. - Infrastructure and Mechanization: While machinery subsidies have been provided, inadequate infrastructure (e.g., roads, electricity, storage facilities) poses challenges to mechanized agriculture, with unpredictable monsoons further complicating adaptation efforts (Eeswaran et al., 2021). - Financial Awareness and Market Access: Many farmers lack under- standing of financial tools like loans and insurance, which affects their resilience building and profitability (Calle et al., 2020). Restricted market access for CRA products, such as organic crops, also limits potential economic benefits. - Technological and Data Challenges: Limited access to modern agri- cultural technologies and insufficient R&D investment restrict the development of locally relevant solutions (Ukhurebor et al., 2021).
