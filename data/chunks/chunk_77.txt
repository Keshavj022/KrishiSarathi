It is established fact that rural women plays vibrant role in Indian agriculture and economy but the irony with women farmer is, that the role played by them is always undervalued and the tag of ‘helping hand' has not changed yet. The performance of women farmers is always appreciable and they can succeed in many avenues but they face lot of challenges like limited access to inputs (land, seed, fertilizers etc.), critical services (capacity building) and organized markets to prove their existence as compared to male counterparts. So there is an urgent need of strengthening and empowering the Indian rural women for holistic development of society and our country. *Corresponding author email: skumar710@gmail.com JOURNEY of KVKs — Farm Science Centres “4 Change of First KVK in Oni mandate with Puducherry Tos ‘ine time 21st March 1974 —_ o ° a Technology Vocational trainin Assessment & Refinement Single Window Knowledge, Resource and Capacity Development Indian Farming March 2024 29 Indian Farming 30 March 2024 Fish farming An ocean of opportunity for enhanced income and livelihood S K Singh1, S K Dubey1*, Seema Yadav1 and Raghwendra Singh1 1ICAR-Agricultural Technology Application Research Institute, Rawatpur, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh 208 002 Fish farming plays a vital role in improving the socio-economic conditions and livelihood of rural communities. Many studies have shown that pond fish farming is more profitable enterprise than rice cultivation, promoting many poor farmers in rural areas to switch to fish farming with the benefit cost ratio ranging from 1.7 to 1.9. Furthermore, the increasing human population has created a lot of pressure on diminishing agricultural land for food production. Fish farming can be considered as an alternative source of livelihood generation and may act as bridge for achieving one of the goals of SDGs (sustainable development goals) i.e. zero hunger.
