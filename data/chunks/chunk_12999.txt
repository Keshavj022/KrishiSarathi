 With the rapidly increasing demand for processed potato products, seed potato and specialty potatoes; tremendous benefits of eNAM and Model Act; and storage and transportation efficiencies Basic Framework for Doubling Farmers’ Income • Increase in production and productivity • Decreasing cost of cultivation • Reduction of post-harvest losses • Value addition • Reforms in Agricultural Marketing (eNAM and Model Act) • Risk, security and assistance • Allied activities  Horticulture (Huge potential, high value crops like potato)  Integrated farming system (income/ risk at small farms)  White revolution (65% higher income in one acre than crops)  Blue revolution (Punjab; demand is picking)  Sub-mission on agro-forestry (Supplementary income)  Beekeeping (Income of ` 2500/ box; without land resources)  Rural backyard poultry (Income/ nutritional security); Others (Mushroom, agri-tourism, consultancies for landless farmers) Estimated contribution of different components for Enhancing Farmers’ Income (EDI) Components of EFI % share Relevance for potato Crop productivity 17.6 Overweight on account of drip irrigation technology, better quality seed potato, better potato technologies and efficient dissemination of technical knowhow Livestock productivity 12.5 Nil Improvement in resource 13.3 Overweight due to soil use efficiency/cost health cards, neem oil reduction coated urea, drip irrigation application and fertigation Crop intensity 4.2 Nil Crop diversification 4.1 Overweight as higher area is estimated to come from low value crops to potato than just 4.1% Better price realisation 7.1 Overweight on account of higher demand for processed potato products, seed potato, specialty potatoes, eNAM, storage and transportation efficiencies. Shift to non-farm occupation 7.7 Nil Total increase in income in 66.5 7 years November–December 2019 47 are expected to create price realization for potato farmers sufficient enough to raise their farm income way higher than just 7.1%. Non-integration of agricultural markets in India as evident from the huge difference in prices of the same agri-commodity in different agricultural markets has been found a big cause of concern for potato farmers. This government has contemplated the idea of implementation of electronic National Agricultural Market (eNAM). So far more than 585 markets (in 16 states) have been enrolled under this scheme. This initiative will stop market malpractices and unreasonable variation of product prices in different markets of the country. This scheme has huge potential of ensuring higher price especially for the potato farmers without compromising their bargaining power in the market on the pretext of being small in size or carrying low volumes.
