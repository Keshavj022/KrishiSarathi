 In all the treatment groups the progressive reduction in size of wound was found highly significant at P<0.01 at interval of different days. On day 0 the size of the wound treated with juice of ridge gourd leaves was 4.04± 0.06 cm2, which showed progressive reduction to 0.83 ±.0.02 cm2 by day 18 after-treatment, whereas it was 4.01 ± 0.02 cm2 and 0.80 ± 0.0.01 cm2 on day 0 and 18 after-treatment respectively in the wounds treated with juice of ekdandi leaves. In Neosporin- treatment group, the size of the wound was 4.00 ± 0.01 cm2 and 0.86 ±.0.01 cm2 on days 0 and 18 after-treatment respectively (Table 2). The contraction of wound is a normal physiological phenomenon, indicating the process of healing. The percentage of wound contraction (%) was more evident up to day 9 after treatment in groups A and B compared with group C (Table 3). The subsequent observation on days 12,15,18 and 21 in all the treatment groups showed linear increasing trend in percentage of wound contraction and total contraction, of the wound (%) was observed on day 21 in all the groups (Graph 1). The mean and standard error of days required for complete healing of wounds were 19.9±0.02, 19.7±0.03 days respectively for the wounds treated with juice of ridge gourd and ekdandi leaves respectively, whereas it was 20.00±0.06 days in Neosporin-treatment group. The result are indicative of better healing ability of these herbs comparable to Neosporin ointment. At CSKHPKV, the wounds treated with ridge gourd extract (group C) were relatively drier when compared with other two groups on day 3 after operation. The wounds in this group were covered Contents VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Fig. 2. A. Negative control group (wound dressed with normal saline) at CSKHPKV Fig. 2. C. Test group (wounds dressed with ridge gourd extract) at CSKHPKV Fig. 2. B. Positive control group (wounds dressed with 5% Povidone-iodine suspension) at CSKHPKV with a relatively stronger transparent scab; whereas the wound covering in other two groups were too fragile which readily peeled off during dressing change-over (Fig. 2 Cl). The wound edges were quite raw with fragile vascular bed in group A, which bled easily during even a slight manipulation (Fig. 2 Al). In group B, though the bleeding tendency was not as marked as in group A, they still showed intermittent raw patches over wound surfaces (Fig. 2 Bl). Exudation and inflammatory changes of wounds were also least in group C and almost comparable in other two group at this stage. The wound contraction (%) was minimal and comparable between the groups (Table 4). On day after operation, the wounds in all the three groups exhibited development of healthy granulation tissue, which was covered with blackish yellow to transparent scab (Fig 2 A2, B2 and C2). Again, the scab covering was stronger in group C and fragile in the other two groups.
