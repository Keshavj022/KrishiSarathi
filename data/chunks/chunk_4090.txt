 VRPSel-17 (INGR21139): VRPSel-17 is unique in the fact that it bears only one flower (white) on all its flowering nodes and is not affected by external growing conditions including the environment. Over the years, the genotype exhibited consistent flowering behaviour of single FPP on all the reproductive nodes. The genotype is also resistant to powdery mildew and rust under natural field conditions. Despite its low pod yield (60-70 g/plant), this genotype can be used in a variety of genetic studies, including inheritance of flower numbers, flowering time, peduncle traits, seed and pod characters, disease studies, and so on. Field performance of VRPM-901-5, (a) appearance of five flowered raceme; (b) plant bearing five pods and four pods on single peduncle at multiple reproductive nodes, and (c) multi-flowering racemes at seed maturity. VRPSel-17 (INGR21139) VRPE-29 (INGR22087): VRPE-29 is an extra early vegetable pea genotype (Days to flower ≤32 days) in which pods are ready for picking in 60-65 days with average pod yield of 70 g/plant. The plants are determinate, with shorter internodal length, Ist flower appeared on 8th to 9th node onward. The pods are very attractive and slightly curved in shape, having on average 8 seeds/pod. Plant bears 10-12 dark green pods of 8-8.5 cm long, having pod width of 1.5 cm, average pod weight of 8-9.5 g, 100-green seed weight of 54 g, shelling percentage of 50% and pod yield potential of 90-100 q/ha. It has additional advantage of synchronous maturity (single picking) and can be easily fit for multiple cropping and high intensity cropping systems. Additionally, it could be a potential parent for breeding early maturing cultivars in peas.
