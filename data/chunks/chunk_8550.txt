 Three weir heights (15 cm, 20 cm and 25 cm) were constructed with refuges occupying about 6-8% of the area of the rice fields with depth of refuge kept at 1.8 m conducive for fish growth. Indian major carps (catla, rohu and mrigal) were stocked @ 20,000/ha only for 6 months with high-yielding rice varieties Jagannath and Padmini during the kharif. Results revealed that the average rice yield at the farmers’ field increased from 1.6 tonnes/ha (before intervention) to 4.65 tonnes/ha. The average fish yield from the system was 1,106.9 kg/ha in 6 months duration with improved average rice equivalent yield to 5.07 tonnes/ha with highest rice equivalent yield of 5.67 tonnes/ha obtained in 20 cm weir height plots. Utilizing the water stored in the refuges, the cropping intensity increased from 100% to 131%. Zero-tillage and other Water Management Methods In a study at the Sabajpura Farm, Patna, to find out the suitability of zero-tillage practices, other water management methods, the root parameters at tillering and flowering stages were highest under raised bed planting, with higher values under 5- and 7-cm depth of irrigation. Zero-tillage has given similar yield (3.26 tonnes/ ha) as obtained with conventional sowing (3.23 tonnes/ha) and raised bed planting (3.21 tonnes/ha). Mean water saving under zero-tillage and raised bed was 11.3 and 55.9%, respectively. Saving land preparation, sowing and irrigation were Rs 1,850, Rs 1,400 and Rs 450, respectively in zero-tillage. Maximum gross benefit of Rs 3,943/ha was achieved under raised bed with 3-cm depth of irrigation. The minimum benefit of Rs 481/ha was found under zero-tillage with 9-cm depth of irrigation. Multiple Use of Irrigation Water with Fishpond and Secondary Reservoir Efforts have been made to increase the productivity of the irrigation water through multiple use like fish production. A fishpond (16.5 m × 14.5 m × 2.25 m depth) with 1: 1 side slopes, lined with 250 micron low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film, was constructed at the Research Farm of the ICAR-RCER, Patna, to deliver pumped water to the tank in 4 nearly equal parts for better aeration and exchange of water for fish growth. Indian major carps (catla, rohu and mrigal) and Chinese carps, were grown in the pond at a density of 75,000/ha from July–August to harvest in February to May. The total harvest of fish was 10.89 tonnes/ha in 2000–01 and 6.22 tonnes/ha in 2001–02, respectively. Evaluation of Pressurized Irrigation Equipment Performance study of double nozzle and single nozzle type of sprinkler system (M/s Premier Irrigation Systems) has been conducted under various operating pressures for its application rate, uniformity coefficient and distribution efficiency. Various conclusions drawn were: (i) Double nozzles give higher value of uniformity as compared to single nozzle for same operating conditions; (ii) under low-wind condition (<1.
