 For example, robotic arms can be used to pick fruits and vegetables, planting and seeding with precision to detect and remove weeds, water crops with precision, spraying chemicals which are dangerous to human health. Overall, robotics has the potential to revolutionize agriculture in India by increasing efficiency, reducing labour costs and improving productivity. However, the use of robotics in agriculture requires significant investment in technology, research, and development. Additionally, farmers and farm workers must be trained in the use of robotics technology to ensure that it is used effectively. Artificial intelligence (AI): Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize Indian agriculture by enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions and optimize their crop yields. It can be effectively used for (i) predictive analytics, (ii) precision agriculture, (iii) pest and disease management, (iv) soil health management, (v) livestock herd management and dairy automation, (vi) aquaculture automation and management (vii) market prediction. In case of predictive analytics, AI can be used to analyse historical weather data and crop data to make predictions about future crop yields. This can help farmers to plan their planting and harvesting schedules and optimize their crop management practices. AI helps to identify pests and diseases early on and recommend appropriate treatment options. This can help farmers to minimize crop losses and reduce the need for chemical treatments. AI can be used to analyse soil data and provide recommendations for optimizing soil health. This can help farmers to reduce soil erosion, improve water retention and increase crop yields. Protected cultivation: Protected cultivation is the practice of growing crops under a controlled environment using structures such as greenhouses, shade net houses and polyhouses. This method of cultivation has become increasingly popular in Indian agriculture due to its ability to protect crops from adverse weather conditions, pests, and diseases. This reduces the cost of crop management and improves the quality of the crops. This is particularly beneficial for high-value crops such as vegetables and fruits, which require high- quality produce to fetch better prices in the market. The protected cultivation is an effective method of cultivation that can help Indian farmers to increase their productivity and income. However, it is important to ensure that the structures used for protected cultivation are sustainable and do not have adverse effects on the environment. Additionally, farmers should be trained in the use of protected cultivation techniques to ensure that they are used effectively. Vertical Farming: Vertical farming is a method of growing crops in vertically stacked layers using artificial lighting and a controlled environment.
