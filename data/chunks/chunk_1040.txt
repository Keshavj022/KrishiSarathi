In case of other small millets average area remained around 5 m ha till 1960 and then started declining gradually, remained above 4 m ha till 1980. In the next 25 years area fell down drastically reaching to less than 25% and then to 10% by 2020. The total production of small millets has declined by nearly 44%, though not in the same rate as area. In case of finger millet there was a gradual increase in production corresponding to the initial area increase, reached the highest of 3.20 m t in 1978–79, and thereafter started declining gradually. Overall, total production has actually risen by 12.5% from first 5 year plan to 12th plan despite area getting reduced by more than half during the same period, because of improvement in yield levels owing to adoption of high yielding varieties and production practices by the farmers. In case of other small millets the production levels were fluctuating and fell down more than 80%, while productivity has risen marginally from 380 kg/ha during 1950–51 to 800 kg/ha during 2019–20 at all India level. Interestingly in case of finger millet the yield levels have gone up from 649 kg/ha (1950–51) to 1747 kg/ha (2019–20) due to concerted crop improvement efforts and improved crop management practices. Distribution of small millets in India Among the small millets, finger millet is the most important crop grown in many states of India from mean sea level in coastal Andhra Pradesh to 8000 feet altitude in the Himalayas. The other small millets in decreasing order of area under cultivation are little, kodo, barnyard, foxtail, proso and browntop millet which are mostly concentrated in specific states/regions. The estimated area, production and productivity of small millets in India, and the important states for each crop are given in Table 3. The distribution of individual millet is not uniform though small millets are grown in almost every state/ region. Karnataka is the major finger millet growing state accounting to 65% of area and production (2019–20) followed by Uttarakhand and Tamil Nadu.
