 The adoption of climate tolerant varieties by farmers was most closely guided by self-satisficing and social norms decision-rules, with the model performance, under both scenarios, highest for marginal landholders. Marginal farmers are more likely to use these heuristics to adopt climate tolerant varieties as their decisions may not necessarily be geared towards increasing profit, unlike larger farmers. Social norms had a higher fit for the adoption of climate-related strategies, including enhanced irri­ gation, with model fit increasing, generally, with farm size. Agricultural policy and extension efforts that incorporate the varied motivations and heuristics of agricultural decision-making, rather than assuming adap­ tation as a utility maximization exercise, can better design, develop, and disseminate solutions to support the adaptive capacity of farmers. 1. Introduction Farmers in the global South encounter diverse social-ecological, climate, and market-related risks to their agricultural livelihood activ­ ities (Dasgupta et al., 2014). As a result, land, crop, and livestock-related adaptation strategies are widely accepted as critical for reducing prox­ imate livelihood risks (e.g., Agrawal and Perrin, 2009; Rockstr¨om et al., 2010; Antwi-Agyei et al., 2014; Duong et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2019). However, our understanding of the underlying decision-making pro­ cesses behind farmer adaptation is limited (¨Ohlm´erYr et al., 1998; Wilson et al., 2009; Keshavarz and Karami, 2014). Utility maximization or rational choice theory has dominated the field of mathematical modeling of human behavior and decision-making (e.g., Levine et al., 2015; Jager et al., 2000; Van Den Bergh et al., 2000; Gintis, 2000). Schlüter et al. (2017) attribute this bias to the ease of mathematical formulation of the utility maximization theory in formal * Corresponding author.

While numerous studies have attempted to model farmers’ adaptation behavior and outcomes, most models have been biased towards explicitly or implicitly incorporating utility maximiza­ tion as the primary decision heuristic or goal for farmers (Edwards-­ Jones, 2006; Berger and Troost, 2014; Davidson, 2016). According to Davidson (2016), who reviewed the gaps in agricultural climate adap­ tation literature: “All individual behavior is socially embedded and addressing the question of why farmers behave in certain ways requires research that reveals this social embeddedness. Many studies, however, resort to simplified rational- actor approaches to human behavior.
