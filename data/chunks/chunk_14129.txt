 Notably, the occurrence of BCP decreased from pH 9 to pH 3, where other TPs arising from C–O and C–S bond cleavages were detected. This pathway shift was also reflected by isotope data, with a more pronounced change in carbon isotope ratios (Δδ13C(end – initial) = +1.3 ‰) at the end of the hydrolysis at pH 3. These results are consistent, albeit with lower magnitudes, with the abiotic hydrolysis of parathion OP, where εC ranged from − 6.9 ± 0.8 ‰ at pH 2 to − 3.5 ± 0.4 ‰ at pH 9, and to the absence of isotope fractionation at pH 12 [16].

However, stable isotope fractionation was not pH-dependent, with εC ranging consistently from −1.9 to −2.0 ‰ across the pH range of 3–9 (Table 1). Under simulated sunlight, where degradation was limited to less than 50 %, no significant isotope fractionation was detected. Four degradation products were consistently detected during the UV photolysis experiments across all pH conditions. Similar TPs were identified in the simulated sunlight experiment, though in smaller proportions due to the limited extent of dissipation (< 50 %). Structural and mass spectral similarities with previously reported findings [44,50], suggest that the two primary degradation products resulted from C—Br bond cleavage (pathways 2 and 3). Additionally, BCP (pathway 1) and another TP (pathway 5), formed through C—O bond cleavage, were detected in smaller amounts. These observations align with earlier studies, which also identified the simultaneous presence of BCP and thiophosphoric acids resulting from C–Br bond cleavage under similar UV light conditions [44,45]. The analysis of TPs and the apparent kinetic isotope effect (AKIE) values suggested the simultaneous occurrence of two degradation pathways, yielding an average AKIE of 1.021–1.022. This is consistent with isotope fractionations associated with low isotope effect (hydro­ lysis, KIE ⁓ 1.000) for O–P bond cleavage and higher isotope effects (KIE = 1.042) for C–Br bond cleavage. For comparison, the OP insecti­ cide dimethoate exhibited εC = − 3.7 ± 1.1 ‰ (AKIE = 1.009 – 1.019) during direct photolysis, involving C–O bond cleavage [56]. 3.3.4. Soil dissipation In the biotic soil dissipation experiments, profenofos TPs were detected less frequently, with maximum detection representing only 10–20 % of the initially applied profenofos, based on HPLC-MS-MS peak area ratios (TPmax/Profenofosinitial). Among the detected TPs, only BCP and TP2 were observed, suggesting the concurrent occurrence of O–P and C–Br bond cleavages. Notably, BCP was also significantly detected in the heat-treated soil dissipation experiment, confirming the potential for degradation by heat-resistant microorganisms or hydrolysis on mineral surfaces [26].
