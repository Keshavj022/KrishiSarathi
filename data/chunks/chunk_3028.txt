‐3 was found to give maximum yield consistently for four years. Calocybe indica fruited best on wheat straw. Wheat straw sterilized with steam or in hot water was suitable for the growth of C. indica. Out of seven strains of V. volvacea (VV1‐VV7) evaluated for mushroom yield, strain VV4 showed early fruiting and better biological efficiency under natural climatic conditions of Punjab. Paddy straw compost gave superior mushroom yield than cotton waste compost during the cultivation of Volvariella volvacea. Five different bed designs – hollow bed, compact bed (square), compact bed (round), hollow bundles (4x5+2) and compact bundles (5x4+2) were tried. Compact bed (round) gave highest mushroom yield along with early pinning. Out of four substrates tried namely, wheat straw, paddy straw, maize stalks/leaves and corn cobs, wheat straw was the most suitable for the cultivation of A. polytricha. Later on, supplementation of wheat straw with wheat bran @ 4% further improved the yield potential on steam sterilization of the substrate before inoculation of spawn. Post Harvest Technology: Mushrooms were dipped for 10 minutes in EDTA (75, 100, 125, 150, 200, 500 ppm), EDTA 100 ppm + KMS (0.02%) and KMS (0.05%) and stored at room temperature and in the refrigerator. The observations made after 48h indicated that A. bisporus U3 strain was at its best when treated with EDTA 100 ppm + KMS (0.02%) and EDTA 500 ppm stored in the refrigerator but the same was not true for the S11 strain. Mushrooms were harvested, washed with 0.05% KMS and packed in 75, 100, 125 gauge PP bags and 100 gauge PE bags as control. The bags were kept at RT (22 ± 2oC) and in the refrigerator (5oC) for 48h. .At room temperature, at 0h all mushrooms were white (3+) but after 24h, mushrooms in 100 PP and 125 PP maintained superior whiteness. After 48h, mushrooms in 125 PP bag were better to show highest whiteness with no weight loss. At refrigerated conditions, maximum whiteness of mushrooms was observed even after 24h in 75PP, 100PP and 125 PP bags but after 48h whiteness was best (+3) in mushrooms packed in 125 PP bags with no significant weight loss and veil opening. Pleurotus florida fruiting bodies were blanched (dipped in boiling 0.2% NaCl + 0.1% Citric Acid solution for 2 min) and unblanched (washed with 0.2% NaCl + 0.1% Citric Acid for 2 min) and compared with unwashed fruiting bodies. The mushrooms were subjected to sun drying and cabinet drying (60oC till 7‐ 8% moisture using Kilburn oven Model 12E WQ148, Macnill & Macor Ltd, Calcutta). Whiteness was best (+4) when blanched mushrooms were sun dried/cabinet dried and stored upto 3 months. After 3 months, brittleness was maximum (+4) for sun dried blanched/unblanched mushrooms. For Pleurotus florida, best keeping quality was observed when sun dried unblanched mushrooms were stored. In all set of treatments, dried mushrooms showed no incidence of any disease/pest/off flavour.
