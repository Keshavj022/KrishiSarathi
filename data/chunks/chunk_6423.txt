 Hisar, Hyderabad, Parbhani and Coimbatore exist in India, suggesting that sorghum and maize genotypes need to be tested against these populations to identify stable sources of resistance. The first ever whole genome sequencing of C. partellus was carried out with genome size â‰ˆ 332.2 Mb, which will help to identify and knockdown functional diapausing genes. Amphiphilic polymer based controlled release formulation of chlorantraniliprole: Functionalized amphiphilic polymers based on poly (ethylene glycols) (PEGs, molecular weight of 600, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000) and dimethyl 5-hydroxyisophthalate followed by O-alkylation with bromohexane and bromooctadecane ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 75 CROP MANAGEMENT were synthesized. Controlled release (CR) formulations of chlorantraniliprole (CAP) were developed by encapsulating it in functionalized amphiphilic polymer. Release kinetics study suggested that maximum amount of CAP was released on 35th day for formulation 7d, 28th day from 6d and 7c, 21st day from 6c and 7b, 15th day from 6b and 7a and 10th day from 6a than 3rd day from the commercial formulation Coragen 18.5% SC. The t1/2 of CAP release from the developed formulations ranged from 7.2-18.1 days in water while it was 1.9 days from Coragen 18.5% SC. All the developed CRFs were evaluated. In-vitro bioassay for insecticidal activity against Spodoptera frugiperda (Fall armyworm) revealed that CRF 6b formulation showed highest activity with LC50 value of 0.069 ppm and performed better than the commercial formulation Coragen 18.5% SC (LC50 = 0.072 ppm). Bio-intensive integrated pest management in groundnut: Insect pests and diseases of groundnut can be managed with the combined practices involving (1) Border crop with 4 rows of jowar; (2) use of resistant/ tolerant variety; (3) Seed treatment with Trichoderma asperellum @ 10 g/kg seed; (4) Basal application of FYM (250 kg) based T. asperellum @ 4 kg/ha and Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 4 kg/ha at 30 DAS; (5) Foliar application of neem seed kernel extract (2 %) at 20, 40, 60 and 80 DAS; (6) Foliar application of Metarhizium rileyi @ 1 kg/ha at 30 DAS; (7) Need based foliar application of 10 % aqueous leaf extracts of Ocimum lawsonia and Neem at 40, 50 and 60 DAS respectively; (8) Erection of pheromone traps for Spodoptera, Helicoverpa separately @ 10 no./ha and leaf miner @ 20 no./ha ; (9) Erection of Blue and yellow sticky traps @ 25 /ha; (10) Trap crops, viz. castor and cowpea and marigold. This practice was recommended for kharif season crop of groundnut in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. There was reduction in incidence of Late leaf spot by 20%; Soil-borne diseases by 15-47%; Thrips by 18%, Helicoverpa by 32% and Spodoptera by 27%, along with increase in pod yield from 9-37%, and ICBR of 1.4-2.1. Deciphering of pod borer resistance in wild pigeon pea, Cajanus platycarpus: Pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera) is the most damaging pest of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan).
