This unexpected finding may be due to specific levels of education, such as having no education or only primary education, which can result in lower tech­ nical efficiency and difficulties in decision-making regarding the prior­ itization of irrigation technologies (Degfe et al., 2023). The caste variable showed a positive sign in the Model 2 and 3 groups of OBC and the general category, indicating a higher rate of adoption of SI and D&SI compared to the SC & ST group (Chand et al., 2020), which had a negative and significant effect on the probability of low adoption of MI technologies due to higher maintenance costs and hardware issues (Patil et al., 2019). The analysis of marginal effects reveals the influence of education on the adoption of irrigation technologies. According to the research, farmers with little or no formal education have lower adoption rates of both drip irrigation (3.0–4.0%) and sprinkler irrigation (4.0–4.2%) compared to those with higher levels of education. However, when both irrigation systems are considered together, the adoption rate increases significantly to 5.0–6.0%. This indicates that education levels play a crucial role in promoting the adoption of irrigation technologies. The positive marginal effects observed for graduate education under drip irrigation support the notion that higher education levels contribute to increased adoption rates, as indicated by NCAP (2019). This finding is in line with Gilg and Barr’s (2006) research, which highlights the benefi­ cial impact of education on promoting water-saving behavior. The economic and natural capital parameters of household income, orchard size, landholding size, and source of irrigation were all found to be statistically significant and positively correlated in all three models. In particular, higher farm income plays a vital role and can provide strong motivation for farmers to invest in and adopt MI technologies compared to farmers with minimal income. Larger farm household in­ comes strongly motivate farmers to invest in and adopt MI technologies compared to those with smaller holdings. However, households actively engaged in non-farm activities, especially if they become the primary income source, may hinder the adoption of modern technology among farmers.
