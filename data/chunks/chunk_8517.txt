 A single plant selection of Pisang Awak with a yield potential of 15–20% more yield than local, having field resistance to nematodes and Sigatoka leaf spot diseases has been identified. This is a dual purpose variety with excellent dessert and cooking quality. Banana Gold Finger was highly resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot. A promising triploid hybrid, H 212 (ABB) (Karpooravalli × Pisang Lilin) was found superior to Ney Poovan (AB) in yield, quality and tolerance to nematodes. Application of distillery sludge 2.5 kg + 1 kg vermicompost + 1 kg neem cake + 2.5 kg poultry manure per plant showed maximum growth in Rasthali and Karpooravalli. It has significantly suppressed the population of root-lesion nematode, root-knot nematode and spiral nematode besides checking the Sigatoka leaf spot disease. Application of gypsum (2 kg/plant) + FYM (15 kg/plant) + 120% K is recommended for optimum yield of banana in saline sodic soil. Additional profit of Rs 34,250/ha in Poovan banana may be taken by application of 15 kg rice husk ash or 15 kg poultry manure per plant, thereby saving 20% inorganic fertilizers. Application of N and K2O in 4–7 split doses recorded highest bunch weight and yield/ha in banana. Plant spacing of 1.2 m × 1.2 m × 2 m for Rasthali was found ideal to get highest yield. Application of 300 : 90 : 300 g, N : P2O5 : K2O/plant/year for Gandevi selection recorded highest bunch weight (27.66 kg) and yield (85.35 tonnes/ha). Application of 200 and 150 g N/plant/year in vegetative and reproductive phase respectively was found ideal for Rasthali. Intercropping cowpea was found effective to control weeds in Palayankodan banana under Kannara conditions. Fertigation of 25 litres/day with 200 : 30 : 300 g/plant/year N : P : K recorded higher yield in first ratoon crop. Foliar application of CCC (1000 ppm) 4 and 6 months after planting in Robusta recorded higher bunch weight (24.1 kg) and number of fingers (1,245) under Coimbatore conditions. Sucker treatment by Monocrotophos (14 ml/litre) followed by soil application of Carbofuran (60 g) 4 and 7 months after planting protected the plants from corm weevil infestation. Swabbing of Chlorpyrifos (0.06%) over pseudostem 5 months after planting provides effective control of banana stem weevil infestation. Entomopathogenic nematode was effective in killing the stem weevil grub. Endophytic fungi, Fusarium spp., is recommended as an effective biocontrol agent for controlling nematodes. Prophylactic spraying of 0.1% Carbendazim or 0.1% Propiconazole on peduncle immediately after shoot emergence and covering it with dried banana leaves to avoid exposure to sun completely controls the occurrence of peduncle rot of banana. Application of Trichoderma viride @10 g/plant 4 times (at the time of planting and 3, 5 and 6 months after planting) controlled Fusarium wilt in banana. Trichoderma spp. could be multiplied on mass scale in the dried banana leaves within 4 days.
