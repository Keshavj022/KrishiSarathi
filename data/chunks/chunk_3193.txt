Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): • AINP on Pesticide Residues has conducted a number of supervised field trials for the evaluation of safe waiting period and pre harvest interval for pesticide spray on important crops grown in different agro‐climatic zones of the country. The residue data generated is also used for the risk assessment and fixation of MRL of pesticides on different crops. • The persistence/dissipation of Spiromesifen was studied on a chilli, cotton, apple, tea and brinjal. Supervised field trial of spiromesifen was carried out at three centers YSPUH&F, Solan; PAU, Ludhiana and ANGRAU, Hyderabad. With each crop the trial was conducted at four locations and two dosages i.e. recommended and double the recommended dose of application (96 and 192 g a.i. ha‐1). The half‐life of Spiromesifen was found to be 5.0‐8.5 days in the tea leaves. The residues of Spiromesifen on brinjal fruits and soil were found non‐detectable on the 15th day of application at all the locations at both the dosages. The half life on chilli was found 2‐2.5 days. In the chilli field soil no residues were detectable at harvest. Residues of Spiromesifen in cotton lint, seed and soil at the time of first picking were below detectable at all three locations. • Supervised trial of Mancozeb75 % WP on cumin was carried out at four centers viz. Anand, Kalyani, Jaipur and Hyderabad at two dosages i.e. 1125 g a.i. /ha and 2250 g a.i./ha The mancozeb residues at harvest in cumin seeds were below its MRL of 3.
