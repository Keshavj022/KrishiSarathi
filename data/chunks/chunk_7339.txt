 In view of this, an agreement called as Budapest Treaty was passed in 1977 for deposition of microorganisms in culture collection centres for the purposes of patent procedure. NAIMCC is the third IDA of the country after Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC), Chandigarh and National Centre for Microbial Resources (NCMR), Pune. As IDA, NAIMCC will be entrusted to conserve microorganisms used to develop patents. NAIMCC, a designated microbial repository for agriculturally important microorganisms (AIMs) under the National Biodiversity Act, 2002, is an affiliate member of World Federation of Culture Collections (WFCC), and registered with the World Data Centre for Microorganisms (WDCM registration number 1060). GENETIC RESOURCES ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 25 for augmenting the breeding programmes. Seed spices: A total of 86 new germplasm lines (50 in coriander, five in fenugreek, four in fennel, 15 in ajwain, 10 in kasuri methi and one each in cumin and nigella) were collected from Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Medicinal plants: A total of 16 germplasm accessions of madhunashinee (Gymnema sylvestre) were collected from the Western Ghats of Maharashtra. Mushrooms: A total of 236 specimen strains of different mushrooms were collected from 26 states of the country. seedling population. It has deep pink fruit (22.56 g weight), 21.59 °Brix and high anthocyanin (96.56 mg/ 100 g) in peel. NRCL-88 has 16.22 g fruit weight, 76.38% pulp with small seed (7.63%). Vegetable crops Characterization of cow pea germplasm for micronutrient content in pods: There was a large variation in cowpea genotypes with respect to micronutrients contents in the pods. Copper contents ranged from 3.2 ppm in VRCP-112-4 to 14.45 ppm in VRCP-96-4, iron from 79 ppm in VRCP 71-1 to 229.6 ppm in VRCP 167-3, zinc from 51.45 ppm in VRCP 158-3 to 98.25 ppm in Kashi Shyamal; and manganese from 40.1 ppm in VRCP to 112.4 to 67.3 ppm in Kashi Unnati. Onion Two promising red onion lines identified: DOGR- 1627 has medium red with globe shape bulbs weighing 67.4 g with thin neck and almost free from double bulbs and bolters. It has 27% more (34.62 t/ha) marketable bulb yield than check Bhima Super (27.25 t/ha). The line is early in maturity and harvested within 95 days after transplanting during kharif. Garcinia (Garcinia andamanica) collected from Andaman and Nicobar islands A unique black pepper accession with extra-long spike (34.5 cm) was collected from the Madikeri, Karnataka  Wild mushroom Cantharellus sp. Other strains of wild mushrooms Characterization and identification of germplasm Fruit crops Litchi: Two promising genetic stocks of litchi were identified. NRCL-59 is selection from open pollinated NRCL-59 NRCL-88 DOGR-1639 has medium red with flat-globe shaped bulbs with thin neck, weighing 62.8 g, free from doubles and bolters during rabi. It produces 37% more (36.81 t/ha) marketable bulb yield than check Bhima Kiran (26.83 t/ha).
