 In situ management significantly influences moisture content, bulk density, porosity, aggregate stability, pH, cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, and nutrient content, which are crucial for sustainable agricultural practices. The Government of India through ICAR institutes, SAUs, KVK system introduced crop residue management project to popularize the proficient machines like happy seeder, super seeder, and zero till seed drill for in-situ residue management and conservation tillage for improving soil health 2018 onwards. The outcomes of the project have been very encouraging including enhanced crop yields and cost-effectiveness, reinforcing the importance of in-situ residue management for sustainable agriculture. This exploration aims to inform stakeholders, policymakers, and researchers, fostering a collective effort towards harmonious coexistence between agricultural productivity and soil health in rice cultivation. Keywords: Burning, Crop nutrients, Crop residue, Mechanization, Soil health ICE is the predominant crop of India with over 44 million ha area and more than 130 million tonnes annual production. The dwarf varieties of rice are characterized by the accumulation of substantial amounts of biomass, which after harvest as crop residue presents a challenge that extends beyond the fields. The management of rice residue has emerged as a critical facet in the quest for sustainable agriculture, particularly in the context of in-situ practices. According to estimates about 300 million tonnes of crop residue is produced annually in rice-wheat cropping system in India. Rice residue, comprised of straw and remnants left after harvesting, has historically been viewed as a by- product, often disposed of through burning or other conventional methods. The conventional approach, while providing a quick solution for field clearing, has raised environmental concerns, contributing to air pollution, nutrient loss, and alterations in soil parameters. In response to these challenges, the paradigm is shifting towards the in-situ management of rice residue as Indian Farming a strategic avenue for promoting both agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition that rice residue, far from being a waste material, holds untapped potential as a valuable resource for the enhancement of soil health. The shift towards in situ management entails practices like surface mulching or incorporating residue into the soil, aiming to maximize the positive impacts on soil structure, nutrient content, and overall sustainability. However, understanding the nuanced effects of these practices on soil health is essential to strike the delicate balance between agricultural productivity and environmental preservation.
