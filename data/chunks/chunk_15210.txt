 Further, in soils with higher organic matter and soil carbon, organic farmers proﬁted more than in other areas. In the regression analysis, in addition to the total sample, a sub-sample of rainfed and the hilly regions was considered to run a separate regression. The results conﬁrm the tabular analysis. In the case of irrigated farmers, the yield decrease Sustainability 2022, 14, 15057 13 of 22 was more severe. Further, in the hilly areas, soils are rich with organic matter and soil carbon; hence, organic farming is sustainable and proﬁtable. 3.7. Impact of PKVY at the Macro Level At the farmer level, the impact of the adoption of organic agriculture was positive in terms of proﬁtability and reduction in cost, even though there was a reduction in the yield in all crops. However, at the macro level, the decrease in production may raise food insecurity if area under organic agriculture is expanded beyond a threshold level. Hence, in this section, we employed the economic surplus model to determine the impact of adopting organic agriculture at the national level (overall) as well as whether adoption was conﬁned to rainfed, hilly and tribal areas only [35]. The economic surplus model was applied in two scenarios with 10% of the area converted from conventional to organic farming and another with 30% converted to organic agriculture. In addition, a third and fourth scenario of conversion was conﬁned to only in rainfed, hilly and tribal areas by the same area. The economic surplus model shows that if organic agriculture is adopted on 10% and 30% of the overall cropped area under each crop, there is a likely increased food deﬁcit in all the three crops, wheat, paddy and soybean due to a decrease in production (Tables 3–5). The reduction in yields and consequent reduction in production leads to a food shortage for consumption, which may lead to food insecurity. There is a likely reduction in economic surplus, both producer and consumer surplus (Table 4). However, the loss is less than 5% of the total value of production in a paddy and about 3% in soybean and wheat, even if there is a 30% area conversion to organic farming. The marginal loss of up to 5% can be recovered by enhancing the price premium through exporting branded and certiﬁed organic produce in the future. Table 4.
