Village cooperatives and self-help groups can be lever­ aged to support women’s access to agricultural information and adoption of CSA practices. SIGNIFICANCE: This paper highlights constraints to information and extension access by Indian women farmers that could impede the widespread adoption of CSA practices. It fills an important knowledge gap in designing gender-responsive policies and inclusive agricultural extension systems to promote adoption of CSA practices among smallholder farmers. 1. Introduction Indian agriculture depends on the monsoon season, which typically lasts from June through September. Over 50% of India’s net sown area is rainfed and around 78% of India’s rainfall is received during the monsoon season (Deshpande, 2022; Picciariello et al., 2021; GoI., 2018; Kim and UN.ESCAP, 2012). Climate change has had a direct impact on the onset of India’s monsoons, especially around the country’s central and northern parts (IPCC, 2022; Datta et al., 2022; GoI., 2018). This delay often forces significant shifts in farming practices, delaying sowing for the Kharif (monsoon) crop, key for the country’s food security (Shagun, 2023; Singh et al., 2020). A delayed monsoon onset does not necessarily translate into a reduction in net rainfall. Rainfall patterns are concentrated in July and August (IPCC, 2022; World Bank, 2013), when heavy showers could adversely affect standing crops. Concentrated precipitation events lead to inundation and an increased incidence and variety of pests and pathogens, resulting in increased pesticide applications (International Food Policy Research Institute, 2022; Goswami, 2017). Thus, abiotic climate stresses such as drought, heat, salinity, and inundation affect biotic stresses such as pathogens, insects, and weeds. The impact of climate change on agriculture is spread through the entire cropping cycle. Prolonged dry periods reduce soil moisture, affecting seed germination and viability, in turn affecting yield poten­ tial. Farmers able to invest in irrigation can overcome this if they can access water resources, while small and marginal farmers adjust by compromising on crop yield and quality (Datta et al., 2022). Changes in farming practices to combat climate change impacts on agriculture tend to add significant pressure to the agricultural ecosystem.
