 Why drought management? Incidence of drought affects households and economies depending on the severity and extent of incidence. In India, though macro-level impacts are being increasingly better addressed, droughts continue to adversely affect household economies. The risk associated with drought for any region is the exposure to the natural hazard and the vulnerability of the society to its incidence. As incidence of drought is external to any economic activity, we can only implement strategies to reduce its impact. However, it is critically important for scientists to understand and communicate the probability of drought events. In general, a greater understanding of the natural hazard and human exposure to this climatic extreme and a better awareness of the micro and macro context of peopleâ€™s sensitivity to drought are important considerations in drought risk assessment. This knowledge will enable the identification and implementation of improved drought mitigation, readiness, and response strategies to build a more robust society to future droughts. Drought management Drought preparedness: The knowledge and capacities developed by governments, response and recovery organizations, communities and individuals to effectively anticipate, respond to and recover from the impacts of likely, imminent or current droughts. Drought preparedness is crucial with increasing climate variabilities. The key areas that need to be in place are firstly to have an early warning system which is effective and timely, and it should be backed by remote sensing and GIS tools for monitoring drought conditions like soil moisture followed by Probability of drought incidence (Source: Rao et al. 2019) Table 1.

Adoption of various soil and water conservation technologies, rainwater harvesting methods is an important element of preparedness. Farm level diversification in the form of agroforestry, integrated farming systems, etc. help smoothen income fluctuations. Community- based approaches like capacity building and training programs for participatory preparedness involving local farmers to identify context-specific drought strategies. The contingency plans are useful for preparedness and coping drought impacts.
