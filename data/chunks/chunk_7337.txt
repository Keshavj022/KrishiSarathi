 Diploid wild potato species with wider genetic base IC0635059 20074 Highly resistant to late blight disease. Diploid wild potato species with wider genetic base Cotton (Gossypium spp.) IC0626294 20076 CISG 20 (GMS) is a spontaneous mutant identified from agronomically adapted line CISA 20 maintained by sib mating. One among few GMS lines available in diploid would serve as additional resource for hybrid development program in diploid cotton. The line CISG20 (GMS) has open red flower which facilitates easy crossing; red flower, red petal spot and red plant body characters shall be used as marker characters Sunflower IC0628528 20078 Resistant to powdery mildew (PDS<10%) (Helianthus annuus) (Concluded...) Crop National INGR Novel unique features GENETIC RESOURCES ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 24 Microbial genetic resources: The National Agriculturally Important Microbial Culture Collection (NAIMCC), designated as national repository for agriculturally important microorganisms by the National Biodiversity Authority under the National Biodiversity Act, 2002 was conferred the status of International Depositary Authority (IDA) under the Budapest Treaty by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 2020. At present, the total number of holdings in NAIMCC is 6,907 (bacteria 2,595, fungi 3,981, cyanobacteria 331). During the period under report, 107 agriculturally important microbial cultures were accessioned which includes 48 bacteria, 20 fungi and 39 cyanobacteria. Some of the bacteria of rare occurrence like Chromobacterium violaceum, Thiobacillus, Kaistobacter, Devosia, Rhodoplanes, Marinobacter, Geobacter, Oceanobacillus, Kurthia, Halobacterium, Clavobacterium, Grimontia, Ochrobactrum pseudogrignonense were added to the culture collection. Forty-two microbial cultures used in agricultural and in particular as biopesticides were deposited by public and private institutions under safe deposit. About 75 cultures were supplied to both academia and industry. HORTICULTURE Collection/augmentation of germplasm Exotic sources Tomato: Four genotypes of tomato were introduced from AVRDC, The World Vegetable Centre, Taiwan. Potato: A total of 34 accessions of potato were imported from various countries including 15 diploids from the US potato gene bank, 3 from the Peru, 15 from Ireland and one from Denmark.
