 The clear mixture is ready for use. Then 1 litre of this mixture is added to 1 litre water, which is sprayed either by using hand-sprayer or by power sprayer. When tomato seedling is 15 days old, this mixture can be sprayed at frequent intervals until harvest. For 1 acre land, 10 litres of this solution is recommended. Control of root rot and damping will result in good yield. It is best suited only for tomato PKM 1 in Thaipattam (January). : Shri P.

METHODOLOGY The study was conducted at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore and Indian Institute of Horticultural Research, Bangalore. Experiment Field experiment was conducted during 2002- 03,2003-04 and 2004-05 with 3 treatments, viz. (i) Cynodon dactylon extract spray, (ii) endosulfan Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE 35 EC 0.07% spray, and (iii) untreated check. Tomato (variety PKM 1) was raised in 45 m2 plots in 8 replications. Incidence of pest and yield were recorded. Preparation of Cynodon decoction Fresh leaves of Cynodon were sun dried and powdered. Then 2 kg powder is mixed with 10 litres water in a mud pot and is left for 24 hr. Filtrate obtained is diluted with equal quantity of water and sprayed at 15 days interval until harvest. Replications: Eight Date of sowing: 10 April 2004 Date of transplanting: 17 May 2004 Date of spray: 2 July, 16 July and 2 Aug 2004 The transplanting was delayed for 10 days due to continuous rain and hence the farmers were not able to prepare the land. Date of harvest: 30 August 2004 1. The observations recorded were pre- and post-treatment counts of the larvae per 20 plants on 20 DAT (days after transplanting) and fruit damage, incidence of wilt, leaf curl and fruit rot at 10 days interval from 45 days after transplanting and yield per plot (kg). Apart from this, laboratory experimentation was also done. Observations were recorded on the number of larvae of Helicoverpa armigera/20 plants, fruit damage, incidence of wilt, leaf curl and fruit-rot diseases. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Data on laboratory experiment presented in Table 1 show that Cynodon extract spray at 7.5 Table 1.
