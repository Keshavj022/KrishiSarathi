, 2022; Zizinga et al., 2022). In India, where agriculture is the backbone of the rural economy, climate-related stresses (e.g., erratic precipitation, pest infestations, and extreme weather events) significantly impact agricultural stability (Dagar et al., 2012; Dar et al., 2020a; Singh et al., 2021). The nation’s diverse climate, while supporting a wide range of crops, also heightens the threat to essential staples like wheat and rice. Projections of a 2.8 ◦C temperature increase by 2050 highlight the urgent need for robust climate-resilient agriculture (CRA) strategies across various agro-climatic zones in India (Srivastav et al., 2021; Birthal et al., 2021; * Corresponding author. ** Corresponding author.

By integrating traditional knowledge and modern techniques, CRA can provide a promising pathway to improve productivity, resilience, and carbon sequestration (Birthal et al., 2021; Singha et al., 2024; Angom and Viswanathan, 2023; Goswami et al., 2023; Shiiba, 2022). Global case studies demonstrate the CRA’s efficacy in improving food security and water management (Sekaran et al., 2021). For example, Kim et al. (2019) applied generalized linear models (GLMs) in South Korea to study the impact of land cover on flooding, emphasizing the role of farmer-maintained irrigation systems informed by traditional ecological knowledge. Similarly, Ha et al. (2020) employed dynamic modeling to assess climate-resilient livelihoods for smallholder farmers in Vietnam, while Shahzad et al. (2021) explored the development of stress-responsive plant transcription factors for cultivating climate-resilient crops globally. Studies by Schiavon et al. (2021) and Antwi-Agyei et al. (2021) further showed sustainable farming practices over Europe and Africa, respectively, highlighting CRA’s global appli- cability. Galappaththi et al. (2020) investigated stress-responsive tran- scription factors in cultivating crops capable of withstanding biotic and abiotic stress. Likewise, Mpanga et al. (2021) analyzed sustainable food production among small-scale farmers in north-central Arizona, noting an increase in farm numbers but a decline in average farm size due to population growth and challenging climate conditions from 1997 to 2017.
