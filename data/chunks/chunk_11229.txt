 Varieties and hybrids: Improved American cotton varieties: HS-6, H-1117, H-1126, H-1098 Improved, H-1236, H-1300 Recommended improved hybrids- HHH-223, HHH-287 Desi Cotton varieties- HD-107, HD-123, HD-324, HD-432 Desi Cotton hybrid â€“ AAH-1 Note: Farmers can cultivate improved BT cotton hybrids suitable for specific conditions developed by various International companies. Seed Treatment and Seed Soaking yy Before sowing, seed should be dipped in water up to 5-6 hours for better germination. yy Treat the seed with 5 gm Emisan, 1 gm streptocyclin and 1 gm succinic acid in 10 litres of water. yy In termite affected areas treat the seed with 10 ml chlorpyriphos apart from above mentioned chemicals. yy Seed treatment with carbendazim @ 2 gm /kg in the root rot affected areas is essential. yy Seed treatment with Imidacloprid @ 7.5 gm / kg seed to escape the crops from sucking pests up to 40-60 days. 58 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS Seed rate: Use 15-20 kg delinted seed of improved American cotton varieties for sowing in one ha area. 12.5 kg of seed /ha is required for Desi cotton varieties. Seed rate of 3-3.750 kg /ha is required for American cotton hybrids and desi cotton hybrids. Seed rate of 2.125 kg/ha is required for BT Cotton hybrids. Method of Sowing Sow the crop in lines 67.5 cm apart with a cotton sowing drill or cotton planter and plant to plant spacing of 60 cm or row to row spacing of 100cm and plant to plant spacing of 45 cm. Sowing should be done at a depth of 4-5 cm. Fertilizer use For obtaining high yield in cotton, 80-100 Kg N per ha for American Cotton and 50 kg N for desi cotton along with 30 kg P2O5/ha and in case of hybrid cotton, 150 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, 60 kg K2Oand 25 kg ZnSo4per ha has been recommended. Apply 1/3 dose of N, full dose of P2O5, full dose of potash and full dose of ZnSo4 at time of sowing. Remaining dose of N should be applied in two equal splits at square formation and flowering stage. However, the nitrogenous fertilizer application, half quantity at squaring and half at flowering gave highest seed cotton yields. In case of hybrid split the N dose in three parts i.e., sowing, squaring and flowering stage. In sandy soil the research results have revealed that 90 per cent dose of fertilizer through soil application and 10 per cent through foliar spray at the boll development stage gave the highest seed cotton yield. Inoculation of cotton seed with C2, M4 and Azospirillumculture resulted into saving of 25-27 kg N/ha. Summer Moong: yy If infestation of Jassid and white fly is observed, apply 1.0 litre malathion 50 EC or 625 dimethioate 30 EC per hectare in 625 litres of water. 59 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy Harvest the crop at ripening of 70-80 % pods to allow timely sowing of the kharif crop. Sorghum To provide palatable and nutritious fodder to milch animals, preference should be given to cultivation of sorghum as fodder crop. Improved Varieties: SSG-59-3, HC-136, HC-171, HC-308, HG-541.
