CENTRES OF ADVANCED STUDIES Centres of Advanced Studies (CAS) scheme was launched to improve the quality of teaching in State Agricultural Universities. (SAUs) and Deemed Universities (DUs) of ICAR. The objective of the scheme is to identify the major discipline in SAUs/DUs which have developed facilities and faculty in the area of specialization and to make them capable of imparting advanced training to faculties of other SAUs/ institutes to enhance their teaching and research capabilities. As per recommendations of QRT, steps are being taken to open new CAS in Plant Biotechnology, Animal Biotechnology, Pharmacology, Veterinary Pathology and International Agriculture Trade and Marketing. During the year 2001â€“02, 72 trainings were organized in which 1,278 scientists from various institutions in different disciplines were trained and 72 manuals were prepared. Some of the Summer School Training Course on Advanced Plant Molecular Biology Techniques conducted by CAS in Biochemistry, at IARI, New Delhi AGRICULTURAL HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT 157 important areas of the trainings conducted are as follows: l Multimedia in teaching of clinical medicine and therapeutics. l Watershed management as an approach towards efficient resource use. l Breeding heterosis and disease resistance of commercial vegetable crops. l Emerging trends in functional foods. l Brood stock management and genetic selection in fish seed production. l Microbial transformations in soil. l Demand-supply projections of agricultural commodities. l Designing vortals for NARS. l Social sciences in agro-biological research. l Preservation of Ghee and fat rich dairy products. l Diseases of wild life and their management.
