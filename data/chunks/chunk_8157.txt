 Sixty two in vegetable crops (tomato, brinjal, okra, cabbage, cauliflower, onion, french bean, Indian bean, radish, kale, chilli, winged bean, pointed gourd, bottlegourd, cucumber, chenopod, pumpkin, sponge gourd, garden pea, round melon etc.,), two in fruit crops (mango, papaya) and twenty two in spices and tubers (cadamom, potato, cassava, ginger, corinder etc.,) Guava Arka Poorna: The Arka Poorna guava variety has been identified for release. This variety is from the progeny selection of Purple Local × Allahabad Safeda cross. Plants are semi-vigorous in growth habit with prolific bearing and hence suitable for medium to high density planting. Fruits are round, medium to big in size (200–230 g) with smooth, and shiny pericarp. Pulp is firm, white with thick outer rind, good flavour, TSS (10–12°B), ascorbic acid (190–198 mg/100 g), medium soft seeds (10 to 12 kg/cm2) and good keeping quality. It is a dual-purpose variety suitable for both table purpose and processing. Banana NRCB Selection 11 (Manoranjitham variant) performance in hills of Tamil Nadu: Manoranjitham (AAA) is a unique variety with an excellent aromatic and fragrant pulp from Kolli Hills of Tamil Nadu. A high-yielding somaclonal variant with 300% high yield over the parent. Comparative evaluation of ICAR- NRCB Selection 11 (Manoranjitham variant) in plains and hills indicated that the performance was better at higher elevations above 1,500 m above MSL.

Livestock Improvement DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2018–19 59 Cattle Holstein-Sahiwal crossbreds: The total population of Frieswal females at 25 Military Farms located in various agro-climatic regions of the country was 20,673 including 992 elite Frieswal cows during the reporting year. During the period, 235 Frieswal bulls were maintained at the bull rearing unit. The overall mean age at first calving was 967.24 days (31.82 months). The overall means of 300 days milk yield, total milk yield, peak yield (PY) and lactation length were 3,340.26, 3,358.86, 14.91 kg and 322.09 days, respectively. The least squares means of service period (SP), dry period (DP) and calving interval (CI) were 162.52, 116.98 and 433.05 days, respectively. Improvement through selection in indigenous breeds: The programme covers Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal breeds. Gir (24), Kankrej (26) and Sahiwal bulls (25) in three sets were inducted for progeny testing. The total number of inseminations carried out in Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal units were 2,793, 2,417 and 1,174 with the conception percentages of 43.54, 46.21 and 44.80, respectively. Since the inception of the project, 5,112 Gir, 1,957 Kankrej and 1,326 Sahiwal daughters were born. The average age at first calving in Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal were 1,409.00, 1,195.21 and 1,114.32 days, respectively. The average first lactation 305-day or less milk yield, first lactation length and first peak yield were 2,344.5 kg, 410.9 days and 13.3 kg in Gir; 2,241.
