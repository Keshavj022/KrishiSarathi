 Management of potato tuber moth in stores using biological control agents: Tuber dip treatment with Bacillus thuringiensis formulation @ 2% for 20 min is recommended for management of potato tuber moth under ambient storage condition of Maharashtra and Karnataka. Disease management and diagnostics Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) resistant diploid bananas: Diploid banana germplasm accessions (AA and BB) were screened for resistance against BBTV using viruliferous aphids in an insect proof screen house. Thirteen AA diploids expressed typical symptoms of bunchy top viral infection, but BB diploids did not show symptoms except one accession. The time taken to express the symptoms varied between 30 and 120 days. The control (susceptible triploid) varieties, viz. Virupakshi (Hill banana) and Grand Naine, expressed BBTV symptoms within 30 days of inoculation. Some of the Musa species like M. flaviflora and M. burmannicoides were also observed to be susceptible to BBTV. Reaction of diploid banana accessions to BBTV inoculation. (Left: BB genotypes, and Right: AA diploids expressing typical bunchy top symptoms) CROP MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 75 (Acephate @ 1.5 g/l + neem oil @ 2 ml/l) + (Fipronil @ 1.0 ml/l + neem oil @ 2 ml/l) + (imidacloprid @ 2 g/151 + neem oil @ 2 ml/l) + (Cyzpyr @ 1.8 ml/l) at 7 days interval till fruit formation significantly reduced the incidence of vector-borne viral diseases in chilli. Residual analysis of pesticides used in the best treatment indicated that the acephate @ 1.5 g/l, fipronil @1.0 ml/l imidacloprid @ 2 g/15 l and cyzpyr @ 1.8 ml/l were not detected in HPLC/GLC testing. The CB ratio varied from 1:1.92 to 1:3.07. Management of late blight in potato: Following spray recommendation were made for management of late blight in potato in different agro-climatic conditions. Prophylactic spray with mancozeb @ 0.25% followed by cymoxanil + mancozeb @ 0.3% at the time of disease appearance and one more spray with mancozeb @ 0.25% after 8–10 days of second spray in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Prophylactic spray with mancozeb @ 0.25% followed by amectoctradin + dimethomorph @ 0.2% or azoxystrobin + tebuconazole @ 0.1% at the time of disease appearance and one more spray with mancozeb @ 0.25% after 8–10 days of second spray in Hassan, Karnataka. Prophylactic spray with chlorothalonil @ 0.25% followed by dimethomorph + mancozeb @ 0.3% at the time of disease appearance and one more spray with chlorothalonil @ 0.25% after 8–10 days of second spray in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir. Characterization of viruses infecting vegetable crops: Newly emerging yellowing disease on cucurbitaceous crops such as, squash, watermelon, pumpkin, sponge gourd and ivy gourd were documented as Polerovirus transmitted by aphids. On the basis of gene sequence analysis, these were identified as cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV), melon aphid- borne yellows virus (MABYV) and luffa aphid-borne yellows virus (LABYV).
