 Their implementation with current irrigation systems can reduce the water losses caused by over-irrigation (runoff and seepage). These losses are the primary carriers of applied fertilizers and pesticides into nearby water bodies. Agriculture 2024, 14, 1141 10 of 40 Table 1. Some of the studies published on proposing smart IWS systems. Study Object Crop/Factor Input Parameters Smart Tool Outcome SIS [48]. Maize SM, CD, and IM DRL DRL tools are a potential method of IS. Soil moisture [49]. Citrus CD RS Tool exhibited the highest accuracy in predicting SM, with R2 of 0.635–0.921 and RRMSE of 7.214–18.564%. Automation of drip system [50]. Agricultural fields CD and SM FL and WSAN The tool can calculate crops’ water needs and provide a scientific basis for water-saving irrigation to optimize fertilizer use. Irrigation water quality [51]. Water resources Water FL The system helps farmers identify polluted water and decide on reliable IS. SIS [52]. Olive grove parcels SM and CD IoT The proposed tool can be employed as a support service tool for SISs. SIS [53]. Corn SM and CD IoT Earlier harvesting and higher yield were found under the smart IWS system. SIM [54]. Rice SM and water height IoT A total of 82–88% and 57% labor savings were observed during the flush-irrigation and ponding period. SIM [55]. Soilless crops SM, CD, and IM GCS The new MCP system significantly reduced input cost by 50% compared to other commercial smart systems. SIM [56]. Agricultural field CD and SM FL and IoT The proposed SIM significantly conserved and saved water and energy. SIS [57]. Tomato SM, CD, and IM DQN Improve yield by 11% and decrease WC by 20–30%. SIM [58]. Agricultural field SM, CD, and IM FL The second mode is more efficient and saves WC by 70%. Smart irrigation system [59]. Agricultural field SM and CD IoT The proposed approach reduced water utilization and labor engaged for irrigation. SIM [60]. Agricultural field SM and CD FL The system achieved WC by 94.74% more than the conventional manual system. Irrigation requirement forecasting [61]. Grass, farm, and arable land CD and SM DLNN The proposed model showed high IWSs compared to others. IoT-based SIS [62]. Agricultural field CD AI & PM The SIS presented as the superior system with 11% water saving compared to the traditional method. SIM [63]. Agricultural field SM and CD FL The approach reduced irrigation costs by 30% and WC by 45% compared to the traditional method. SIM [64]. Agricultural field CD and SM WSAN Conserved water up to 81% of WC. Predicting the occurrence of irrigation events [65]. Tomato, maize rice CD and IM DT Developed models have been able to predict between 68% and 100% of the positive irrigation events and between 93% and 100% of the negative irrigation events. Predicting irrigation scheduling [66]. Potato SM, CD, and IM LSTM The system attains an IWSs ranging from 20 to 46%. CIMIS [67].
