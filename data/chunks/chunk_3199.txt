 • Agronomic management packages of practice developed for scented rice, hybrids, and direct seeded rice were developed. • Integrated nutrient management involving organic and inorganic nutrients for sustaining rice based cropping system productivity and profitability was evolved. • A eight row drum seeder for direct seeding of sprouted seed in puddle soil t save labour and water without sacrificing yield was developed and popularized. • New sources of resistance to major insect pests and diseases were identified through germplasm evaluation. • Variability in pest and pathogen population is being monitored to identify new races and biotypes being developed. • New sage and effective chemicals for control of insect pests, diseases and weeds have been identified. www.icar.org.in 77 2002 ‐ 2007 • Integrated pest management system for location and situation specific needs developed and evaluated. • In all 128 training programmes were organized on need basis and about 2000 personnel trained in rice • production technologies • Frontlines demonstrations were organized on over 12,750 ha in 18 states coverin rice varieties, production and protection technologies thus carrying the proven technology to the door step of the end user clientale i.e.the rice farmer. www.icar.org.in 78 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science All India Coordinated Research Project on Safflower 1.
