 Nursery raising: Apply 15 to 20 tonnes of FYM per hectare in the nursery field before sowing of the nursery. Application of 25 kg N, 25 kg P2O5 and 25 kg ZnSO4 per hectare is applied for raising the nursery. Apply second doze of 25 kg N/ha at two weeks after sowing of nursery. If deficiency symptoms of Iron appear in the nursery, foliar application of 0.5 % FeSo4 should be done. For managements of weeds in the nursery, apply 1.5 kg Pretilachlore 30 EC or 3 litreButachlore or Thiobencarb at 1-3 days after sowing of the nursery. For management of broad leaf and grassy weeds, apply 250 ml Bispyribak sodium 10 SL at 15 days after sowing of nursery. Transplanting: Transplanting of paddy is done by manual as well as mechanical method. a) Manual transplanting: yy Transplant the seedlings in lines yy Transplant 2-3 seedlings per hill yy Maintain spacing of 15 x 15 cm yy Depth of transplanting should not be more than 2-3 cm ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 44 b) Mechanical transplanting yy Done by paddy transplanter in puddled and un-puddled conditions. yy Raising of mat type nursery is required Fertilizer use:   Apply 150 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, 60 kg K2O and 25 kg ZnSO4 per hectare for medium, mid-early duration and hybrid varieties of rice.   Apply 120 kg, 60 kg P2O5, 60 kg K2O and 25 kg/ha for early duration varieties.   Full doze of phosphorus, potash, zinc and 1/3 doze of nitrogen should be applied at the time of puddling.   Remaining doze of nitrogen should be applied in two splits equally at 3 and 6 weeks after transplanting.   Application of 15 tonnes of FYM/ha before transplanting of the crop is useful for obtaining good productivity of rice-wheat system continuously. Weed management: Several grassy weeds, broad leaf weeds and sedges infest paddy crop. Puddling though in helpful in management of many weeds, yet weeds can be managed effectively by chemical method.   Apply 30 kg butachlore or 15 kg thiobencarbgranuls/ ha in 4-5 cm deep water at 2-3 days after transplanting. Apply 3.0 liter butachlor 50 EC or thiobencarb EC or 1325 ml Anilphose 30 EC or 2.0 liter Pretilachlor 50 EC or 125 g oxydiazeril 80 % WP after mixing with 150 kg sand and broadcast in standing water at 2-5 days after transplanting.   Management of broad leaf weeds can be done by application of 20 g ready mix of metsulphuron and chlorimuron or 125 g ethoxysulphuron 15 % WG or 1 kg 2,4-D ester at 20-25 days after transplanting.   Management of broad leaf weeds can also be done by application of 93.75 ml/ha in 500 liters of water phenoxulam 24 % SC at 8-12 days after transplanting.   Management of mix weeds flora in rice can be done by application of 250 ml bispyribac sodium 10 % SL/ha in 500 litres of water at 15-25 days after transplanting. Direct Seeding of Rice Crop (DSR) The technique of direct seeding of rice crop has attracted attention of policy makers.
