 The five criteria for ranking were: extent of protection of sugar from ants during rainy season, extent of protection of sugar from ants during winter season, extent of protection of sugar from ants in kitchen and extent of protection of sugar from ants in store. The key informants were asked to give score separately on each criterion for each treatment. The average score was calculated and the data were subjected to ANOVA test. Experiment Experiments were conducted in six villages in two phases. During the first phase there were 20 experiments for sugar and 10 for sugar products with three treatments each. The first phase, treatments were: control, with 15 cloves per kg sugar and 25 cloves per kg sugar. For sugar products the treatments were: control, with 20 cloves per kg and 30 cloves per kg. The results of the first-phase experiment indicated that where the cloves were placed with sugar or sugar products irrespective of quantity, no ants were observed even after 10 days, though ants were observed in a few cases under control treatment. Hence the experiment could not provide the exact quantity of cloves to be placed. In view of this, during second phase the number of cloves was reduced and the treatments were:   GRAIN/SEED STORAGE Table 1.

In addition, experiments were conducted where ants were already present to see the effect of placing 5 cloves, 10 cloves and 15 cloves per kg in case of sugar, and 10 cloves, 15 cloves and 20 cloves per kg in case of sugar products. Table 1 provides the number of replications used during the study. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field survey As many as 60 villagers from six villagers were contacted during the pilot field study. It was reported that they generally put cloves when they see that small ants are there with sugar or sugar products. There is no other method by which they can separate or get away these ants. If the ants are removed mechanically by hand or by other means, many of them are killed and then it is not possible to remove. Sometimes, the whole sugar or sugar product is spoiled and has to be thrown away. Once they keep 10â€“15 cloves (per kg sugar) in the pot where sugar or sugar product is kept, the ants get away in 6 to 10 hours.
