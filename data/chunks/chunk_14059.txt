 In addition, any harmful outcomes such as pollution, must be reduced or entirely eliminated from the system. Changes in farm size (Jatav, 2021), altered land use patterns (Jatav et al., 2022), unsustainable agricultural policies (Concepcion et al., 2008), natural disasters (Singh and Singh, 2019), environmental pollution, and climate change are some of economic, social, and environmental issues currently affecting agricultural systems (Ali and Erenstein, 2017). Nearly 11.00% of the world’s population (7.42 billion people) live in severe poverty, most of them reside in rural areas of Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2018). Since 78.00% of poor people rely on agriculture and related businesses for income, agricultural development has the potential to greatly alleviate rural poverty. The World Bank (2007) found that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in agricultural sector is at least twice that in other sectors in terms of poverty reduction, i.e., a 1.00% rise in GDP in any non-farm sector leads to a 1.00% reduction in poverty, whereas a 1.00% increase in agricultural sector reduces poverty by 2.00%. Hence, agricultural growth should be at the center of anti-poverty strategies in India (Mottaleb, 2018). In terms of its contribution to India’s economic growth, agriculture is responsible for around 42.00% of the country’s total employment and 16.00% of GDP, and agriculture land accounts for 60.00% of the total land area (World Bank, 2016). Despite being a signiﬁcant source of employment, the share of agriculture in GDP has been on decline over the last 60 years, going from around 54.00% in 1960–1961 to 16.00% in 2020–2021 (GoI, 2021). The major reasons for the decline include climate change, poor infrastructure, poor management of agricultural markets, farmers' poor socio-economic conditions, inefﬁcient state agricultural policy execution, and farmers' lack of understanding about agricultural technology (Swami et al., 2018; Jatav, 2022; Jatav et al., 2022). Now, India is facing a four-dimensional agricultural crisis of declining farm income, rising farm expenditure, depletion of natural resources, and impaired ago-biodiversity (GoI, 2020; Singh, 2020a). Additionally, there is a positive correlation between average farm revenue and farm size (Chand et al., 2011). However, the percentage of big farms fell from 6.00% to 3.00%, while the percentage of small farms rose from 59.00% to 67.00% in India from 1991 to 2011 (GoI, 2021). According to the report of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2017), due to rapid urbanization and increased family wealth, the Indian diet is gradually diversifying. The per- centage of cereal to overall food spending decreased from 52.00% in 1972 to 29.00% in 2006. The dynamics of food market system and food processing system is impacted by dietary change towards non-staple food industry in India. The consumption of fertilizer is 165.00 kg/hm2 in India, higher than the global average of 138.
