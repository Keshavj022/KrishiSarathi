Hand tools for weeding, harvesting, decortication; bullock-drawn tillage implements for uplands and puddling; multipurpose bullock-drawn tool frame on which tillage and sowing equipment could be mounted; line sowing and planting equipment that may be operated with draught power or tractors, and paddy transplanters (manual, power-tiller operated or self-propelled) are a few examples. Seed-cum-ertilizer drills (bullock- and tractor-operated) for line sowing and fertilizer application in dryland agriculture have led to considerable increase in productivity. Groundnut, maize, potato and the sugarcane require special planting machinery. Smaller seeds — pearlmillet, rapeseed and mustard — also require specialized seed-metering mechanism (less than 4 kg/ha) for which seed-cum-fertilizer drills and planters have been developed. They are widely used. Practice of modern agriculture has led to manifold increase in yields. Efficient harvesting and threshing machinery — improved sickles, combine harvesters (self-propelled and tractor-operated), power tillers, and tractor-operated reapers, hammer mil-type threshers — have reduced the turnaround time. Development of spiked-tooth and dummy threshers are revolutionary achievements of our engineers. Multicrop threshers have been developed for versatility and economy. To avoid mishaps, the Dangerous Agricultural Machinery Act has been enforced. Irrigation of crops is not only essential for their survival but also for increasing productivity. About 76.
