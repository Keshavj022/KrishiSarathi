 Climate-resilient practices to optimize productivity, establishing robust value chains and better market access are few critical steps for Indian Farming 75 (01): 86-88; January 2025 enhancing income of smallholder farmers. Specific ways and means of achieving these objectives are elaborated. Agro-processing centres Agro-processing centres form a very short value chain. Value-addition at these centres, such as processing millets into flour or pulses into dal, significantly enhances the economic value of agricultural produce, allowing farmers to capture higher profits. By facilitating employment and promoting rural entrepreneurship, agro-processing centres also contribute to rural development. These centres create jobs in sorting, grading, milling, packaging, and transportation, fostering inclusive growth and empowering women and youth. Additionally, by acting as aggregation points for smallholder farmers, agro-processing centres enhance market access by linking farmers directly to wholesale buyers, export markets, and e-commerce platforms. This reduces farmers’ dependence on intermediaries and improves their bargaining power. Furthermore, these centres promote decentralized processing, ensuring that value addition happens near the production sites, reducing transportation costs and preserving product freshness. Agro-processing centres are essential for transforming agricultural products into value-added goods, particularly in rainfed systems. These models address specific processing needs based on regional crop patterns, such as cereals, pulses, fruits, and vegetables. By providing decentralized processing infrastructure, these centres reduce post-harvest losses, Indian Farming 87 January 2025 improve income for smallholders, and promote local entrepreneurship. The modular design of these APC models allows for scalability, ensuring that both small and large farming communities can benefit from them. With the right policy support and financial incentives, these agro-processing centres will play a key role in building sustainable value chains and boosting rural economies. Decentralized storage Support for decentralized storage of grains, fruits and vegetables with public and private partnership at block level near to the agro-processing centres instead of centralized storage may be useful. Recent announcement of Government for building warehouses at local level under 'World’s Largest Cooperative Food Grain Storage Scheme' will help a lot in this endeavour. The plan entails creation of various agri infrastructure facilities at PACS (Primary Agricultural Credit Society) level including decentralized godowns, custom hiring centres, processing units. Farming communities of rainfed areas need to be encouraged to come together and form the societies to tap funds from this umbrella scheme.
