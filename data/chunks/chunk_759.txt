 Keywords: Alternate crops, Crop diversification, Underutilized fruit crops F RUITS are undoubtedly known as protective as they are rich in vitamins, phytochemicals and minerals. They are excellent source of soluble dietary fiber, which helps in lowering the cholesterol level and fats from the body, and also helps in smooth bowel movements. Antioxidant properties help in removal of free radicals from the body, and thus provide protection against many chronicle and infectious disease. Since time immemorial, edible wild fruits have played a very vital role in supplementing the diet to the poor masses especially tribes of country. Apart from customary use as food, wild edible fruits have various health advantages as they potentially give immunity to many diseases. Most of the important underutilized fruits are indigenous and it is easily available, can play major role for socio- economic upliftment of poor masses of the country in changing climatic scenario. In India, alternate fruit crops for food system are bael (Aegle marmelos), chironji (Buchanania lanzan), karonda (Carissa congesta), ker (Capparis decidua), phalsa (Grewia asiatica), pilu (Salvadora oleoides), jamun (Syzygium cuminii), kokam (Garcina indica), malabar tamarind (G. cambogia), tamarind (Tamarindus indica), monkey jack (Atrocarpus lakoocha), ber (Ziziphus mauritiana), lasoda (Cordia dichotoma), wood apple (Feronia limonia), custard apple (Annona squamosa), fig (Ficus carica), cape gooseberry (Physalis peruviana) phalsa (Grewia subinaequalis), mulberry (Morus nigra), manila tamarind (Pithecellobium dulce), timru (Diospyrus melenoxylon), mahua (Madhuca indica) and palmyra palm (Borassus flabellifer), elephant apple (Dillenia indica), pummelo (Citrus grandis) carambola (Averrhoa carambola), loquat (Eriobotya japonica), sugar date palm (Phoenix sylvestris), mahua (Bassia latifolia), mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana), etc. These fruit crops are rich source of vitamins (ascorbic acid, thiamine, niacin, pyridoxine and folacin), minerals, fat, protein, and dietary fiber. These crops can be grown with minimal management under aberrant agro-climatic conditions. Nutritional significance Underutilized fruit crops can be “bridge crops,” filling nutritional gaps in the annual dietary cycle. These crops can be continuously harvested over weeks or months and act as a long-term nutritional supplement. A farm or garden diverse in both species and cultivars will produce over an extended period and will provide a diversity of nutrients. Seasonal variation in food supply Indian Farming 73 (06): 66-69; June 2023 Indian Farming 67 June 2023 affects livelihoods as well. Times of abundance, such as during the harvest and sale of crops, alternate with periods during which savings dwindle. Underutilized fruit crops can improve livelihoods in two ways. First, income can be increased through specialty markets that pay a premium for unusual products or items available somewhat out of season.
