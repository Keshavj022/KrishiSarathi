 2. Target crops and delivery system: This bioformulation can be used for wheat. Inoculation can be done through seed treatment. 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): All 4. Validation and commercialization: The technology has been tested at farms of ICAR-IARI, New Delhi, ICAR- NBAIM, Mau and three centres of Punjab Agriculture University, Ludhiana. 5. Benefits: This formulation has shown remarkable response in improving the Fe content in wheat grains without compromising the yield. Inoculation can result in ~40-45% increase in Fe content (~55-65 ppm) in grains. Besides, this formulation significantly improves root architecture which can also improve other nutrient and water use efficiency. 6.

Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/ species): This is a unique kind of liquid bioformulation containing an archaea. It has a longer shelf life (12 – 24 months) without loss of microbial populations and properties upon exposure to high temperature. 2. Target crops and delivery system: This bioformulation can be used for wheat, maize and mustard. Inoculation can be done through seed treatment. 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): All 4. Validation and commercialization: The technology has been tested at farms of ICAR-NBAIM, Mau and under testing in twenty different centres of AICRP-NSP since last two years. 5. Benefits: This unique formulation can save 2-3 irrigations for the target crops. It helps to sustain the plant growth even in case of extreme water deficit and allow the farmers to attain some yield instead of complete crop failure 6.

Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/ species): Eco-Pesticide is a unique kind of talc-based bioformulation consisting of Pseudomonas fluorescens, a free-living bacterium and establishes robust and long-lasting colonisation on root surfaces and penetrates into the epidermis and a few cells below this level. It has a longer shelf life (12 – 18 months) under ambient room temperature. 2. Target crops and delivery system: Eco-Pesticide can be used for cereals, millets, pulses, vegetables and commercial plantation crops. Inoculation can be done through seed treatment, root dip for seedlings and soil application for tree plants. 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): All 4.
