Furthermore, it could contribute to current issues of food and nutritional security at the household, community and national levels. Fish farming is predominantly appropriate for those farmers who face severe trouble with salinity in their soil, as traditional crops struggle to grow well in saline conditions. Therefore, the fresh water as well as marine fish farming can be treated as alternative source of traditional agriculture and may be integrated with it e.g. fish farming in crop field to enhance the productivity and income. *Corresponding author email: skumar710@gmail.com Mr Dinesh with his fish pond My : Ss Mr Dinesh with his fish pond of diseases etc. Considering these issues, here comes the multidimensional role of KVKs in nurturing of aquaculture and development of aquapreneurs.
