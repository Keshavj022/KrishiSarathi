The little fat present in potato contributes towards potato palatability. Major proportion (i.e nearly 60-80%) of potato fat consists of unsaturated fatty acids and linoleic acid is the predominant one. The high content of unsaturated fatty acids increases the nutritive value of the fat present in potato. When eaten without added fat, potato is good for weight conscious people because of its low energy density. However, when fat is added to the fried or processed potato products, it becomes rich in energy and may certainly become a cause of concern. Especially excessive consumption of processed potato products such as chips and French fries containing up to 40% fat may cause obesity. Potatoes: Good source of Vitamins Potato is one of the rich natural source of vitamin C or ascorbic acid as it contains 17-35 mg of ascorbic acid per 100 g tuber. Potatoes have high quantities of vitamin C than other vegetables like carrots, onion and beet root. When consumed in sufficient quantities, potatoes itself can meet all the vitamin C requirements of an individual. Potato is an important source of thiamine, niacin and pyridoxine and its derivatives (vitamin B6 group). It also contains pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), riboflavin and folic acid. B-vitamins are essential for general health and growth, since they are water soluble. A small potato can deliver more than 20% daily value of vitamin C and vitamin B6. Vitamin C: Potato contains 17-35 mg/100 g vitamin C which is far high compared to corn, wheat, rice, sorghum and beans. Indian potatoes are a good source of vitamin C and it ranges from 20 to 59 mg/100 g fresh weight in raw tubers. This water-soluble vitamin acts as an antioxidant and stabilizes or eliminates free radicals, thus helping to prevent cellular damage. Potato as major source of vitamin C provides protection against scurvy. Vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron in human body and may help support the bodyâ€™s immune system. The ascorbic acid content of potato declines when potatoes are stored, cooked or processed. Though potato loses some of its vitamin C during storage, substantial amounts are retained until it sprouts. Potato being in reach of all income groups -0.2 0.3 0.8 1.3 1.8 2.3 2.8 3.3 3.8 4.
