 Hence, maintaining a balance between nutrient inputs and nutrient removal by the sugarcane crop is crucial for effective soil fertility management and sustainability of the soil health. Keywords: Fertility, Nutrient, Soil health, Sugarcane S UGARCANE holds significant importance in India as a primary cash crop and a major global sugar source, contributing to about 70% of the worldâ€™s sugar supply. It contains roughly 84% pure juice and 16% dietary fibre, offers both sweetness and digestive benefits, promoting regular bowel movements. In sugarcane cultivation, the fertility of the soil directly influences various aspects of the crop, from its overall vigour to stalk development, sugar content, and overall productivity. Sugarcane is a nutrient-intensive crop and continuous cultivation can deplete soil nutrients, making it essential to replenish these nutrients through proper soil management practices. Soil testing and analysis can help in determining the specific nutrient needs of the soil, allowing for more targeted and efficient fertilization. Overall, managing soil fertility is essential for sustaining sugarcane production while minimizing negative environmental impacts. Indian Farming 73 (11): 17-20; November 2023 Soil fertility management in sugarcane crop production Effective soil fertility management is pivotal in achieving optimal yield, quality, and sustainability in sugarcane crop production. It ensures that sugarcane plants access essential nutrients throughout their growth cycle for maximum yield. Soil testing provides valuable insights into the nutrient status of the soil, guiding the formulation of appropriate nutrient management plans. It involves analysis of soil samples to determine nutrient levels, pH, and other soil properties. Nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and various micronutrients are necessary for plant metabolism, photosynthesis, root development and sugar accumulation. Adequate nutrient availability also contributes to better tillering, higher number of millable canes (NMC), and increased biomass production; all of which positively impact cane productivity. Healthy soil enhances plant vigour and overall health, making sugarcane more resistant to diseases and pests. Therefore, regular soil testing is a valuable tool for identifying nutrient status, deficiencies and developing appropriate nutrient management strategies. Nutrient requirement in sugarcane Sugarcane crop requires a balanced supply of both macronutrients and micronutrients for optimal growth and development. Nitrogen requirement of sugarcane is higher during the tillering phase followed by early grand growth phase i.e., 40 to 160 days after planting (Fig. 1). The optimum time of phosphorus application is at initial stages of tillering so that sufficient phosphorus should be available in the soil during formative phase of crop for better growth and development. Early and late, both, application of potash is usually recommended.
