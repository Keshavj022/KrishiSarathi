IC0128565 21030 Resistant to leaf rust. IC0128638 21031 Resistance to leaf rust and yield stability across the locations. IC638868 21094 Drought tolerance. IC638869 21095 Leaf rust resistance (LrT) and gluconess (IwT). IC0638873 21096 Resistant to powdery mildew. Two powdery mildew resistance genes PmTb7A.1 and PmTbA.2 mapped on chromosome 7AL. IC252458 21097 Consist of three minor/adult plant rust resistance genes (APR) for leaf rust, Lr34+ (Lr34/Sr57/Yr18//Pm38/Ltn1), Lr46+(Lr46/ Sr58/Yr29/Pm39/Ltn2) and Lr67+ (Lr67/Yr46/Sr55/Pm46/Ltn3) which is linked to stem, stripe and powdery mildew resistance genes. Resistant to the prevailing leaf rust pathotypes of India due to the synergistic combination of minor leaf rust resistance genes. Presence of leaf tip necrosis (LTN) on the flag leaves, a phenotypical marker that is linked to adult plant resistance (APR) genes. IC290150 21098 Consist of three minor/adult plant rust resistance genes (APR) for leaf rust, Lr34+ (Lr34/Sr57/Yr18//Pm38/Ltn1), Lr67+(Lr67/ Yr46/Sr55/Pm46/Ltn3) and Lr68 which is linked to stem, stripe and powdery mildew resistance genes. Resistant to the prevailing leaf rust pathotypes of India due to the synergistic combination of minor leaf rust resistance genes. Presence of leaf tip necrosis (LTN) on the flag leaves, a phenotypical marker that is linked to adult plant resistance (APR) genes. GENETIC RESOURCES ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 27 (Contd...)
