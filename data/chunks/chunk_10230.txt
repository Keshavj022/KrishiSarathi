 Substantial improvement has been made in sorghum with the development and release of 223 varieties and hybrids released by different states. The feat of improved productivity could be achieved by exploitation of heterosis through hybrid breeding particularly in Kharif season. The hybrids, CSH 9, CSH 14, CSH 16, and CSH 30 are widely cultivated in Kharif season. Further, CSH 35 and CSH 41 are also getting popular in recent times. Among Kharif varieties, CSV 15, CSV 27, and CSV 31 along with many state releases are promising with higher net incomes realization from sorghum cultivation. Potential rabi varieties available to farmers are CSV 216R, CSV 18, CSV 22R, CSV 26R and CSV 29R among others. In sorghum, there has been an increase in productivity from 458 kg ha-1 in 1965 to 989 kg ha-1 in 2019. Small millets improvement efforts during the late 1950s and 60s have contributed significantly by releasing several HYVs and developing crop protection and agronomical techniques. However, real growth in finger millet productivity was achieved during 1950-60 when the hybridization technique was successfully established. The finger millet varieties, CFMV 1 and 2 are rich in calcium, iron, and zinc, and the little millet variety, Indian Agriculture after Independence 90 CCLMV1 is rich in iron and zinc. In the other five small millets, genetic improvement has been limited due to lack of genetic diversity, difficulty in recombination breeding, and lack of serious crop improvement programmes with requisite funding support. A total of 211 small millets varieties have been released in the country with 136 varieties in finger millet. Box 4: CSH 16 - A landmark sorghum hybrid CSH 16 is a medium duration kharif sorghum hybrid released in 1997 had high acceptability amongst the sorghum farmers because of its grain quality. The hybrid yields, on average, 4.1 t ha-1 of grain and very popular in the states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. It also performed well in the rice fallows in the coastal belt of Andhra Pradesh where the yields of sorghum obtained ranged from 5 to 8 t ha-1. CSH 16 in rice fallows is a success story. The last ten years results revealed CSH 16 yielding 7.73 t ha-1, significantly better than the locally popular private hybrids. Table 4.
