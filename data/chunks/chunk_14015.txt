 A perusal of the result reveals that the adaptation of the CSAT increases farmers’ happiness. This result is consistent with the results of Dinesh et al. (2015) and Rosenstock et al. (2016). The result reveals that the marginal effect of the use of CSAT on the happiness of the farmers is 0.149, 0.181 and, 0.144 for the farmers whose intensity of use of CSAT is between 0.251 and 0.500, 0.501–0.750 and, 0.751 and above respectively, over the farmers whose level of CSAT use is in between 0.0 and 0.250. This im- plies that farmers using moderate levels of CSAT are happier than otherwise. This may be due to the fact that at a lower level of technology use, the farmers may not be able to reap the beneﬁts, and at a higher level of technology use, the cost involved may not have that effect on the farmers. The households with a moderate LSC (0.251–0.500) have a negative impact on the happiness of the farmers. The marginal effect of the LSC for these groups of farmers on their happiness is 0.047 in comparison to the farmers having a lower LSC (0.00–0.250). However, one interesting observation from the result is that with the increase in LSC among the farmers, the level of happiness is increasing (the coefﬁ- cient of LSC at the level of 0.501–0.750 is positive, though signiﬁcant at the 12% level). This justiﬁes the importance of social capital in Fig. 7. Cross-referencing the level of happiness with reasons for females not using the climate-smart agricultural technology (CSAT) and gender-wise land ownership (%). Note: *** denotes a 1% level of signiﬁcance. D. Sahoo et al. Farming System 3 (2025) 100124 11 promoting happiness among farmers. This can be explained in line with the study of Narayan and Cassidy (2001), which justiﬁes that social capital can result in a spillover effect of technology use among the group, promoting happiness and well-being in the group. The LAE is an indicator of the extent of use of CSAT. The beta regression result reveals that the HI increases by 0.083, 0.328 and 0.095 for a unit level change in AE 0.251–0.500, 0.501–0.750 and 0.751 and above, respectively, over the farmers whose level of AE is between 0.0 and 0.250. This shows that farmers who spend a moderate amount on their agricultural activities achieve relatively better happiness. This result is also supported by the use of CSAT and the study of Rosenstock et al. (2016). The HI increases for the tribal community (ST), though it reduces for the OBC in comparison to the SC communities. This explores some cast and community dynamics of the subjective well-being of the people, which is new to the literature. In fact, tribal communities residing mostly away from the mainland are generally happy with their limited belongings when they live with nature. Further, the result indicated that with growing age, which brings in experience, farming households tend to adopt the CSAT, which further improves their happiness.
