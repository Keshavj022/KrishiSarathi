 They are highly adapted under agro-climatic condition of Papum Pare. Sowing of Toria may be extended up to 15th of November in case of available moisture in the soil. Intercultural operation like hand weeding to be carried out at 30, 60 and 90 Days after Sowing. Harvesting of silique to be done at between 120-150 DAS To control mustard aphid spraying of 5% neem seed kernel extract (NSKE) or Azadiractin 1500 ppm @ 5ml/litre of water. Potato The soil should be friable, porous, and well drained. The optimum pH range is 4.8 to 5.4. It is a cool weather crop. Potato is mostly grown as a rainfed crop. It is cultivated in regions receiving a rainfall of 1200 â€“ 2000 mm per annum. Ploughing of fields for the Potato to be completed by second fortnight of October till 15thof November with ridge and furrow methods of planting. Select the certified and disease-free seed potato tuber for planting. Potato tuber may be treated with Azotobacter and Phosphobacteria each @ 2gm/kg of tuber before planting. The treated tuber may be shade dry for half an hour and planting to be completed by first fortnight of November. Timely sowing ensures the optimum crop growth. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 249 For planting in one ha of area, 22-25 q/ha tubers require with 2-3 eyes and 25-45 gm weight of each tuber by maintaining planting distance of 60 x 20 cm. Suitable variety for Potato is Kufri Pokhraj, Khufri Bahar, Khufri Alankar, K. Jyoti, K. Kanchan (red-skinned) recommended for cultivation in Arunachal Pradesh. First irrigation to be given at 10-12 days or after germination, second at tuberisation at 25 days after planting, 3rd at initiation of tuber at 40 DAP and 4th at development of Tuber at 50-70 DAP. For early blight of potato spraying with mancozeb @ 2.5g/litre of water at 15 days interval for 3 times. Intercultural operation like hand weeding to be carried out at 30, 60 and 90 Days after Sowing. Two earthing up operation may be done at 30-35 DAP and second at 25-30 DAP of first earthing up followed by light irrigation Irrigation should be stopped at least 10 days before haulm cutting and harvesting of Potato to be completed by mid-February on a sunny day to avoid rotting of tubers due to high temperature. Dehaulming (removal of foliage and stem portions) should be done 10-15 days before harvesting which will allow hardening of tuber skin. This practice is highly recommended for production of tubers meant to be kept for seed purpose. Late Blight: For management of dreaded late blight in potato ensure early sowing (Mid October) of the seeds. When crop is full grown keep vigilance for weather condition. If cloudy, foggy, or rainy weather is forecasted then a prophylactic spray Ridomil @ 2.5g/liter of water at 15 days interval for 3 times.
