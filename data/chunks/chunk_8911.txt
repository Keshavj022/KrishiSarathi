 The overall means of LSB, LWB, LSW, WKDL achieved this year were 6.08, 337.36, 5.03 kg and 1,733.03 g respectively. Reproductive performance was better than the previous year with respect to LWW and WKDL. LSB and WKDL were better in SC while LWW was better in WG. The overall body weights at 4, 6, 12 and 24 weeks of age were 350.09, 658.38, 1,452.42 and 2,274.63 g, respectively. Higher body weights were recorded in WG and SC in all stages. Season had highly significant effect on body weights. July to December period was better for growth than January to June. Females had significantly higher body weights than males at 24 weeks of age. Adult body weights declined from April to August and increased from September to March. At North Temperate Regional Station, Garsa, Kullu, body weight at 84 days of the different breeds were relatively more than recorded in previous year except in Grey Giant. Daily weight gain was highest in rabbits weaned at 28 days as compared to animals weaned at 35 to 42 days. The kit survivability in different breeds ranged from 94 to 100%. Angora Rabbit for Wool The population of German Angora (new) increased with a kit survivability of 97.4%. The average litter size at birth and weaning was 5.01 and 4.88, respectively. The average litter weight at birth was 281.03 g while the average 42 day weaning weight was 683.3 g. The pooled average wool yield of the general flock was 671.4 g and that of breeding flock 685 g. POULTRY Poultry for Meat Under the AICRP on Poultry for Meat the mass selection for 6-week body weight with more emphasis on conformation traits in male line, and egg production and hatchability in female line, continued. The sub lines, SG and SF derived from SML- 2 at CARI Centre, Izatnagar, exceeded 1,700 g at 6 weeks and were superior to the controls both at 4 and 6 weeks of age. The estimated genetic and phenotypic responses, respectively, were 46.77 and 47.02 g in SG and 51.86 and 51.95 g in SF line at 6 weeks of age. The feed conversion ratio showed a desirable decline over the last 3 generations, phenotypically. The average body weight at 6-weeks of age in the S-6 generation was 1,640 g. The synthetic dam line at the CARI showed positive genetic response of 15.53 and 38.64 g for body weight in 4 and 6 weeks, respectively. At the OUAT, Bhubaneshwar, evaluation and regeneration of the synthetic dam line received from the CARI, Izatnagar, were under progress. The body weight of males and females at 6-weeks of age were 1,355 and 1,148 g with an average feed conversion ratio of 2.29. The average egg number up to 40 weeks of age was 55.28. The body weights of Pb-2 at 4 and 6 weeks exceeded the corresponding body weights of the last generation at the PAU, Ludhiana.
