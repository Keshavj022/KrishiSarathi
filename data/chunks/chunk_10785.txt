   Deworming of animals should be carried out.   Maize, perennial grasses and other fodder species should be harvested now.   Sheep should be sheared during this month. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 49 Zone–3 Uttar Pradesh 1. Paddy 1.1 Direct Seed Rice (DSR) Rice Direct seeded rice (DSR), probably the oldest method of crop establishment, is gaining popularity because of its low-input demand. It offers certain advantages viz., it saves labour, requires less water, less drudgery, early crop maturity, low production cost, better soil physical conditions for following crops and less methane emission, provides better option to be the best fit in different cropping systems. In present scenario when human interaction is avoided the machine driven DSR technology is better option for planting rice Suitable Varieties:MTU-7029, Pusa Sugandha 4, Pusa Rice Hybrid 10, NDR-9930111, Sambha Sub-1 and NDR-9436 Land preparation   Plow the fields during summer to control emerging weeds   Level the fields to facilitates uniform irrigation and better crop germination Machinery Requirement   Minimum-till drill/Power tiller drill   Zero-till drill   Bed drilling Seed depth and soil moisture   Optimum depth of seed:2-3 cm. The seed should be covered by soil for proper germination and to avoid bird damage.   In lowlands and finer textured soils, planking may not be necessary after seeding.   Soil moisture content at seeding should be sufficient for proper germination   Surface mulch helps to retain soil moisture for longer time which may improve emergence and reduce weed menace Seed rate and cultivars for DSR   Seed rate:60 to 80 kg/ha, in general   Lesser seed rate for fine grain and Basmati cultivars Early to medium short duration cultivars having early vigor Suitable cultivars are as mentioned above. Seeding time   Drill the dry seed of normal rice at the start of monsoon i.e. when farmers put seed into nursery bed   May 3rd week to June 2nd week (Jesth 1st week to Jesth 3rd week ) ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 50 Seed treatment:   Seed treatment with recommended fungicide is necessary to manage soil born diseases. For this, weighed quantity of seeds are soaked in water added with fungicide (Bavistin @ 1g/kg rice seed or Emisan @ 1gm/kg rice seed) solution and kept for 24 hours. Amount of water used for soaking is equivalent to quantity of seed used for seed treatment. After 24 hours, seeds are removed from fungicide solution and dried in shade for 1-2 days until sprouting is seen before sowing. Seed treatment with imidacloprid (Guicho/imidiate) @ 3ml/kg seed to be done to protect from soil-borne pathogens such as termites or other insects or in combination with tebuconazole (raxil) @ 1 ml/kg seed to protect from both soil borne fungi and insects have been found effective in improving uniform crop establishment. Fertilizer management:   Fertilizer recommendation for DSR is same as for puddled transplanted rice.
