 In general, flax is thought of as a plant with two main uses: fibre and seeds. High strength and durability are two characteristics of the flax stem fibre. The seeds offer digestible proteins, lignans, and oil that contain omega-3 fatty acids. Furthermore, linseed has a lot of potential as a source of phenolic compounds and is a potent source of soluble fibre and high-quality protein. Linseed has thus emerged as one of the most significant oilseed crops for industrial uses, as well as being a source of food and feed, as well as fibre.

It has several applications and specializations based on its processing and additives. Raw/unrefined linseed oil: This is the purest form of linseed oil obtained by cold-pressing flaxseed. It is commonly used in traditional oil painting as a binder for pigments. Boiled linseed oil: Boiled linseed oil is raw linseed oil that has been heated to enhance its drying time. It contains added drying agents such as metallic salts or petroleum- based additives. Boiled linseed oil dries faster than raw linseed oil and is commonly used as a wood finish, either alone or blended with other oils. Stand oil: Stand oil is a highly refined and polymerized form of linseed oil. It undergoes a heating process to increase its viscosity and improve its drying properties. Stand oil dries slowly, giving a glossy finish and enhancing the durability of the paint film. Sun-thickened linseed oil: Sun- thickened linseed oil is obtained by exposing raw linseed oil to sunlight or UV radiation. This process causes the oil to polymerize and thicken. It is used in various applications such as varnishes, wood treatments, and as a traditional medium for oil painting. Modified linseed oil: Modified linseed oil refers to linseed oil that has undergone chemical modifications to enhance specific properties. These modifications can include polymerization, oxidation, or the addition of other compounds. Modified linseed oil may have improved drying time, increased film flexibility, or other specialized characteristics tailored for specific applications. Specifications of bast fibre Fibre flax, also known as linen flax or textile flax, is a variety of flax plants cultivated specifically for its long, strong fibres. This ancient crop has been valued for centuries for its exceptional fibre quality and versatility. High-quality natural fibre: Fibre flax is renowned for its long, fine fibres that are derived from the stem of the plant.
