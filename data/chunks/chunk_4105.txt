Processing/ Medium Moderately resistant to late blight This is an old institute released potato variety (in 2010) and is already in seed chain. Prospects and challenges in potato Tropicalization of potato to warmer regions: Impact of global warming started manifesting potato crop and it has become imperative that further adaptation of potato from sub-tropical to more warmer growing condition would be necessary in near future to sustain its cultivation in the plains. In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Fourth Assessment Report predicted that the potato growing season in 2055 is likely to be warmer by 2.41–3.16°C. Research emphasis should be on developing short duration, early-maturing varieties with heat tolerance for both fresh consumption and processing.
