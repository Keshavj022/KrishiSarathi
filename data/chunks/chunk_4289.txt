 Similarly, average loss in income due to incidence of red spider mite was recorded as ` 336750, ` 323500 and ` 316300/ha, respectively during 2017, 2018 and 2019. y Realizing the increasing incidence of red spider mite in brinjal and losses caused in yield and income, technological interventions were made in which demonstrations were carried out on farmers fields at Bhimawala village of Vikasnagar block of Dehradun district and farm of Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Dhakrani, Dehradun during 2017 to 2019 with farmers in participatory mode. After Interventions y The technological interventions on management of red spider mite in brinjal crops were demonstrated on farmers field and KVK, Farm of Dehradun in which three application of acaricides namely hexythiazox 1ml per liter of water + propargite 1ml per liter of water + Sticker 0.5 ml per liter of water at 10 days interval were done. In order to observe the incidence of red spider mite, crop monitoring at regular interval was done by the farmers and scientists. y The first spraying was started 70 days after transplanting when symptom’s of red spider mite was seen. After that, second and third sprayings were given at 10 days interval by keeping in view the incidence of red spider mite during crop monitoring. y It was observed that three sprayings of above acaricides gave effective management of red spider Table 1. Impact of acarisides on incidence of spider mite and its effect on production and profitability of brinjal variety Chaya on farmer’s field Year Period Average incidence of spider mite on farmer’s field (%) Expenditure incurred on acaricides and their spraying (`/ha) Peak period of incidence of Spider mite Average yield loss due to incidence of Spider mite (%) Average loss in yield due to incidence of spider mite (`/ha) Average loss in income due to incidence of spider mite (`/ha) Average sale price (`/Q) 2017 March to October 82.46 3450 June-July 67.35 336.75 336750 1000 2018 March to October 77.32 3780 June-July 64.70 323.50 323500 1000 2019 March to October 71.25 3370 June-July 63.26 316.30 316300 1000 May–June 2023 47 mite due to which the average loss was 2.66% in 2017, 2.08% during 2018 whereas it was 1.68% in 2019. The average incidence of red spider mite in the demonstrated brinjal crop indicated that both the acaricides worked extremely well against red spider mite in all the three years. y The average yield was also recorded by pooling all the pickings which revealed that maximum yield i.e. 518.55 q/ha in 2019 followed by 512.38 q/ha during 2018 and 504.75 q/ha in 2017. The data on yield shows that three application of mentioned acaricides exhibited outstanding performance in effective management of red spider mite and enhancement in yield. y The data taken after every sale of brinjal were pooled and average income was calculated. The observations on income manifested that it was highest during 2019 which was `411750/ha closely followed by 2018 and Table 2.
