 Model fitting results The model-fitting results showed that the strongest fit for the pro­ portion of the four decision-making types in the sample population was utility maximization (60.8 %), followed by random choice (39.2 %). The weights obtained for self-satisficing and descriptive norms decision rules were equal to zero. This implied that the closest fit of simulated out­ comes of adaptation strategies with observed survey adaptation out­ comes occurred when a majority (60.8 %) of agents in our model were assigned the utility maximization decision rule and the remaining agents (39.2 %) were assigned the random choice decision rule. The fitted model with 60.8 % of agents as utility maximizers and 39.2 % of agents as random choicers explains the adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies (increased land preparation, enhanced use of fertilizers, high yielding varieties) but not climate-related technologies (improved irrigation, climate tolerant varieties, and late planting). 4.2. Model validation and sensitivity analysis results The fitted model with 60.8 % of agents as utility maximizers and 39.2 % of agents as random choicers was validated against observed outcomes (Fig. 3). The model performed well for the adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies, such as increased land prepara­ tion (MPR = 0.84) followed by the adoption of enhanced use of fertil­ izers (MPR = 0.81), and high yielding varieties (MPR = 0.66), Fig. 3.

However, the model performed poorly and overestimated the rates of adoption of climate-related technologies such as improved irrigation, climate tolerant varieties, and late planting (MPR = 1.5, 4.04, and 4.45, respectively). Fig. 4 & Table 4 shows the results of the distribution outputs and statistics from the uncertainty analysis. Note that, in all cases, the dis­ tributions were found to be roughly normal. Hence, variance is a good representative of model variability and can be easily used to evaluate model sensitivity (Lee et al., 2015). The results of the sensitivity analysis are highlighted in Fig. 5 based on an experimental setup for a generic model evaluation set such that an agent could select any of the four decision rules with equal probability. Each of the stack bars presents sensitivity index (ST) values for a given adaptation strategy. For example, for the climate tolerant variety (CTV) strategy, the decision rule input has ST = 0.93.
