 Rectal temperature, respiration rate and pulse rate in millipede fed animals of phase 2 PRA and field study Results from the field study indicated that 23% respondents consider the indigenous technology is very effective and 46% of respondents considered it effective for giving protection against fever to the animals (Tables 1 and 2).

Results obtained are presented in (Figs 1 and 2). It is seen that feeding millipede had no effect on the rectal temperature of the animals. No substantial difference was also observed on respiration rate and pulse rate of the animals. The variations observed on attributes of haeogram in 7 groups of animals are presented in Table 3. CONCLUSION No significance difference could be observed till 168 days of observations taken between the millipede fed animals and control animals in terms of rectal temperature, respiration rate and pulse rate. The technology for control of fever in animals by feeding millipedes does not seem to be effective.  VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Code : 1272 Title of the ITK : Treatment of swelling of shoulders in bullocks/bull Description of the ITK : Shoulders of bullocks are swollen, due to which they become unable to do work. Mixture of geru (30 g) and snail shell or sipi (50 g) is boiled in caster oil. Alua (20 g) and kudru/sahjan gum (50 g) are mixed to it.
