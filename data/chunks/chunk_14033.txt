05, the fixed effects model is used. Otherwise, the random effects model is preferred, ensuring that the analysis reflects both within- study and between-study variability (Bangar et al. 2015) [2]. Results and Discussion The study is restricted to data pertaining to the selected studies from the literature on profitability of organic agriculture over inorganic agriculture across the country. Estimating the profitability of organic agriculture in India through meta-analysis Performance of organic agriculture from selected studies The performance of organic agriculture was assessed by comparing mean incomes from organic and inorganic farming across 27 studies. The mean income for organic agriculture ranged from Rs. 801.60 per acre (Redgram) to Rs. 13,799.20 per acre (Tomato). This aligns with Kondaguri (2012) [12], who found higher net returns and B:C ratios for organic farms compared to inorganic ones. Conversely, four studies reported negative gains from organic agriculture, with losses ranging from Rs. -8,092.30 per acre (Turmeric) to Rs. -1,935 per acre (Cotton). These results are consistent with Raghuvanshi (2010), who observed a negative gain for organic paddy compared to inorganic paddy.
