 In this regard, the barriers grouped under the selected category are analysed using Fuzzy AHP in the next phase to determine the relative dominance of each barrier. Excluding the barriers (n = 2) falling under an unselected group, a total of thirty barriers falling under technical, social, behavioural, operational, economic, and implementation are included to develop a hierarchy model containing three levels. Level 1 represents the goal of this study i.e., determining the hierarchy of the barriers, while level-2 and level-3 depict the barrier categories and barriers, respectively. Fig. 8 illustrates the developed hierarchy model. Subsequent to developing the hierarchy model, the perception of experts on the relative dominance of each barrier is collected using the Saaty scale (ranging between 1 and 9). The collected responses are then further used to construct pairwise comparison matrices. A sample pairwise comparison matrix corresponding to the barrier categories is shown in Eq. (11). Equivalent matrices depicting the relative dominance of barriers in each category are also developed using the responses ob­ tained. It is observed that the consistency ratio of all the formulated matrices is within 0.1. E = ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ T S B O E I T 1 6.0 7.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 S 0.17 1 0.25 0.20 0.17 0.13 B 0.14 4.0 1 0.25 0.17 0.14 O 0.25 5.0 4.0 1 0.50 5.0 E 0.33 6.0 6.0 2.0 1 0.50 I 0.33 8.0 7.0 0.2 2 1 ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ (11) It is observed that the deviation corresponding to specific assessment across all the decision makers is negligible, owing to which an offset value of 1 is adopted to determine the TFN. The crisp scores obtained from all the experts are fuzzified using the TFNs shown in Fig. 7, resulting fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix as shown in Eq.12. The at­ tributes of the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix are further used to determine the overall fuzzy weight of each barrier category and the barriers within each category using Eqs. (7)–(10). Table 3 presents the fuzzy weights of each barrier category. For easy comparison of barrier categories, the fuzzy weights are defuzzified using Eq. (10). Results depict that ‘Technical aspects’ is the prime barrier for the adoption of UAVs in the Indian agriculture. Barriers under operational, economic, implementational, behavioural and social categories come next in the hierarchy. A similar analysis is performed for each barrier category separately, and the relative crisp weights are determined. The weights thus obtained are used to derive the priority in each category, referred to as a local priority in this study. Besides this, considering the weight of each category, the overall weight of each barrier is also computed and is referred as global weights. Table .4 presents the local and global weight of each barrier.
