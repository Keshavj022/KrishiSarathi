 A 24% of the GHGE worldwide in 2010 came from agricultural and allied activities, increased by more than 50% over the past 55 years [20, 21]. From 2001 to 2011, the agricultural systems were estimated to raise GHGE by 14%, and the developing world was noted to be a key driver of this increase [22]. India, a country that is predominately agrarian [23], comes in third place in terms of GHGE caused by agriculture (and related activities) [24]. Indian food system is crucial to the global challenge of ensuring enough nutritious food while reducing GHGE because it has the second-highest (1.3 billion) population in the world [25]. The primary production stage in India is when agricultural GHGE are at the highest [26]. By reducing GHGE and conserving atmospheric carbon in soil and vegetation systems, agriculture, through its direct contribution to global GHGE, can play a significant role in mitigating climate change [27,28]. One of the most effective ways to lower commercial energy demand and combat climate change is through increased agricultural energy effi­ ciency, which has been attracting attention on a global scale as the primary driver for sustainable development [29]. Energy efficiency improvement and energy saving are conducive to achieve environ­ mental friendly economic development [30]. Policymakers, including government officials, can use the measurement of eco-efficiency to ac­ quire the information necessary for making critical decisions that are focused on the effective management and consumption of natural re­ sources in the agricultural sector [28]. Eco-efficiency is a major identi­ fier used to evaluate the effectiveness of economic activities in relation to resource consumption, mental and social stresses [31]. Policymakers, the scientific community, and growers can better understand and manage emissions and identify mitigation measures that are coherent more with goals of the country’s food security and economic progression by estimating GHGE from cropping systems. [32,33]. In developing nations, agriculturalists are uninformed that unbalanced application of agricultural inputs can negatively impact the environment through GHGE [11] The impact on energy use and resultant GHGE significantly vary by crops and cropping system, management practices followed, climate indicators, and other factors [34]. For sustained agricultural productivity to ensure food security, and to develop the rural economy, energy plays a pivotal role in different sectors, among agriculture [7]. Further, energy auditing can be employed as a significant tool to eval­ uate agricultural products’ life cycle assessments, which becomes the initial level for recognizing the crop production leading to increasing efficiency [35–37]. Therefore, quantifying GHGE from various cropping systems may offer insightful understanding on how those systems affect the environment and enable farmers to choose smart management choices [38].
