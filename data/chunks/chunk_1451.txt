 Keywords: Hilltop farm, Irrigation, Jalkund, Water harvesting, Water security M EGHALAYA, one of the few hilly states in India, is characterized by its mountainous terrain, with more than two-thirds of the land covered by highland plateaus and intermountain valleys. The state experiences an annual average rainfall of 2,500 mm, predominantly during the southwest monsoon months (June-November), which accounts for nearly 70% of the rainfall. However, the post-monsoon period (October- March), which coincides with the rabi cropping season, remains largely dry, leading to significant water scarcity. This is particularly problematic as farmers, primarily cultivating high-value crops in the rainfed uplands, lack access to adequate irrigation facilities. With less than 10% of the agricultural area being irrigated, water scarcity has become the primary constraint for crop cultivation during the dry season, contributing to one of the lowest cropping intensities in the country. Despite Meghalaya’s abundant rainfall, the absence of efficient water harvesting and storage infrastructure has led to challenges in sustaining agriculture during the off-season. Water shortages not only affect agricultural productivity but also threaten the livelihood security of 80% of the state’s population dependent on agriculture. Given the limitations on horizontal expansion for crop cultivation, increasing cropping intensity through vertical expansion has become essential for meeting the region’s food demand and improving income generation. In this context, rainwater harvesting offers a viable solution to address the region’s water scarcity issues. To mitigate these challenges, ICAR has introduced a promising technology called Jalkund. This low-cost rainwater harvesting structure, made from a durable polythene sheet and installed in a dug-out pit, is designed to collect and store rainwater for use in agriculture and allied sectors such as livestock and fishery. Jalkund has been successfully demonstrated and adopted by many resource-poor farmers in Meghalaya, providing them with a reliable water source during the dry season. This stored water serves a variety of purposes, including crop irrigation, watering livestock, and washing produce. The implementation of Jalkund not only enhances land and crop productivity but also empowers tribal households by ensuring water security and promoting sustainable livelihoods. As rainwater harvesting technologies like Jalkund continue to gain traction, they offer a strategic pathway for reducing poverty and transforming the agrarian landscape in Meghalaya’s drought-prone hilly regions. Construction of Jalkund Jalkund is a micro-rainwater harvesting structure designed to be constructed on hilltops or in mid-hill areas, catering to the water needs of individual farm households.
