Indian Agriculture after Independence 138 2. Animal genetic resources India is a rich repository of animal genetic resources distributed widely over the diverse agro-climatic regions of the country with a total population of 536.76 million livestock and 851.81 million poultry (20th livestock Census, 2019). The livestock wealth of India includes 193.46 million cattle, 109.85 million buffaloes, 148.88 million goats, 74.26 million sheep, 9.16 million pigs and other species like horses and ponies (3.42 lakhs), camels (2.52 lakhs), mules (0.8 lakhs), mules and donkeys (1.24 lakhs), yak (0.58 lakhs), mithun (3.86 lakhs). The avian species includes 807.89 million fowls, 33.51 million ducks, 10.41 million turkeys and other poultry. Globally, India possesses largest buffalo population (49%), second largest population of cattle and goat, 3rd of sheep, 4th of duck, 5th of poultry and 6th of camel. Farmers of marginal, small and semi-medium operational holdings (area less than 4 ha) own about 87.7% of the livestock. 2.1. Characterization and registration of breeds Large proportion of non-descript animals of different species indicates that the characterization and inventorization of animal genetic resources of India is still incomplete. After establishment of National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources at Karnal by ICAR, phenotypic characteri- zation of domestic animal diversity of India has been accelerated. A system of registration of livestock and poultry breeds was initiated by ICAR in 2008 with the initial registration of 129 livestock and poultry populations as extant breeds. A total 73 new breeds were registered from 2010 to 2021. 2.2. Conservation of Animal Genetic Resources Conservation of Punganur cattle was taken up under National Agriculture Technology Project (NATP) by NBAGR, Karnal during 2000-2004 in collaboration with SVVU, Tirupati.
