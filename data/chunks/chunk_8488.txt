 The linseed-cake was soaked overnight in water. Molasses was heated in an open pan up to a temperature of 70°C to liquidize it and then mixed it with remaining ingredients. These ingredients were thoroughly mixed manually. The added moisture was adjusted at 20%, to have a proper binding of the material. The mixture was then processed in the IGFRI densifying machine hopper to get desired blocks. The complete feed-blocks of 31 cm × 31 cm × 50 cm were made, weighing 20 kg each, which can be easily handled by a single person. The machine had an output capacity of about 500 kg/hr with an average density of prepared bales as 400 kg/m3. A total of five labourers were required for the operation. The prepared blocks had 88.31% organic matter, 9.72% crude protein, 44.02% NDF, 31.11% ADF, 12.91% HC, 3.27% lignin and 11.69% ash. On-farm feeding trials of CFB were conducted in the nearby villages of Jhansi to assess the acceptability of the product. In 2 groups of buffaloes, one was fed with CFB and the second with the traditional material (wheat bhusa ad lib. and 2 kg concentrate). In addition, 5 kg green berseem was also fed to each animal. After one month of feeding CFB, 7 days' digestibility trial was also conducted. Feeding trials indicated that average dry matter (DM) intake/animal and average DM intake/100-kg body weight were similar in the group fed with CFB and the one with the traditional feeding system. The DM digestibility and average milk yield were, however, 9.15% and 19% higher in the group fed with CFB. Average milk fat content (8.3%) was similar in both groups. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 28 OILSEEDS GROUNDNUT Crop Improvement Four new varieties of groundnut have been identified for release. AK 159. An early-maturing (107 days) Spanish-bunch groundnut type, having high oil content (52%) and tolerance to thrips, has been identified for northern Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The pod and kernel yields realized were 1.79 and 1.18 tonnes/ ha respectively, which were 27 and 33% higher over the check variety TAG 24. Dh 86. It is a stable variety having high pod and kernel yields and tolerance to thrips. It has been identified for summer cultivation in Gujarat, southern Rajasthan and western Maharashtra and for rabi/summer cultivation in West Bengal, Jharkhand and Assam. JSP 28. It is a medium-duration, spreading genotype, having high oil content (52%). It has been identified for Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for kharif. It showed 16 and 28% higher pod and kernel yields over the check M 335. TG 41. It is a large-seeded (65g/100 kernels), early- (118–120 days) and uniform- maturing (sound mature kernel = 90%), erect genotype, having desirable confectionery qualities like high oleic/linoleic acid ratio (3 : 2) and high protein content (25%). It has been identified for all-India release.
