Further, if the farmer does not keep the field ready also, he loses the prime rainy days for tillage, which does not happen in research stations. However, if there is delay in receiving rainfall, even with small rainfall like <l/2 capacity also all the farmers sow the sorghum+ pigeonpea crop. In Nallavelli of Yacharam mandal of Ranga Reddy district of Andhra Pradesh, it was recorded that when the rainfall received in indigenous rain- gauge ranged from 1/2 to full, which was about 8- 33 mm in standard rain-gauge, it resulted in 100% sowing of sorghum+ pigeonpea crops in the farmers' fields. It was observed that the rainfall received in indigenous rain-gauge when corrected was nearer to the recorded rainfall of standard rain-gauge. The variation decreased from 30% to 18%, which shows the improved precision towards the optimum requirement of water for sowing operation. When the indigenous rain-gauge was full, sorghum+ pigeonpea were sown by all the farmers within 3 days. Therefore it fulfills the claim made by the discloser. However, under some conditions as mentioned above, when the rainfall is low in quantity and late in the season, the claim is vitiated. Castor In castor crop, 1/2 to 3/4th filling of the indigenous rain-gauge with the rain water led to sowing of castor by all the farmers from 1-5 days, as this is a commercial crop of this Telangana region and is suitable for late sowing or for delayed rainfall conditions. Overflow events Data presented in Table 3 indicate the probability of receiving the overflowing rainfall events over 33 years (1971-2003) for each month. The overflowing rainfall events depend on the Table 3.
