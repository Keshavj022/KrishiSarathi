 The major research outputs of the institute are: breeding of over 66 improved varieties, seed plot technique, national potato seed production programme and scheduling zone-wise agro-techniques. The major outcome of the scheme is 32.68 fold increase in production, 9.35 fold increase in area and 3.54 fold increase in yield during last seven decades. The area, yield and production in 1949-50 (the year of establishment of ICAR-CPRI) was 0.23 million ha, 6.59 t/ha and 1.54 million tonnes, respectively. As per 3rd Advance Estimate of DAC&FW, India produced 53.03 million tonnes of potato from 2.16 million ha area with an average yield of 24.55 t/ha in 2018-19. Potato is an economically important staple food in both developed and developing countries because of its high yield potential, high nutritive value, easy digestibility and wholesome nature. It contains high protein-calorie ratio (17 g protein:1000 kcal) and yields more edible energy, protein and dry matter per unit area and time compared to cereal crops. The glycemic index (a measure of the effects of carbohydrates on blood sugar) of boiled potato is 56 (medium) compared to 58 in white rice and 71 in white bread. Therefore, it is a misconception that potato causes obesity and is forbidden for diabetic patient. Potato area and production China is the top potato producing country in the world followed by India and Russian Federation. Compared to the area, production and productivity in 1949-50, the increase over this period is 9, 33 and 3.6 fold, respectively. The main potato growing regions in the country are the North Indian plains (86%) followed by Plateau (8%) and hills (6%), which are divided into eight zones. Impact of potato technology Agriculture, including allied activities, contributed 13.9% of the GDP at constant prices (2004-05) in 2013-14, and this sector still accounts for 54.6% of total employment in the country. Current share of potato to agricultural GDP is 2.86% out of 1.32% cultivable area. On the contrary, Prospects Marchâ€“April 2023 57 Table 1.
