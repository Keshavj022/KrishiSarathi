 Application of endophytes is beneficial for groundnut cultivation in salinity affected areas and more salinity affected areas can be brought under cultivation with the help of endophytes in future. 6. Contact: Director, ICAR-Directorate of Groundnut Research, Ivnagar Road, PB No. 5, Junagadh-362001 42 M i c r o b e B a s e d T e c h n o l o g i e s D e v e l o p e d b y I C A R Microbial biopolymer for smart farming 1. Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/ species): Microbially derived biopolymer is a metabolic product of a Rhizobium sp. associated with halophytic weed Psoralea corylifolia L. The product is a carbohydrate-rich polymer, having excellent gelability, heat stability, and has diversity of reactive functional groups that can interact with variety of metal ions including micronutrients. Further the product has unique ability to induce microbial colonization, which is an important aspect for sound crop performance and soil health. The product is completely green in nature, and undergoes microbial decomposition in soil environment. 2. Target crops and delivery system: The biopolymer is suitable for use in variety of crops including cereals, millets, legumes, vegetables, spices, and oilseed crops. Application of the biopolymer can be done through foliar spray, drip-irrigation system, seed-treatment, root-dipping for seedlings. 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): All 4. Validation and commercialization: The technology has been validated for sorghum, soybean, maize, brinjal, onion, fenugreek, at ICAR-NIASM headquarters. 5. Whether licensed to private companies, If yes, details thereof: A patent application (3127/ MUM/2015) has been filed for ‘Development of a Microbially Derived Polymeric Product for Gel formation, Microbial Colonization, and Metals Binding’. The technology is yet to be transferred to the interested companies. 6. Benefits:The biopolymer has shown promising response in different crops under drought conditions. Further, it has demonstrated significant capacity to induce rhizosphere colonization by different beneficial microbes such as nitrogen fixers, siderophore producers, and exopolysaccharides producers. The product has promoted nodule formation in soybean. Overall, the biopolymer has great applicability under drought conditions where moisture is critical factor for survival of the plants. Additionally, the biopolymer has shown significant influence on soil microbiota, which is a critical factor for maintaining soil health in long term. 7.
