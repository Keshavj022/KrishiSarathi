 By encouraging regional collaboration and implementing proactive measures, the system aims to create a resilient framework that protects agricultural ecosystems and promotes sustainable farming practices. The key objectives of the National Early Warning & Rapid Response System are centered around proactive weed management. Firstly, the system aims to prevent the introduction and establishment of quarantine weeds, focusing on measures that hinder their entry and proliferation. Secondly, an emphasis is placed on early detection and reporting, empowering swift responses to emerging invasive weed threats. The system prioritizes eradication or containment efforts immediately following the establishment of invasive species to minimize their impact. Additionally, a crucial aspect involves regional collaboration for prevention and mitigation, fostering a collective approach to weed management for more effective outcomes. Ecological impacts caused by invasive weed Strategies for controlling invasive and quarantine weeds Management of invasive weeds Indian Farming 30 February 2024 Control of major invasive weeds Parthenium hysterophorus (Congress grass, white top, goat weed, Gajar Ghans): Various strategies can be employed for the control of Parthenium hysterophorus, a problematic weed. One biological approach involves the use of the Chrysomelid beetle (Zygogramma bicolorata), which has shown effectiveness in controlling Parthenium populations. Additionally, the application of pathogens such as Fusarium pallidoroseum and Sclerotium rolfsii, targeting different parts of the Parthenium plant, has proven to be a viable control method. Chemical methods also play a role in managing Parthenium. The use of herbicides such as Bromacil, Diuron, and Terbacil at a rate of 1.5 Kg/ha has demonstrated efficacy. Alternatively, Diquat at 0.5 Kg/ha, applied at all stages of Parthenium growth, has shown effective control. For seedling control, herbicides like 2,4-D Na salt or MCPA at a rate of 2 Kg/ha have been found to be successful. These integrated approaches provide a comprehensive strategy for effectively managing and controlling the growth of Parthenium hysterophorus. Chromolaena odorata (devil weed or Siam Weed): Effective control measures involve a combination of physical, chemical, and biological methods. In highly infested areas, manual slashing and the use of bush cutters or tractor- drawn implements are employed as physical methods to clear and reduce the weedâ€™s biomass. For chemical control, Ticlopyr has proven to be the most effective herbicide against Chromolaena odorata. Additionally, the spraying of a mixture containing 2,4-D Amine and Picloram, particularly after the removal of flower heads, has been found to effectively kill the top growth of the weed. Biological control methods have also shown promise. The larvae of Pareuchaetes pseudoinsulata are known to effectively defoliate pure stands of Chromolaena odorata, contributing to its control.
