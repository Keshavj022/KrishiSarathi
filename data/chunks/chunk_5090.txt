 Copper which is an important ingredient of fungicide was not found in sufficient quantity in this soil to show any sort of fungicidal action. The other soil properties were pH 5.3, EC 0.059, Carbon Table 2. Preference of individuals for the ITK vs chaubatia paste Criterion Preference for ITK (yellow soil paste) Preference for chaubatia paste Number 14 35 Percentage 29 71 Table 3. Percentage of infection under different sets of treatments Treatment Percentage of infection Before treatment imposition (December 2002) After treatment imposition (August 2003) Recovery (%) T1 Chaubatia paste 44.50 16.86 62.1 T2 Lime + sulphur 28.75 13.47 53.1 T3 Lime + sulphur + kerosene 27.50 11.02 59.9 T4 Yellow soil paste (ITK practice) 48.75 43.37 11.0 T5 Yellow soil + kerosene 32.50 26.13 19.6 T6 Yellow soil + lime + sulphur 36.25 17.78 50.9 T7 Control 35.00 57.12 - CD for recovery (P=0.05).  HORTICULTURAL CROPS 0.162%, N 0.048%, DTPA-Zn 0.09%, DTPA-Fe 13.4 ppm and DTPA-Mn 3.24%. CONCLUSION The results of the experiment indicate that yellow soil provides a sort of protective layer around the wound, which may prevent the entry of the pathogen as only 11.0% recovery was observed by using paste of yellow soil.  HORTICULTURAL CROPS Code : 1162 Title of the ITK : Raising of cucurbitaceous crop in sand dunes under water scarcity conditions Description of the ITK : In south western districts of Punjab, specially in Muktsar and Faridkot, a number of sand dunes are prevalent which are uncultivable and there is no facility of irrigation water. The underground water in brackish is natural. About 100 families, mostly muslim, utilize these sand dunes for raising cucurbits (long melon, water melon, musk,melon and pumpkin) taking the lands on lease from the land lords. The farmers dig trenches on sand dunes, which are 6 feet deep and 3 feet wide. The trenches are dug apart at a distance of 4 feet. In some cases the depth of the trenches is at the point where moisture is available. Two to three seeds of cucurbits are sown at a distance of 1 foot in October_November. Farm-yard manure @ 12 tonnes/acre is applied before sowing. The seeds are covered with soil after sowing. The farmers go on putting soil with the germinating seedlings and bring the plants up to the surface of the soil, leaving the roots at a depth of about 6 feet below in moist zone. During February, sponge gourd is sown in the trenches by dibbling. The cucurbits, sown in October_November, come to bearing in March and the vines are dried up in the month of June). eanwhile fruiting starts on sponge gourd, which continues up to October. The process thus restarts. Prepared trench for cultivation of cucurbit in sand dunes Name and address of the discloser : Shri Mohammad Amir Kadri C/o Malkit Auto Service Bus Stand Bhange Wali P.O.
