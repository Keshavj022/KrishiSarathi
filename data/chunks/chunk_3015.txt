 Seed Pelleting and planting method: • Trials conducted on seed pelleting and methods of planting on onion at NRC (O&G) showed that higher yield i.e., 25.6 t/ha with the maximum C:B ratio i.e.,1:2.40 was recorded with the pelleting of Trichoderma viridae @ 4g/kg seed under flat bed system in Kharif planting. The same treatment is recommended for rabi season also. VIII. Planting date and spacing: • At faizabad, the maximum ~ield (22.45 t/ha) and C:B ratio 1:4.89 of broccoli cv. Fiesta was obtained by 15t October planting at spacing of 45 x 30 cm. Hence, this date of planting and spacing is recommended for Faizabad conditions. www.icar.org.in 36 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Horticulture • At Ranchi, transplanting of broccoli in October from 15_30th at 45x30 cm spacing recorded the maximum mean yield and C:B ratio 1:4.89. Hence, this date of planting and spacing is recommended for Ranchi conditions. IX. Fertilization studies: • At NRC (OG), the application ofNPK @ 50:50:80 kglha as basal + 100 kg N in seven split through drip irrigation expressed better yield (29.6 t/ha) and highest C:B ratio i.e., 1: 1.63 in onion. Whereas for garlic application ofNPK @ 50:50:50 kglha as basal + 50 kg N in seven split through drip irrigation gave yield of 7.91 tonnes I ha with maximum C:B ratio 1:2.93. Hence, it is recommended for Pune conditions of Maharastra. Recommendation for 2006‐07 Protected cultivation • Under polyhouse production of capsicum hybrid Indra, based on highest yield (9.64 kglm2) and cost: benefit ratio (1 :6.56); spacing of 60 X 30 cm without training is recommended under naturally ventilated polyhouse under terai conditions of Pantnagar. • In naturally ventilated polyhouse, maximum yield (1399.64 qlha) along with highest C:B ratio 1:3.92 in hybrid tomato cv. Tolstoy was obtained with double stem training at 50 X 20 cm spacing. Hence it is recommended for Varanasi conditions. • In naturally ventilated polyhouse, the maximum C:B ratio 1:2.27 along with higher yield 451.55 qlha was recorded in capsicum hybrid Indra with the treatment combination of 60 X 30 cm plant spacing without pruning. Hence, it is recommended for Varanasi conditions. Weed Control • For weed management in onion, application of oxyfluorfen @ 0.15 kg a:lha as PE resulted in highest yield (11.26 tlha) and C:B ratio (l :3.40). Hence, it is recommended for Coimbatore conditions. Use of Biofertilizer • Root dipping of tomato seedlings with Azotobactor along with 75 per cent N + 100 per cent PK recorded highest fruit yield (635.38 qlha) and C:B ratio (l :3:26). Hence it is recommended for Srinagar conditions. • Under Coimbatore conditions, seedling root dip with the Azospirillum in addition to 75% N + 100% PK recommended resulted in highest yield 427.2 qlha along with the maximum C:B ratio of 1:4: 11 in tomato. Hence, it is recommended for Coimbatore conditions. www.icar.org.in 37 2002‐2007 Integrated Nutrient Management Tomato • At Hisar, the maximum mean yield (432.
