 Soil Science INTEGRATED NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT IN RICE Nutrient components for INM Requirements per hectare Fertilizer Urea: 100 kg; DAP: 90 kg and MOP: 50 Biofertilizer (Azospirillum) 2-3 kg Manure (FYM/Compost) 30 – 40 tons For efficient fertilizer use yy Use organic fertilizer (manure, compost, straw, husk, plant leaves) whenever possible especially in nurseries. 129 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy Apply all P, K, and 10% N evenly and incorporate just before seeding or transplanting. For direct seeded broadcast crops, it is okay to apply 10–14 days after establishment when there is water in the field. yy Apply remaining N (urea) in 2 equal portions at 30 days and 50–60 days (panicle initiation) after emergence. yy In established crops, apply chemical fertilizer only in standing water and evenly across the whole field. yy Do not apply high rates of fertilizer for traditional varieties as they may have limited response and cause lodging. yy Do not use chemical fertilizer if you need more than 5 kg paddy to pay for 1 kg of fertilizer. yy Inorganic fertilizers must be stored in a dry and cool place that is out of children’s reach Water management Water availability largely determines the potential crop yield. For a crop to continue to grow, the water supply needs to be similar or a little above evaporation. In an efficient system, each 1 kg of grain produced will require a minimum of 2,000 liters or 2 m³ of water. Good water control increases crop yields and grain quality as well as improving the efficiency of other inputs such as fertilizer, herbicide, and pesticides. yy To maximize water-use efficiency: yy Maintain the bunds; yy Level the fields; yy Puddle the fields where possible; yy Use direct-seeding techniques; yy Use short-duration crops; and yy Harvest on time. 130 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS MEGHALAYA Paddy yy Prepare nursery for kharif paddy variety Sahsharang, RCM 10, CAU R1 (about 500-1000 sq. meter) for raising seedlings for one hectare area (40kg HYVseeds/ha). yy Use FYM and Vermicompost in nursery beds yy Seed treatment with Trichoderma harzianum @5g/kg seeds yy Drenching of the nursery with Trichoderma harzianum @5g/l of water before sowing yy Trichoderma harzianum @ 2.5kg + 50 kg FYM. 10-15 days before sowing seeds in nursery yy Prepare main paddy field for 2-3 ploughing with power tiller and mix FYM 5t/ha at ploughing yy Transplant paddy with about 20-25days old seedlings at 20 x 15 cm spacing. yy Spraying of neem oil @ 3 ml/l at 10DAT yy Release of Trichogramma japonicum @ 50000 eggs /ha 35 DAT yy One spray of Beauveria bassiana @ 7g/l at boot leaf stage. Maize yy Maize sowing at 60x30 cm spacing should be done with HYV variety RCM 75, RCM 76, RCM 1-3 or intercropping with Dwarf French bean (var.
