 The authors found that the orange peels added to BPs enhanced the growth and yield parameters more than the pomegranate peels added to BPs. Applying these organic fertilizers at both basal and topdressing times significantly contributed to the increase in the growth and yield parameters. The performance of a composite of banana and orange peels has been contrasted with moringa oliefera extracts and NPK fertilizer [77]. The study proved that BPs combined with orange peels have great potential as a fertilizer for the enhanced growth and yield of Solanum scabrum Mill. The methodology involved sun-drying, powdering, and sieving the peels individually. A mixed powder containing 40 g of each dried peel was used throughout their investigation. The fruit peel waste was applied every two weeks at a rate of 200 kg/ha at the base of the plants, with daily irrigation. The authors observed that the number of leaves on the plants was more significantly enhanced by the fruit peels than the NPK (20:10:10) fertilizer and Moringa treatments. Furthermore, a higher shoot height was obtained from the plants treated with the blended peels, as shown in Table 5. The authors attribute this to the high contents of potassium and calcium found in banana and orange peels, which promote the movement of water and nutrients. The other plant growth parameters that were investigated were the root length, leaf area, and plant freshness. In some parameters, such as the plant’s fresh weight, the NPK fertilizer performed better than the fruit peels because of the high moisture content in NPK-treated plants. However, compared with the parameters of the control plants, such as the number of leaves, leaf size, and total leaf area, the fruit peels’ performance soared due to the presence of phosphorus [77]. A composite of the Moringa leaves and banana peels would have also generated valuable information in this study. Table 5. Studies of the use of composites containing banana peels as fertilizers.
