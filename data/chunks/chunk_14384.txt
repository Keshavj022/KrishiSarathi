 Bivariate analysis serves as an initial exploration of relationships between individual variables without considering the influence of other factors. The Chi-Square test has been adopted for the validity check. Further, the binomial Logistic Regression Model has been used for this study. Logistic regression modelling is a suitable method for analyzing the relationship between multiple independent variables (such as socio- economic, demographic and migration characteristics) and a binary outcome variable. It allows for controlling the effects of confounding variables and quantifying the impact of each predictor variable on the likelihood of specific outcomes. In this study, using a binomial logistic regression model enables us to investigate how different socio- economic, demographic and migration characteristics of migrants in­ fluence the likelihood of remittance utilization in agriculture. Stata 14.1 software tool has been used for data analysis. 4. Results Determining the background characteristics of the study population is crucial because the variation of sociodemographic characteristics between individuals who participate and those who do not in population-based studies can introduce bias and diminish the applica­ bility of any research results (Vo et al., 2023). Therefore, relevant so­ cioeconomic, demographic and migration characteristics which can influence the utilization of remittances have been selected for the pre­ sent study. Table 1 provides a brief background characteristic of the study population. In terms of age distribution, the majority of migrants fall within the age range of 46–60 years (31.91 %), followed by those aged less than 30 years (24.28 %), 31–45 years (25.16 %), and more than 60 years (18.64 %). Regarding the sex of the household head, a higher proportion of households are headed by females (61.3 %) compared to males (38.7 %). Caste category distribution reveals that a significant portion of migrants belong to Other Backward Classes (OBCs) (55.19 %), followed by S. Sarkar and R. R.S. Research in Globalization 9 (2024) 100235 5 Scheduled Castes (SCs) (23.19 %), Others (19.22 %), and Scheduled Tribes (STs) (2.4 %). In terms of education, the majority of migrants are illiterate (58.05 %), while smaller proportions have completed primary (13.77 %), secondary (20.19 %), or higher secondary education and above (7.98 %). Landholding patterns show that a considerable pro­ portion of migrants have no land (55.8 %), while others own less than 1 acre (30.04 %) or more than 1 acre (14.16 %). Regarding employment, a significant portion of migrants are engaged in private salaried work (44.99 %), followed by casual wage labour (48.22 %), self-employment (3.4 %), government salaried work (3.26 %), and unpaid family work (0.13 %). Nuclear families constitute the majority (60.29 %), and re­ mittances are primarily sent monthly (63.99 %), with wives being the most common receivers (58.44 %).
