Methods The present study explores the gendered perspective of agricultural decision-making in one of the eastern states of India, i.e., Odisha. In order to achieve the objective, the functional form as specified in equation 1 is estimated for six different gender-based decisions on agricultural activities of the households. Since we have six different gender-based decisions on agricultural activities of the households (Table 2), we shall have a system of equations (rather than a single equation) to estimate and analyse. However, the Classical Linear Regression (CLR) technique cannot be used here, as the dependent variables are categorical. In such cases, even the nonlinear least square method of estimation cannot address this issue [49]. Thus, the appro­ priate econometric technique to deal with such data is through Multi­ nomial Logit Models (MLM), which could be explained as: Suppose we have the following model: Y∗ i = ∑ k n=1 BnXin + ui where Y∗ i is unobserved, the Xs are the regressors and ui the error term.Y∗ i is often known as a latent or index variable. Although we cannot observe it directly, the latent variable depends on one or more re­ gressors. Further suppose we have n independent individuals (or ob­ servations) and they face J-ordered alternatives, such that, Yi = 1, if Y∗ i ≤a1, Yi = 2, if a1 ≤Y∗ i ≤a2, Yi = 3, if a2 ≤Y∗ i ≤a3, Yi = J, if aj−1 ≤Y∗ i , where a1 < a2 < a3… < aJ−1, i.e., we observe an individual Yi in one of the J ordered categories, these categories being separated by the threshold parameters or cutoffs, the as’. The method of estimation is by the method of maximum likelihood. The underlying estimation principle is simple; we want to estimate, Pr(Yi ≤j) = Pr ( B1 XIJ + B2X2i + … + BKXki + ui ≤aj ) = Pr ( ui ≤aj −B1 X1i −B2 X2i −… −Bk Xki ) It gives the (cumulative) probability that Yi falls in a category j and below (i.e., in category 1, 2... or j). To compute the probability that a random variable takes a value equal to or less than a given number, we use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of probability distribution. To make the interpretation easier, we can make use of the odds ratio as. Pr[Yi≤j|X] Pr[Yi>j|X] = Pr[Yi≤j|X] Pr[1−Pr(Yi≤j|X)], where, Pr[Yi≤j|X] = ∑j m=1Pr[Yi = m|X]. The MLM also provides the relative risk ratios (RRR) for each of the inde­ pendent variables [22]. Estimation of MLM is done through statistical software STATA 13.0 edition [12,43]. Table 2 presents the descriptions of the dependent and independent variables used in the study. The Human development index for female (HDIF) is computed by taking the weighted arithmetic mean (the weights being uniform) of three indicators.
