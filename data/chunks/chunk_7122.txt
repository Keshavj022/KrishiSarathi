 Management of nursery diseases in vegetables using new fungicides: Drenching of Fenamidone + Mancozeb @ 0.25% in the nursery has been standardized and recommended in chilli variety G 4 and LCA 334 and tomato variety Arka Vikas. Integrated management of vector borne virus diseases of chilli: For integrated management of vector borne virus diseases of chilli (at Lam, Bhubaneswar, Hessaraghatta, Parbhani and Coimbatore), application of neem cake (1 kg/m2) in the seed bed, seed treatment (8 g/kg seed) with imidacloprid, spraying (1.8 ml/l) of cyazpyr at two to three days before transplanting, seedling dip (0.5 ml/l) with imidacloprid and growing of two rows Disease Index in plastic mulched plants CROP MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 86 combination consisting of the use of seed pro @ 10 g/kg seed for seed treatment and application of soil solarization to soil bed followed by incorporation of 5 kg FYM fortified with 500 g neem cake and 50 g Trichoderma sp.+ 50 g Paecilomyces lilacinus at the time of bed preparation when combined with periodic spray and drenching of Phyton @ 4 ml/l, three times at 15 days interval beginning from 30 days after transplanting proved most effective in limiting all diseases like collar rot/root rot, powdery mildew and YLCV. Fruit yield of coloured capsicum was 663.95 q/ha and B:C ratio 9.99. IDM packages for cucurbit diseases: At Lam (Ridge gourd cv. Local), Junagadh (Bottle gourd cv. Pusa Naveen), Parbhani (Cucumber cv. Pune Khira) and Sabour integrated management practice module involving growing of two rows of maize as border crops and use of agri-silver mulch sheet followed by seed treatment with carbendazim 12% + mancozeb 63% @ 3 g/kg and drenching of captan 70% + hexaconazole 5% WP @ 0.1% 15 days after germination followed by spraying of tebuconazole 50% + trifloxystrobin 25% @ 1 g/l + spray with (imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 7.5 ml/15 l + neem oil 0.2%) followed by fosetyl-Al @ 0.1% at 10 days interval was highly effective in reducing severity of damping off, Alternaria leaf blight, Cercospora leaf spot, downy mildew and mosaic diseases. Pesticide residue analysis for this treatment revealed that no pesticide was detected. The B:C ratio ranged between 1:1.3 to 1:17.9. Integrated disease management in bitter gourd: At Vellanikkara, Kerala for the integrated management of diseases of bitter gourd, seed treatment with Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% @ 3 g/kg and drenching with Captan 70% + Hexaconazole 5% WP @ 0.1% at 1st true leaf emergence stage after germination, followed by 5â€“6 spraying of Seed Pro (1%) at 10 days interval in rotation with neem oil (0.2%) alternatively after 15 days after drenching with a B:C ratio of 1.78:1 has been standardized. Management of late blight of potato: Spray schedule of mancozeb 75% @ 0.2% (before the appearance of disease) followed by azoxystrobin 11.5% + mancozeb 30% WP @ 0.25% (at the onset of disease) and one more spray of azoxystrobin 11.5% + mancozeb 30% WP @ 0.
