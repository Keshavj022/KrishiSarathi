 There was a remarkable increase in the number of candidates preferring Community Science (previously Home Science) which was evident by the fact that 50% seats in the subject were filled during 2019-20 in comparison to only 3% seats filled-up during 2014-15. The change in nomenclature of this degree programme might have been one of the reasons for attracting more number of candidates towards this discipline. State-wise number of candidates admitted The top five states from which the candidates were recommended for admission were Rajasthan with 408 candidates followed by Bihar (402), Kerala (260), Odisha (170) and Andhra Pradesh (149). From the states like Gujarat (2), Assam (5), Erstwhile Jammu & Kashmir (5), Punjab (7), Uttarakhand (8), Maharashtra (9), Karnataka (15), Tamil Nadu (16), the number of admitted candidates was very low. Out of 36 states/UTs, the eight states/UTs namely Mizoram, Sikkim, Nagaland, Chandigarh, Lakshadweep, Puducherry, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, and Daman & Diu, remained unrepresented. Out of the total 2,189 candidates granted provisional admission, 1,018 (46.5%) were female candidates. Out of 260 candidates admitted from Kerala, the highest number of 212 (81.5%) candidates were girls (Table-6). It may be observed that the female candidates from Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andaman & Nicobar Islands (U.T.), Chhattisgarh, Delhi (U.T.), Goa, Erstwhile Jammu & Kashmir, Manipur and Meghalaya also outnumbered male candidates for admission to UG programmes.
