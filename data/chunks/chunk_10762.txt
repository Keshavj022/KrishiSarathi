 Nursery Area & preparation:   A well-drained area of 1/20th of the area to be transplanted is selected for nursery (For one- hectare land, a nursery area of one kanal (500 m2) is required)   Plough the nursery area 2-3 times and puddle it in 2-3cm of water.   The nursery beds should be 1.0-1.5 meters in width and of any convenient length.   Broadcast pre-germinated seeds uniformly in seed bed and maintain 2-3cm of water till pre- germinated seeds are established in the bed.   In case any disease symptom is observed in nursery, spray with Tricyclazole 75WP @ 0.06% (0.6g per liter water).   One or two drainage periods of 12-24 hours are beneficial during first few days of nursery establishment.   Protected nursery under a polythene tunnel is recommended when night temperature falls below 10oC. Remove the polythene cover during sunny days. Seed rate:   3 kg per kanal for transplanted rice in lower belts and   4 kg per kanal for higher belts of the valley. Seed treatment:   Pre-sowing treatment by overnight soaking of seeds in 0.06% suspension of Tricyclazole 75 WP or 0.1% Carbendazim 50WP is highly recommended.   Soak the seeds in water for 24 hours and incubate for 36 to 48 hours.   Seeds should not be over-sprouted. Length of the sprout shall be less than the length of grain itself. Manure & fertilizer:   Apply 1.5-2 kg well decomposed farmyard manure plus 0.5 kg of ash/m2 of nursery area for better growth of seedling and building soil quality.   Also apply 275g Urea, 450g DAP and 200g MOP per marla (25 m2) of nursery as basal dose. Transplanting:   Apply 250g Urea per marla as top dose ten days before uprooting the nursery.   The transplanting should be completed between last week of May to 2nd week of June when the rice seedling is 28-30 days old.   Any delay in transplanting beyond this date results in a significant yield decline.
