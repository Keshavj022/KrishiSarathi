In this study only mild anti-microbial activity against Staph, aureus could be recorded. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against other bacteria. Therapeutic efficacy of bael fruit: Results of experiments conducted at IVRI are presented in Tables 4-6. The diarrhoeic calves of Gr II that received bael-fruit powder (ITK) together with standard antibiotic treatment showed better improvement than those of Gr I (without ITK) in terms of faecal consistency, depression and dehydration (based on clinical assessment and PCV). The result showed that the values of different haemato- biochemical parameters improved markedly to almost normal level by day 3 in animals of Gr II, whereas the animals of Gr I still continued to pass loose faeces and had mild depression and dehydration by day 3. Thus, the calves of Gr II had a faster recovery than those of Gr I, indicating significant supportive therapeutic effect of bael powder in diarrhoea. These results are in conformity with those of the previous year. Contents VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Table 6.
