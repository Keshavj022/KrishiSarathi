 The addition of crop residues has been observed to rapidly enhance microbial activity, improving the soil’s ecological environment. Microbial communities, integral to soil ecosystem processes and biogeochemical cycles, are influenced positively by crop residue returning. The increased organic matter content in the soil provides an optimal environment for the growth and proliferation of microorganisms. In conclusion, the incorporation of rice residues in situ significantly influences soil biological properties, shaping the dynamics of both macro- and micro-fauna, and microbial communities. Understanding these reduced surface runoff and direct evaporation from surface, enhances soil saturated water conductivity and improves water infiltration in the soil profile. The straw coverage on the soil surface can effectively reduce topsoil temperatures affecting the evaporation and thus enhance soil moisture content. The higher moisture availability in soil add to water holding of soil and availability of moisture for better crop productivity. Bulk density: The bulk density of soil becomes low with enhanced management of rice residues which signifies an improvement in porosity and soil aeration and ultimately in soil structure. The different crops residue and their management have differential effect on soil bulk density across soil profiles and growth periods. Porosity and aggregate stability: Positive effect of chopped and crushed crop residue incorporation in soil have been reported on soil porosity and aggregate stability. The organic matter addition through crop residues contributes to formation of larger and more stable soil aggregates. It helps in maintaining soil structure and nutrient cycling. Soil’s chemical properties The in situ management of rice residues significantly influences various soil chemical properties, contributing to improved soil health and enhanced crop productivity. pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC): Crop residues play a crucial role in regulating soil pH, particularly in soils with low buffering capacity. Incubation experiments have demonstrated that the ameliorating effects of crop straw decayed products can lead to a substantial increase in soil pH. However, certain practices, such as straw coverage with no-till and rotary tillage, may result in a reduction in soil pH. Additionally, crop residue management has a pronounced impact on cation exchange capacity (CEC). Accumulation of soil organic matter in crop residues generates more negative charges, leading to increased CEC. Studies have shown that higher crop residue retention levels correspond to significantly higher CEC, emphasizing the importance of residue management in influencing soil chemistry. Organic carbon and soil nutrient content: Decaying crop residues are integral components of the nutrient cycle, contributing to increased levels of organic carbon, nitrogen, available phosphorus, and potassium in the soil.
