 Consensus was achieved on several over-arching issues, including the need to ensure that agricultural production is sustainable through better natural resource management; manage scarce water resources efficiently through collaboration on policy instruments and on-farm management; research agricultural interventions for rehabilitation of degraded or contaminated agricultural lands; ensure technical and economic research addresses storage and distribution of chain efficiencies for major crops; address increased demand for livestock and fish products arising from increased incomes; raise farmers’ incomes and improve nutrition through agricultural diversification; raise quality of agricultural products and opportunities raised through collaboration on products processing; embrace opportunities offered by collaboration on applications of biotechnologies and new information technologies; and link results of research into existing and emerging extension networks. The indicative priorities will go a long way in developing proposals for research in collaboration in (i) Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Development Policy, (ii) Crop Sciences, (iii) Animal Sciences, (iv) Agroforestry, (v) Fisheries, (vi) Land and Water Management, and (vii) Post-harvest Technology.
