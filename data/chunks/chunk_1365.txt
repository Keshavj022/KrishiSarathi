 Additional maize grain was used to prepare flour for family consumption in the form of chapatis and satu. In the first year, the FLDs were conducted at one location, and in 2024, two additional villages were included in the FLD program. The farmers expressed their gratitude to KVK-Kupwara, DARS Rangreth, SKUAST-K, and the collaborating institute ICAR-Indian Institute of Maize Research, Punjab, for introducing this technology, which has improved their economic status, livelihood security, and net profits. Lessons learned Cultivation of the quality protein maize variety LQMH-1 can significantly boost farmers’ income. Capacity-building initiatives for farmers will support the adoption of improved technologies. Since most maize is grown as a rainfed crop, the introduction of low-cost rainwater harvesting structures would further enhance production. CONCLUSION The introduction of the Quality Protein Maize (QPM) variety LQMH-1 in Kupwara district has proven effective in increasing farmers’ income and securing their food and nutritional needs. By demonstrating higher yields—70 quintals/ha compared to 30 quintals/ha under traditional practices—the program has enabled farmers to realize significant economic benefits while also producing quality fodder for livestock. This success has led to widespread adoption of QPM, with more farmers in Gushi, Batergam, and Bramri villages joining the initiative. In addition to increased income, the surplus maize produced is used by families as a nutritious staple, providing further benefits. Farmers have expressed gratitude for the training and technology support from KVK-Kupwara, DARS Rangreth, and SKUAST-K, which has improved their livelihoods and demonstrated the value of quality seeds and sustainable practices. The project’s success underscores the potential of targeted agricultural interventions in enhancing rural economic stability. *Corresponding author email: raies@skuastkashmir.ac.in Water • Even though households are relatively low consumers of water, population growth and expanded water use have outweighed the effect of water saving technology and behavior. • Less than 3% of the world’s water is fresh (drinkable), of which 2.5% is frozen in the Antarctica, Arctic and glaciers. Humanity must therefore rely on 0.5% for all of man’s ecosystem’s and fresh water needs. • Man is polluting water faster than nature can recycle and purify water in rivers and lakes. More than one billion people still do not have access to fresh water. • Excessive use of water contributes to the global water stress. Water is free from nature but the infrastructure needed to deliver it is expensive. - See more at: http://www.unep.org/wed/theme water.asp#sthash.ki5vg3lB.dpuf Courtesy: United Nations Environment Programme website - http://www.unep.
