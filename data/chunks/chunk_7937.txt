 This suggested that RT LAMP based absorbance assay could be used as an indicator to measure the degree of bovine HSP70 transcripts produced during thermal stress and be used as an alternative to the traditional real time PCR assay. Genetic polymorphism of heat shock protein genes: The study was conducted to investigate the expression profile of two important nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain receptors (NLRs) (NOD1 and NOD2) and their central signalling molecule RIP2 gene during in vitro thermal-stressed bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of native (Sahiwal) and crossbred (Sahiwal × HF) cattle. The findings revealed that the expression patterns during thermal stress were comparatively superior among indigenous compared to crossbred cattle, which may add references regarding the better immune adaptability of zebu cattle. Burgur buffalo: The Burgur buffaloes were genetically characterized using 24 loci of neutral microsatellite markers. All the loci studied in the population are polymorphic. Overall average number of alleles was 8±0.55 and average effective number of alleles 3.85±0.25. The average observed (Ho) and unbiased expected (uHe) heterozygosity were 0.66±0.04 and 0.71±0.032 for Burgur buffaloes. The observed heterozygosity in the studied population was lower than the expected heterozygosity. FIS value was 0.056±0.037. Microsatellite diversity analysis revealed no recent bottle neck in the Burgur buffalo and gives L-shaped curve. Murrah: The FCGRT gene in Murrah buffaloes was found to be polymorphic for intron-1 with MseI, exon-3 with BbvI , exon-7 with HpaII RE using PCR- RFLP analysis. The coding region SNPs were nonsynonymous and led to amino acid change. The association of exon3 polymorphs of dams was significant between the high and the low colostral IgG groups. Mouli and Yalaga sheep: Genetic diversity study, using FAO recommended microsatellite markers, was carried out in the Mouli and Yalaga sheep populations of Karnataka. The values for effective number of alleles, mean observed heterozygosity and gene diversity were 5.23, 0.637 and 0.783 in Mouli and 4.865, 0.596 and 0.757 in Yalaga sheep, respectively. A normal L-shaped curve under Mode shift test suggested absence of a recent reduction in the effective population size or a genetic bottleneck. Nagaland goats: Microsatellite based genetic diversity of Nagaland goats was carried out using 25 markers recommended by FAO. The observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.043 to 0.786 with an overall mean of 0.347±0.040, whereas, effective hetrozygosity ranged from 0.045 to 0.815 with an overall mean of 0.499±0.051. The difference between the observed and expected heterozygosity revealed possibility of inbreeding. This is reflected by the positive FIS (0.258 ± 0.063). The overall polymorphic information content value is 0.494 ±0.052, which revealed its usefulness in determining the genetic diversity.
