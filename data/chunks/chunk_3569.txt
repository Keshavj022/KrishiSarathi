 This phenomenon is known as heat and mass transfer. Initially, moisture loss occurs from the outer surface of the food, leading to the formation of a dried, thick layer. This layer acts as an insulating barrier, slowing down the rate of heat transfer into the food. This, in turn, establishes a moisture gradient, further reducing the drying rate. As the dehydration process progresses, the food reaches its normal equilibrium relative humidity (ERH), where heat and mass transfer rates diminish significantly. At this point, no further weight or moisture loss occurs unless the atmospheric conditions surrounding the food are altered. Pusa Shobha Pusa Shobha, a variety developed at the Division of Vegetable Science, ICAR-IARI, New Delhi, stands out with its distinctive brown skin and white flesh. These onions feature a compact, flat globe shape and a brown colour, making them well-suited for storage, drying, processing, and export. The bulbs typically have a diameter ranging from 4.5 to 6.0 cm, with a polar diameter between 4.8 and 6.5 cm. The weight of a single bulb falls within the range of 70.0 to 100.0 grams. Pusa Shobha’s white flesh exhibits a high TSS content of approximately 16±2 degrees Brix, dry matter (16.18%) making it particularly suitable for processing purposes (Table 2). Table 2.

Differences between drying and dehydration Drying Dehydration Removal of water by the use of non-conventional energy sources like sun and wind Process of removal of water from the food by the application of artificial heat under controlled conditions of heat, RH, and airflow Sun drying is not possible in cloudy weather Dehydration is not weather dependent process The colour of the sun-dried product might not be uniform The colour of dehydrated products is uniform Food might be contaminated by dust and other contaminants Dehydration is done under hygienic conditions and products are safe Sun drying requires more space and time Dehydration requires less floor area and time Low and uneven moisture removal Higher and uniform moisture removal Pretreatment and drying condition The pre-treatment of onion slices with a 5% NaCl solution yielded the best results in terms of retaining antioxidant activity, total phenols, pungency, and achieving a better rehydration ratio. This treatment also resulted in lower levels of non-enzymatic browning and moisture content in the final product when compared to other treatments.
