 It is native to arid regions of India, particularly in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. The tree has a distinctive appearance with a gnarled and twisted trunk, small leaves, and thorny branches. It typically reaches 1-1.5 m high and thrives in hot and dry climates with well-drained soil. In C. wightii, leaf shedding typically occurs during the dry season, which is a natural response to conserve water and protect the plant from excessive water loss. This shedding of leaves allows the plant to enter a period of dormancy, conserving energy until favourable conditions return. It is worth noting that the exact timing and duration of leaf shedding can vary depending on factors such as climate, geographical location, and individual plant health. The resin is extracted from the bark of the tree and has a unique fragrance. Guggul has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for its therapeutic properties, particularly in treating various ailments such as arthritis, obesity, and cholesterol-related disorders. The resin contains bioactive compounds called guggulsterones, which have shown anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cholesterol-lowering properties, among others. C. wightii is known to exhibit slow growth rates. Several factors can contribute to the slow growth of Commiphora plants like natural slow growth habits, Manish Kumar Suthar*, Manish Kumar Mittal and Manish Das nutrient limitations, watering practices (Overwatering or inadequate watering), etc. C. wightii has most recently been assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2014. C. wightii is listed as ‘Critically Endangered’. Several factors contribute to the vulnerability of wightii like habitat loss, overharvesting, climate change, etc. Sustainable harvesting practices, proper management, and cultivation initiatives are implemented to ensure the long-term availability of these valuable plants. By promoting sustainable practices, economic benefits can be derived while also supporting the conservation of Commiphora populations and their natural habitats. It is important to Prospects Commiphora wightii: New growth, after leaf shed (dormant), flower, thorn and fruit Guggul plant and resin derived from its stem Guggul Gum resin antilipidemic (lipid lowering) antioxidant & anti-inflammatory Indian Horticulture 30 note that the collection of guggul resin should be done in a sustainable manner to avoid overharvesting and damaging trees. Local regulations and guidelines should be followed, and efforts should be made to promote responsible and eco-friendly practices in resin collection. Secondary metabolites in guggul C. wightii is known for its production of various secondary metabolites, including guggulsterones, which have been extensively studied for their pharmacological activities. The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in C. wightii involves several key enzymatic steps. Although the specific details of the biosynthetic pathways in C.
