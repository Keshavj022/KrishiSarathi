 By integrating IoT, farmers can optimize resource-use, increase productivity, and manage risk more effectively. Applications of IoT in rainfed agriculture are described below. Soil moisture and nutrient monitoring: IoT-based soil sensors can measure key properties such as moisture levels, temperature, pH, and nutrient content. These sensors provide continuous data that helps farmers understand when their soil has enough moisture to support crop growth or if it requires conservation measures like mulching. Nutrient sensors inform farmers about the nutrient status of the soil, allowing them to adjust fertilization plans accordingly and avoid nutrient deficiencies or overuse. Weather monitoring: IoT weather stations equipped with sensors for temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed help farmers access hyper-local weather information in real-time. Accurate weather data is crucial in rainfed agriculture for planning sowing, harvesting, and field operations. This allows farmers to align agricultural practices with current and forecasted weather conditions, reducing the risk of crop failure. Smart irrigation systems: Smart irrigation systems using IoT can provide supplementary irrigation during dry spells. These systems rely on soil moisture data and weather forecasts to determine when and how much water to apply, optimizing water-use and ensuring crops have enough moisture to thrive. Integrating IoT sensors with AI systems further enhances this capability by providing real-time feedback on soil and environmental conditions. Crop monitoring and health analysis: IoT devices, such as drones and remote sensors, can be deployed to monitor crop health through imaging and data collection. These devices can detect signs of disease, pest infestation, or water stress, which may not be visible from the ground. Coupled with machine learning algorithms, IoT devices can identify patterns and send alerts to farmers, enabling them to take timely action to protect their crops. Data-driven decision support: The data collected by IoT sensors is often fed into decision support systems (DSS), which provide farmers with actionable insights. For instance, these systems can recommend the best times for planting and harvesting based on current and predicted weather patterns, soil moisture, and crop growth stages. Farmers can access this information via mobile apps or web platforms, facilitating real-time decision-making. Technological components of IoT: IoT components are soil moisture, temperature, humidity sensors, nutrient and pest detection sensors; devices that measure rainfall, wind speed, temperature, and other climate parameters; Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN, cellular networks, and satellite communications that facilitate data transfer. Challenges and considerations Data accessibility is the major concern and obtaining reliable data on weather, soil, and crops may be difficult in remote areas.
