 KVK, Chittoor conducted demonstrations on yield improvement in groundnut by giving supplemental irrigation using sprinklers during kharif 2016 and 2017. During kharif 2016, the groundnut crop suffered due to two dry spells (1 to 29 August: 29 days and 30 August to 30 September: 32 days) during cropping season. During kharif 2017 also, the groundnut crop faced two dry spells (25 June to 10 July: 15 days and 17 July to 30 July: 15 days) at vegetative phase of the cropping period. KVK supplied sprinklers to farmers through Custom Hiring Center to provide supplemental irrigation to groundnut crop to overcome drought situation. About 38% increase in yield was observed in groundnut with supplementary irrigation using sprinklers (2,140 kg/ha). Drought tolerant ‘Dharani’ groundnut variety RASS KVK conducted 40 demonstrations on improved, drought and bud necrosis tolerant Dharani groundnut variety from kharif 2015 to 2018. Yield potential of Dharani variety is 16-26 q/ha (Kharif- rainfed), with 75-77% shelling outturn and 50% oil content. Hundred seed weight is 40-43 g and it is of 100-105 days duration. The variety is drought tolerant (withstands up to 35 days dry spell), uniform in maturity, high SMK (Sound Mature Kernel-90%) and has attractive pods. Dharani groundnut variety performed better and about 15.8% increase in yield (1,796 kg/ha) was recorded over Kadiri-6 (1,551 kg/ha). It was due to more number of pods, uniform pod maturity and high shelling percentage and drought resistance during dry spells, tolerance to bud necrosis . The technology disseminated to an area of around 1,000 ha in the mandal and nearby mandals. Triple disease resistant tomato hybrid, Arka Samrat Traditionally farmers in NICRA cluster villages cultivate private hybrids in tomato crop which are susceptible to diseases like tomato leaf curl virus, bacterial wilt and early blight causing considerable yield loss. Farmers are used to managing diseases by spraying combination of fungicides 8-10 times during cropping period by spending huge amount. Hence RASS KVK demonstrated triple disease resistant tomato hybrid, Arka Smarat during the years 2017-18 and 2018-19. It is resistant to tomato leaf curl, bacterial wilt and early blight with a yield potential of 80-85 t/ha in 140 days. Arka Samrat recorded about 11.6% increase in yield (58,520 kg/ha) when compared to Sweekar 448 (52,200 kg/ha). Cost of tomato production was more in Sweekar 448 due to more amount (`6,000 per ha) incurred by the farmers for disease control. Disease incidence was not observed in Arka Samrat, whereas about 1-25% incidence was observed in Sweekar 448. Resource conservation technology in paddy – Direct seeding using drum seeder Manual transplanting is the most common method of crop establishment in paddy in the cluster villages. It involves nursery bed preparation, nursery growing, care of seedlings, uprooting of seedlings and transport to main field.
