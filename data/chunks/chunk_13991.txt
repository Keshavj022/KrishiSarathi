 Automation: Farm automation and smart farming are acknowledged by machines that do agricultural tasks, which also reduces the strain on human resources. Among the contemporary technologies utilized for agricultural automation are harvesters, drones, customized tractors, and watering motors. Application of Technologies in Agriculture (ICAR, 2024) 1. Wireless Sensor Networks: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are extensively employed in agricultural monitoring to enhance farming's quality and output. Various kinds of data, such as temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide level, are collected in real-time scenarios using sensors. The wireless sensors Application of AI in Agriculture Sector in India. https://iaeme.com/Home/journal/IJAIRD 161 editor@iaeme.com that make up the Sensor Network are tiny and usually run on batteries. The sensor gathers the data, which is subsequently transmitted from the sensor to the network. Additionally, farmers and other agricultural stakeholders can use data analytics to generate intelligence that helps them make wise decisions, enhance farming techniques, and obtain insightful knowledge. Following are the various sensors used in agriculture: Sensor Purpose Common Agriculture Usage Soil Moisture Sensor Determine the soil's moisture content. These sensors, which are installed in the ground at different depths, give armers access to real-time data that helps them manage water use and protect crops from waterlogging and drought stress. Soil Temperature Sensor Track the soil's temperature to find the best times to plant, the ideal circumstances for seed germination, and the level of microbial activity. These sensors, which are positioned at various depths in the soil profile, send out temperature data, enabling farmers to make well-informed choices about crop selection, planting dates, and temperature-sensitive pest management techniques. Soil Nitrate Sensor Measure the amount of nitrate ions in the soil to determine how much fertilizer is needed. By providing farmers with real-time readings of the nitrate level, these sensors help them prevent nitrogen leaching, maximize crop output, and precisely regulate fertilizer applications. Humidity Sensor In order to maximize photosynthesis, avoid fungal illnesses, and preserve healthy microclimates, it monitors the humidity levels in the air. Through the transmission of humidity data, these sensors allow farmers to optimize crop health and productivity by controlling irrigation, ventilation, and heating systems. Dissolved Oxygen Sensor Measure the concentration of oxygen dissolved in water to maintain suitable conditions. By using these sensors, aquafarmers can modify stocking densities, feeding rates, and aeration by receiving real time information on the amount of dissolved oxygen present in ponds or tanks. pH Sensor Monitor the acidity or alkalinity of soil or water to regulate nutrient availability, microbial activity, and overall crop health.
