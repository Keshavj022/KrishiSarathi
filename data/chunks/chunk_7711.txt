 The use of nylon netting could thus become an important component of integrated management of rhinoceros beetle in plantation crops. Oil palm: Application of Isaria fumosorosea fungus strain was effective in managing rugose spiralling whitefly (RSW) Aleurodicus rugioperculatus when applied at a spore concentration of 130 × 104. Liquid culture preparation of Isaria fungus was standardized using PDB and starch. The protocols for mass multiplication and mother culture multiplication were standardized using starch and jaggery. Vegetables Pumpkin: An integrated pest management module for pumpkin (cv. Kashi Harit) comprising spraying of DDVP 76% EC @ 0.75 ml/litre at 20 and 30 days after sowing (DAS), Bacillus thuringiensis var. Kurstaki @ 2 g/litre at 40 DAS, imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 1 ml/3 litre at 50 DAS, Lecanicillium lecanii @ 5 g/litre at 60 DAS and Azadirachtin 300 ppm @ 5 ml/litre at 70 DAS was standardized. It was most effective in reducing the red pumpkin beetle, white fly; and mirid bug population on leaves with significant increase in the yield (320 q/ha) over chemical (307 q/ha) or untreated control (195 q/ha). Bio-pesticides: Thar Jaivik 41 EC is an organic bio- pesticide developed from local wild plants and cow product. It is effective against Helicoverpa armigera, Spodoptera litura, white fly and aphid with safe to natural enemies. Bio-management of nematode induced disease complex: In chillies cv. Arka Meghana, seed treatment with talc formulations of bacterial bio-agent, Bacillus pumilus 1% WP at 20 g/kg seed, substrate treatment at 10 g/kg coco-peat and soil application of 5 t/ha FYM enriched with bio-agents recorded significantly 27.3% higher yield and 72.2 to 74.1% lower nematode population in soil and roots with low gall index (1.8). Spices Cumin: An eco-friendly, integrated nematode (root- lesion nematode; Pratylenchus thornei) management technology in cumin comprising soil application (5 kg/ ha) of bio agents was standardized. It resulted in 81.5% reduced plant mortality of cumin. The chemical management technique comprising soil sterilization by application of dazomet (@ 30 g/m2) and metham sodium (60 ml/m2) resulted in 98% reduction of plant mortality in cumin. Transcriptomics of Radopholus similis: The transcriptome of burrowing nematode (Radopholus similis), a serious pest of tropical plants, was sequenced. A total of 62,312 unigenes (73.09%), ranging from 201– 10,747 bp with a mean contig size of 1046 bp were obtained. The assembled contigs were functionally annotated and protein domains were predicted. Out of these, 1116 Excretory/Secretory (ES) proteins were predicted and functionally annotated. Potential targets for gene silencing were identified, cloned and sequenced. Diseases and their management Fusarium wilt (Panama disease) disease: In June 2017, there was a severe loss to banana due to Fusarium wilt at Sohawal block of Ayodhya, Eastern Uttar Pradesh.
