 At the UAS, Bangalore, evaluation and regeneration of the synthetic Pb-2 line originally received from PAU, Ludhiana, continued and the average body weight Breeding stock of Black Brown rabbit was selected with high selection differential A pair of layer cross LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 99 of female pureline was 1,200 g at 6 weeks of age. At the JNKVV, Jabalpur, evaluation of purebred dwarf dam continued. In the 37 random sample broiler test at Hessarghata, the commercials from the CARI attained 1,195 and 1,486 g body weight with feed efficiency of 1.45 and 1.82 at 6 and 7 weeks of age, respectively, while the first and second entry from the UAS, Bangalore, attained 950 and 1,198 g at 6 weeks of age, with feed conversion ratio of 1.80 and 1.44, respectively, and the same attained 1,244 and 1,437 g body weight at 7 weeks of age with respective feed conversion ratio of 2.09 and 1.88. At another testing centre in Gurgaon, the entries from the PAU, Ludhiana, secured second position in the 17 RSBT by attaining 1,480 and 1,958 g body weight at 6 and 7 weeks of age, respectively. The entries from the CARI closely followed those of the PAU, Ludhiana, in the same test. In yet another random sample test conducted at Bhubaneshwar, the lone entry sent by the CARI centre secured second position with a recorded body weight of 1,495 and 1,713 g at 6 and 7 weeks of age with corresponding feed efficiency of 2.2 and 2.4. The per cent livability of broilers sent from different AICRP centres was more than 97.5%. The heat tolerant major gene i.e. Naked Neck (Na) was introgressed in broiler stock and populations having colour (NNCP) and white plumage (NNWP) were developed. Both the populations completed 5 generations of selection. The body weight of NNCP at 4, 6 and 7 week were 774, 1,408 and 1,573g, respectively. Corresponding weights in NNWP were 786, 1,426 and 1,732g. Poultry for Egg Under the AICRP Network programme, intra population selection for egg production up to 64 weeks of age superimposed with independent culling level selection for egg weight at 28 weeks and layer house mortality, was continued. The phenotypic response as a consequence of intrapopulation selection followed a desirable direction for principal traits of selection. The response to selection for enhanced period of 64 week egg production in IWD and IWF lines at the ANGRAU was positive by producing 9 to 20 eggs more than the controls, and by 72 weeks of age this advantage marginally declined to a range of 5-15 eggs. The hen housed egg production at 72 weeks was 268 and 282 eggs for IWD and IWF lines, respectively. Four generations of selection for egg number up to 64 weeks of age did not favour early sexual maturity in the population. At the KAU, Mannuthy, the S-19 generation of IWN and IWP showed an increase of 13 and 17 eggs, respectively, compared to the control by 40 weeks of age. The culling level of selection for egg weight resulted in achieving 50.
