 Emergence of exotic and emerging animal diseases First whole genome analysis of Indian African swine fever viruses reveals potential genetic determinants to differentiate closely related ASFV circulating in Asia: After emergence, ASF has been confirmed in 19 states across the country and has caused heavy mortality and economic losses. Whole genome of two ASF viruses isolated from domestic pigs during first outbreaks in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh were sequenced and analysed. The sizes of assembled complete genome of ASFV from Assam (IND/AS/SD-02/2020) and Arunachal Pradesh (IND/AR/SD-61/2020) isolates were 190,517 bp and 190,572 bp, respectively. The complete genome sequences were annotated to 219 putative genes as compared to 194 genes in ASFV Georgia/2007. Both sequences of Indian ASFVs had insertion of one extra TRS (TATATAGGAA) in the intergenic region between I73R and I329L and a few unique mutations were observed in MGF 369-11L, MGF 505-4R, K205R and B263R genes. Global alignment of the complete genome sequences showed nucleotide identity of 99.96% amongst the two Indian isolates (IND/AS/SD-02/2020 and IND/ AR/SD-61/2020). With other genotype-2 ASFV such as Georgia/2007 and Wuhan 2019-1, the nucleotide identity was 99.73% to 99.75% and 99.95% to 99.98%, respectively. The Indian isolates had unique SNP with predicted amino acid transitions viz. E294G in MGF 369-11L, K225E in MGF 505-4R, R188K in K205R and V168A in B263R genes. Complete genome based phylodendrogram of Indian ASFV isolates with 33 additional ASFV sequences showed their clustering under clade 2.2.2 with other p72-genotype-II ASFV reported from Tanzania, Georgia, China, Vietnam, Poland, Ukraine, East Timor leste, etc. Phylogenetically, concatenated nucleotide sequence of 14 open reading frames (ORF) with single nucleotide polymorphism of Indian isolates grouped separately with other ASFVs from Asia. Our results showed the importance of the 14 ORFs in understanding the evolution of ASFV in Asian countries and their divergence from prototype Livestock Management icar annual report 2022-23 116 IVRI-Online Veterinary Clinic Portal The IVRI-Online Veterinary Clinic portal was released during the X Convocation of IVRI. Plastic Based Two-tier Housing System Climate friendly shelter is imperative for optimal productivity of the animals. Animals housed in twotier housing system had significantly higher average daily weight gain; owing to more hygienic environment contributing to fewer incidences of diarrhoea and respiratory problems as kids had less contact with faecal materials and chance of infection was lower. Bakri Garbhadhan Setu A mobile App on ‘Artificial insemination in goats’ was developed. This App provides the videos related to various aspects of AI in goats through which a simple or less educated stakeholder can easily understand the different aspects of AI.
