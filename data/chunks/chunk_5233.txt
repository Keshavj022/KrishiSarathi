RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results of PRA field survey are presented in Tables 1–10. The experimental results related to cultural studies and nutritive analyses are summarized in Tables 11–13. The photographs of different species of Morchella, their ecological habitats and tribal communities marketing their valuable products are given in Figs 1 to 5. PRA and field study Table 1 lists the twelve different localities that were visited during the spring season in Kinnaur district. These localities were situated at different altitudes ranging from 22,00 to 35,00 m above msl. The most predominant vegetation was of mixed conifers e.g. Pinus gerardiana, Quercus dilatata, Picea smithiana, Cedrus deodara etc. The morels were collected from all the localities visited and situated in these high-altitude areas. The nomenclature of different species of Table 2.

Hence Morchella is known by different names in Kinnaur. The name changes with the change in valley. This is perhaps because the means of communication were very poor in this area previously. The colour of fruiting bodies also shows variation at different altitudes. The season of collection varies from spring to monsoon.All the villagers, especially women and shepherds collect them as a source of income. The solitary and gregarious habit also showed variations with the change in colour. Black morels were always seen to occur solitary, whereas light- coloured morels were always seen to occur gregariously (Table 2).
