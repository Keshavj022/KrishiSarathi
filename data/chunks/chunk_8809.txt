 Rabi sorghum: In rabi, the earlier released bold grain and shootfly-resistant hybrid CSH 15R is gaining popularity among the farmers. During the year, hybrid SPH 1010 has been released as CSH19R. This yielded highest (3,066 kg/ha) under multilocation trials and was 32.1% superior to M 35-1 (2,321 kg/ha) and 23.8% to CSH 15R (2,475 kg/ha). DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 22 Diversification of CMS Lines Two new male sterile lines on A2 cytoplasm and 2 new male sterile lines on Maldandi cytoplasm have been developed and evaluated. Crop Production Intercropping of Sorghum Among the intercrops, pigeonpea with sorghum was found superior to soybean and groundnut in terms of the monetary returns, besides the pure crop. Crop Protection Entries with multiple disease resistance are SPV 1531, 1533, SPH 1148, 1250, 1251 and 1268. Parental lines C43 RS 673 and RS 29 are found resistant to grain mold and RS 29 and AKMS 14B to downy mildew. Some lines resistant to shootfly and also showing resistance to grain mold are GMRP 13, SRF 142, SR 770-7 and SRF 133-8. Entries which showed resistant to charcoal rot are SPV Nos. 1380, 15- 4, 1457, 1491, 1411 and 1538 and hybrids are SPH 1303, 1302, SPH 1305 and SPH 1314. Parental lines as resistant to charcoal rot are 27A, CS 3541, 27B and 296 B. JAGGERY FROM SWEET SORGHUM Jaggery prepared from NSS 104 and SSV 84 has confectionery taste. Maximum jaggery production was with SSV 84, yielding 7.67%. INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT FOR SORGHUM SHOOTFLY Field experiments were conducted to determine the effect of integrated pest management modules on the incidence of shootfly Atherigona soccata Rondani. In all modules, neem spray at 3.0-5.0% effectively repelled egg-laying of shootfly, Atherigona soccata, reflecting as low dead hearts’ formation. Intercropping of sorghum and pigeonpea in 2:1 row ratio was also useful. A combination of soil application of muriate of potash (30kg/ha) and seed treatment with Imidacloprid at 10-14 ml/kg minimized losses effectively.
