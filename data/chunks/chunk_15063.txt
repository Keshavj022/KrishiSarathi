 Environmental and Sustainability Indicators 25 (2025) 100544 6 4.7. Project on CRA- Maharashtra (POCRA) (2018–2024) The POCRA is a collaborative initiative between the Maharashtra government and the World Bank. It focuses on developing a climate- resilient strategy for the state’s agricultural sector (URL: https://proj ects.worldbank.org/). The project has aimed to improve the climate resilience and profitability of smallholder farming systems in various districts of Maharashtra while addressing the potential effects of climate change and its unpredictability. The government has approved the project’s second phase, which is set to begin in June 2024 and extend to five more districts: Nagpur, Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur, and Gad- chiroli. For more information on available CRA projects in India, see ST.1. 5. Sustainability indicators for CRA According to multiple sources (Rao et al., 2019b ; Singh et al., 2021; Zong et al., 2022; García and Rubio, 2022; Satapathy et al., 2011), comprehensive indicators for CRA are categorized into six primary groups: ecological and environmental, social, economic, institutional, infrastructural, and technological (see Fig. 3). In India, ecological and economic impacts within CRA are mainly influenced by factors such as rainfall deviation, greenhouse gas emissions, and farm market dynamics (Rao et al., 2019a). Regions like the Indo-Gangetic Plains exhibit high adoption rates of farm mechanization, highlighted by socioeconomic resilience indicators in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Goa, and Kerala (Aryal et al., 2020). In terms of infrastructural and institutional resilience, Andhra Pradesh, Chandi- garh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala, and Puducherry demonstrate sig- nificant adaptability. Over peninsular India’s agroecological zones, institutional efforts have led to the adoption of low-carbon strategies, including biofuels, solar energy, and optimized water management (Kritee et al., 2019). In Rajasthan, NGOs enhance soil health with water-conserving plants and assist farmers in transitioning from irrigated to rain-fed agriculture as streamflow diminishes (Ludwig et al., 2018; Chatterjee et al., 2005). In eastern India, integrating wheat and rice crops into unified sys- tems has proven essential for maximizing productivity, supporting food security, and bolstering climate resilience (Acevedo et al., 2020). In the northeastern region, particularly in Sikkim and Nagaland, key CRA Fig. 3.

Environmental and Sustainability Indicators 25 (2025) 100544 7 evaluation indicators include vulnerability, adaptation, and resilience. Initiatives like the “Organic Sikkim” mission enhance climate resilience through biodiversity management, traditional medicinal plant promo- tion, and infrastructure development (Bhatnagar, 2021). 6.
