 To address research questions RQ2 and RQ3, a co-word analysis utilizing author keywords was implemented to elucidate the knowledge structure within the CCRASAI field. This method provided insights into the predominant themes and subjects foundational to research in this domain. Following this, a network analysis of keyword co-occurrences, executed with VOSViewer software, facilitated the identification of prevalent themes (clusters) and subjects within the CCRASAI literature. Such an analytical technique is widely recognized in bibliometric studies for pinpointing the core elements that constitute the basis of research fields [28]. For the construction of the keyword network, only author keywords that appeared a minimum of five times within the dataset were considered, yielding a selection of 54 keywords. This studyâ€™s analysis delineated seven distinct clusters from these keywords, with each cluster symbolizing a recurrent subject across the CCRASAI literature. In this research, the authors also focused on studying CCRASAI at the national level, covering globally and encompassing nearly fifteen broad agro-climatic regions of India. These regions include the Western Himalayas, Eastern Himalayas, Lower Gangetic plains, Middle Gangetic plains, Upper Gangetic plains, Trans-Gangetic plains, Eastern Plateau and hills, Central Plateau and hills, Western Plateau and hills, Southern Plateau and hills, East coast, West coast, Gujarat plains and hills, and Island regions. Additionally, various bibliometric indicators, including the Hirsch index (h-index), total citations, impact factor, and the number of articles, have been utilized for ranking purposes. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Trend in publication outputs and citations in India A total of 572 articles pertaining to CCRASAI, published between 1994 and 2022, were retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Table 1 presents their bibliometric characteristics. These articles, contributed by 1644 authors and encompassing 1544 keywords, predominantly originated from India. The average citation per CCRASAI article stood at 17.1. Metrics such as the number of authors per article, co-authors per article, and the collaboration index were 2.87, 4.43, and 3.11, respectively. Fig. 3 depicts a year-by-year distribution of CCRASAI research articles. Overall, the number of publications in CCRASAI research exhibits an upward trend from 1994 (1) to 2022 (572), with a peak in 2021 & 2022. However, certain years showed fewer publications than in previous years. In 1994, there was only a single publication related to the problems and prospects of development in the Indian arid zone, and until 2007, there were only a few publications on this topic. Moreover, the growth pattern of CCRASAI research grew steadily after 2007, which was accelerated in the past decade.
