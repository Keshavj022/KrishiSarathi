The heritability estimates for birth weight, 3, 6, 9 and 12 month body weight, first 6 monthly and second 6 monthly greasy fleece weight were 0.307±0.054, 0.436±0.061, 0.346±0.056, 0.399±0.060, 0.309±0.054, 0.392± 0.059 and 0.307±0.054, respectively. Muzaffarnagri: At the CIRG, Makhdoom, Muzaffarnagri sheep is being improved for mutton production through selection. The average birth, 3, 6 and 9 month weights were 3.16, 13.11, 20.79 and 22.25 kg, respectively. The adult annual greasy fleece yield was 1.25 kg. Feed conversion efficiency was 19.55% in males and 16.59% in females. Selection differential for 6-month body weight and wool yield was 5.45 kg and 96 g respectively. Overall mortality was 4.84%. Deccani: At the MPKV, Rahuri, development of elite flock of Deccani sheep is under progress. Average body weights at birth, weaning, 6, 9 and 12 months of age were 3.06, 14.66, 19.92, 21.62 and 23.64 kg, respectively. Nellore: At the ANGRU, Palamner, sheep is being improved through selection for mutton production using selection index incorporating body weight at 6 and 9 months of age. The overall means for body weights at birth, 6, 9 and 12 months of age were 2.95, 13.92, 22.39, and 26.61 kg respectively. The overall means for pre- weaning and post-weaning daily were 144 and 34 g, respectively. Magra: At the RAU, Bikaner, Magra sheep is being improved through selection. This is field based unit. There were 3,454 lambing (74.3%). The average body weights at birth, 6, 12 months and adult stage were 2.79, 21.08, 29.09 and 35.82 kg, respectively. Average greasy fleece weight was higher (940 g) at first 6 months age and lowest (659 g) in adult group. The selection differential for 12 month body weight and greasy fleece weight at this age was 7.1 kg and 102 g, respectively. Madras Red : At the TANUVAS, Kattupakkam, the Madras Red sheep is being improved through selection for mutton production. Average body weight at birth, 6, 9 and 12 months was 2.86, 14.64, 18.48 and 20.6 kg, respectively. GOAT Genetic Improvement and Sire Evaluation of Jamunapari Goats for Milk Production Aim of the project is to improve production performance of Jamunapari goats through selective breeding. Index for selection of breeding bucks was developed including 9 months body weight of the individual and 90 days milk yield of their dam. Selected bucks were used to generate progenies. The mean body weight at birth, 3,6,9 and 12 months of age were 2.89±0.03, 9.42±0.16, 14.38±0.25, 18.98±0.55 and 24.57±0.67 kg, respectively. The genetic potential of the breed in intensive system of management revealed the body weight of about 13.
