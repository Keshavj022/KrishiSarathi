Owing to composition involving complex carbohydrates, low-glycemic index, high-dietary fibre and adequacy in micronutrients, pulses prevent many chronic degenerative diseases. Beyond their nutritional profile, integrating pulses into cropping systems enhances soil quality, as they fulfill their own nitrogen requirements and confer benefits to subsequent crops, thus reducing the need for industrial nitrogen inputs. Moreover, pulses serve as an ideal option for crop diversification and intensification, offering a sustainable approach to agricultural practices. With their low water footprint, negative carbon footprint, and soil-conserving properties, pulses deliver crucial environmental benefits that contribute to sustainable agriculture and climate change mitigation, particularly within rainfed ecosystems.
