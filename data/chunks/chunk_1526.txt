High yielding varieties of garden pea (Kashi Nandani, Kashi Uday, Kashi Mukti), pumpkin (Kashi Harit and Kashi Basant), brinjal (Kashi Sandesh) and sponge gourd (Kashi Divya) show an average increase of more than 10% yield at farmers’ fields. Use of quality planting materials Quality seeds/nursery plants are an essential entry point for sustainability and an approach to increase productivity. For development of seed sector, ICAR institutes, CAUs, SAUs an other government organizations directly joined the hands with the private seed sector, as WorldVeg Breeding Programme is being run with the Asia-Pacific Seed Association and the Africa Seed Trade Association in Asia and Africa, which is noteworthy. Use of grafting technologies Use of grafting technologies (elite scion cultivars onto vigorous rootstock cultivars) in climate-resilient vegetable cultivation is rewarding with respect to increase in yield as well as quality, long duration fruiting etc. and addressing 30-40% biotic (resistance to nematode, Fusarium and bacterial wilt, etc.) and nearly 60-70% abiotic (salinity, drought, suboptimal temperatures, water availability etc.) problems. For Indian Farming 50 January 2025 example, grafted brinjal is covering large areas in our country. Protected cultivation The demand in world markets has led to more vegetable production under protected structures (shade net house, modified insect-proof net house, naturally ventilated greenhouses, plastic low tunnels, temporary plastic walls and plastic mulches). In India, ~ 150,000 ha is under protected cultivation. The yield increased up to 4-5 times in capsicum, cucumber, cherry and tomato. The strong wind velocity with sand- storms and continuous high temperature range for the prolonged period (March October) are two prime limiting factors in arid climate. Movable and folding type structure (modifications in low-tunnel to tent type) with polythene as covering material is suitable for early cucurbits sowing under protection and to save the crop from low temperature/frost conditions during the peak winters followed by polythene removal in last week of January. Under extreme cold region, specific polyethylene cladding material in polyhouses and tranches has increased yield and quality of vegetables.
