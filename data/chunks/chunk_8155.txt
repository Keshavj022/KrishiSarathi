 These methods are rapid; require relatively small amounts of grain, wheat meal, or flour; and provide information that can be used to improve the end use quality potential of breeding material. Processing quality of nutrient rich pearl millet: To simulate model for optimizing the biochemical conditions associated with low rancidity. To identify superior varieties/hybrids with better processing quality based on the simulated model. Mapping the micronutrient concentration in diverse population of pearl millet grains.

Whole transcriptome sequencing of pearl millet hybrid Pusa 1201 for the identification of genes associated with rancidity. Characterizing the genes associated with Fe/Zn transporter in pearl millet for enhancing the micronutrient density in pearl millet flour. Association mapping for favorable alleles for grain Fe and Zn: A set of 96 diverse germplasm lines of lentil (Lens culinaris subsp culinaris) were evaluated at three different locations in India to examine the variation in iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentrations and identify simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers that associate with the genetic variation. The genetic variation among genotypes of the association mapping (AM) panel was characterized using a genetic distance- based and a general model-based clustering method. The model-based analysis identified six subpopulations, which satisfactorily explained the genetic structure of the AM panel. AM analysis identified three SSRs (PBALC 13, PBALC 206 and GLLC 563) associated with grain Fe concentration explaining 9% to 11% of phenotypic variation and four SSRs (PBALC 353, SSR 317Â±1, PLC 62, and PBALC 217) were associated with grain Zn concentration explaining 14% to 21% of phenotypic variation. These identified SSRs exhibited consistent performance across locations. These candidate SSRs can be used in marker-assisted genetic improvement for developing Fe and Zn fortified lentil varieties. Favourable alleles and promising genotypes can be utilized for lentil biofortification. Genome/gene editing for multiple stress tolerance and yield enhancement in crop Molecular mapping of QTLs for aluminium tolerance: Major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) identified for Al resistance using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in F2 and F3 mapping populations derived from contrasting parents.
