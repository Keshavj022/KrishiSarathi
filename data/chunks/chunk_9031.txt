 In addition, six promising lines identified for release are VL Madira 181 barnyard millet for Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu; VLG 7 garlic for Uttaranchal, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Bihar; VL Matar 40 field pea; VR 431 spring rice; VL 798 wheat; and VLB 56 barley for Uttaranchal. Seed Production During the year 12.81 tonnes of breeder seed (wheat and barley 7.2 tonnes, rice 0.5 tonne, maize 0.22 tonne, small millets 0.3 tonne, pulses 0.44 tonne, oilseeds 3.0 tonnes and vegetables 0.29 tonne) of improved crop varieties for hills was produced. Besides, 9.68 tonnes of truthfully lebelled seeds of improved varieties were also multiplied and distributed among the hill farmers. Vivek Dhan 82, an early-duration (120-125 days), blast-tolerant, long, bold-grained rice gives 47.3 and 45.5% more yield than national check K 39 and zonal check K 448-1-2 Identification of Resistant Sources Several lines of field crops were found resistant against major diseases in different crops. These include VL 93-3613 and VL 95-3623 for blast; VL 97-3861 and VL 97-3678 for brown spot, sheath rot and tungro diseases in rice; VL 818 for leaf blight and VL 616 and VL 804 for foot rot in wheat; V 217, V 324, V 336, V 338 and V 339 for turcicum and maydis blights in maize; and VP 9211 for powdery mildew in gardenpea. Besides, FC 1, DPP 9411, and JP 585 garden pea also showed consistency in resistance to powdery mildew disease. Similarly, three rice lines (VL 97-3652, VL 97-3653 and VL 97-3656) have shown resistance against major insect-pests (stem-borer, leaf folder, planthopper and gall midge). Breeder seed production plots in wheat ● Vivek Dhan 82 rice variety released and 6 promising lines identified for release (1 each in barnyard millet, garlic, field pea, spring rice, wheat and barley) ● 9.68 tonnes truthfully labelled seeds of improved crop varieties for hills multiplied and distributed among hill farmers ● Uttaranchal hill has congenial environment for growing broccoli, knol- khol, lettuce and parsley ● Resistance sources identified against major diseases in rice, wheat, maize and garden pea ● Rockphsophate proved better source of P for cauliflower ● Improved grasses performed better than local ones for fodder production in hills RESEARCH FOR TRIBAL AND HILL REGIONS 189 European Vegetables KTS 2, a variety of broccoli was found promising for curd size ranging from 150 to 300 g (average 250 g/plant). It can be harvested in 60-65 days after transplanting, yielding 10-15 tonnes/ha. White Vienna, a short-duration knol-khol, can be harvested in 40-50 days after transplanting. Its average knob size is 200-300 g/plant and can produce 20-25 tonnes/ha. Rockphosphate, a Better Source of Phosphorus for Cauliflower The yield of cauliflower was 15.96 tonnes/ha when rockphosphate (RP) was used as source of P and it was on a par with that obtained with single superphosphate- treated plots.
