 Before sowing treat seed with Mancozeb + Carbendozim @ 3 g/kg seed by dissolving in 10-12 ml water/kg seed ; make paste of fungicide solution and rub on the seed.   For weed management in Direct Sown Rice, apply Pretilachlor 750 g a.i. per ha during 3-5 days after sowing for grasses and other weeds. Spray Pyrezosulfuron 10% W.P. @ 8 g /ha in 500 lr. of water in moist soil within 10-12 days of transplanting. It should be followed by 250 ml/ha Bispyribac Sodium 10 SC if the crop is infested with Sawan and motha or 40 g/ha Azimsulfuron 50DF or 20g/ha metsulfuron methyl+ chlorimuronethyle 20WP if the crop is infested with broadleaf weeds at 20-25 days of sowing in 350-400 litres of water.   Apply 130 kg urea/acre in three equal splits at 4,6 and 9 weeks after sowing.
