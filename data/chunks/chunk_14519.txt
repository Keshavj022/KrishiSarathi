 Upgrading irrigation infrastructure, for example, into increasingly promoted solar powered irrigation systems with significant upfront investment costs may not provide sufficient returns for most farms (Shah et al., 2018). Low capital investment op­ tions such as accessing the expanding and subsidized rural power grid may be more feasible for most farmers. Irrigation systems with high capital investments best target horticulturally oriented farms and farms Fig. 4. Graphical representation of differences in distribution of combined rice and wheat FDPIs for farmers with low and high irrigation frequencies for different irrigation costs. The violin plots show the distribution of personal daily incomes from full net value of rice-wheat production. Colored, vertical shapes show the density function of each group, the colored and horizontal dashed lines show the 25th and 75th percentile and the solid ones the median. The dotted black horizontal line is the poverty line of 1.90 PPP$ day−1. Table 2 Comparing the difference between FDPIs from systems with high and low irrigation frequencies for each irrigation cost group through two-sided paired t-test of. All tests are statistically significant (p < 0.01). These results indicate the average FDPI difference between farmers with low irrigation frequencies and those with high irrigation frequencies assuming different irrigation costs. This comparison aims to understand the order of magnitude in which irrigation cost, on average, affects FDPIs. price group Estimate ($PPP) statistic conf. Low ($PPP) conf.

Remote and resource-constrained cereal farmers are likely to rely on relatively low-cost, portable, easy to use and repair, diesel pumps until reliable access to electricity has reached these plots. Similarly, finding the right tariff policy for electrified farms – a heavily discussed policy lever – is unlikely to contribute to substantial trans­ formations of rural incomes by raising incomes from crop production (Sidhu et al., 2020). Even with nominal flat tariffs – a pro-poor tariff structure (Sidhu et al., 2020) – our results suggest that farmers in the EGP are not likely to see meaningful changes to their daily incomes from crop production vis a vis the international poverty line.
