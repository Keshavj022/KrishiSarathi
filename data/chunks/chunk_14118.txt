 Introduction Organophosphate pesticides (OPs) are among the most widely commercialised pesticides and are commonly used in agriculture. Due to their high water solubility, OPs pose significant health risks and induce toxicity in non-target organisms including humans [1]. The persistence of OPs in agricultural soils, along with their transport to surface and groundwater, mainly depends on volatilisation and degradation pro­ cesses [2]. OPs degrade rapidly upon exposure to sunlight and atmo­ spheric conditions, as well as through microbial activity, depending on their bioavailability in soil [3]. Currently, assessing the occurrence, extent and pathways of OPs degradation in agricultural soils presents a major challenge [2,4], although it is essential to predict their persistence and the formation of transformation products (TPs). Conventional monitoring methods, which rely on concentration measurements, often fail to differentiate between true degradation and non-degradative processes such as volatilisation and sorption, which can significantly contribute to pesticide dissipation in soil [5]. Compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of synthetic pesticides relies on the intrinsic isotopic composition at natural abundance of pesticide molecules and changes in the isotopic ratios of a given element (e.g., 13C/12C) within the molecule [6,7]. CSIA enables tracking reaction-specific isotopic ratio changes within the persistent, non-degraded fraction of a pesticide in agricultural soil [5]. This approach may help assessing pesticide degradation processes involving molecular cleavage, especially in cases where mass balance reconcilia­ tion is difficult and where TPs undergoing further reactions are not detected [6]. Carbon CSIA has been applied to agricultural soil to investigate the transformation of pesticides such as chloroacetanilide [8-10] and triazine herbicides [11], pyrethroid and OP insecticides [12, 13], dimethomorph and procymidone fungicides [13,14]. Laboratory experiments on various OPs have demonstrated the potential of 2D CSIA [5], combining δ13C and δ2H measurements, to elucidate hydrolysis mechanisms [15,16]. While these studies established the proof-of-concept for soil CSIA of pesticides, they were often confined to artificially contaminated laboratory settings, such as soil microcosms or lysimeters, using pesticide concentrations far exceeding those typically found in the environment. In contrast, field studies remain scarce [8,14]. Notably, there is a lack of reference studies that investigate the contri­ bution of degradative and non-degradative dissipation processes of widely used OPs in agricultural fields using CSIA. Profenofos, O-(4-Bromo-2-chlorophenyl) O-ethyl S-propyl (S)-phos­ phorothioate, is a widely used OP insecticide that inhibits acetylcho­ linesterase activity, providing effective control of agricultural pests such as rice stem borer, leafroller, spider mite, and cotton bollworm [17,18].
