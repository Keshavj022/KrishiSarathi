The bleached samples were washed with cold water and then neutral wash was carried out with 2 g/litre acetic acid. It was again washed and dried. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field survey Field study conducted at Thal village in Pithoragarh of district Uttaranchal revealed that all the farmers in the village use sisal rope for various purposes. Various types of ropes are prepared from the fibre for the following different purposes: (i) Mwal rope is used for covering the mouth of animal at the time of ploughing; (ii) Mathani rope is used for churning for the extraction of butter; (iii) Glaun rope is used in tying the neck of the animals; (iv) Jature rope is used for tying the neck of the animals with agricultural implements; (v) Dawanlrope is used for tying the bell with the neck of animal; and (vi) Jyaur rope is used for tying grass and wood bundles. Rope of sisal was perceived by the users to be superior with respect to appearance, durability and strength as compared to rope made from bhimal and jute. Experiment Physical properties The average length of sisal fibre was recorded to be 52.65 cm, which was much greater than that of bhimal (7.4 cm) and cotton (2.0 cm). This is an indication of good quality of the fibre. The fibre diameter of sisal was found to be 0.14 mm, which was greater than both bhimal (0.07 mm) and cotton (0.03 mm). The strength of sisal fibre was found to be 52.24 g/tex which was much higher than that of bhimal (47.5 g/tax) and cotton (45.0 g/tax) (Table 1, Fig. 1). Chemical properties Moisture content of sisal and bhimal fibre was found to be almost equal (9.8% and 9.62% respectively) but higher than of cotton (7.69%). The moisture values serve as an indication of the susceptibility to rotting (Table 2). Ash content of sisal fibre (1.60%) was higher as compared to that of bhimal fibre (0.70%) and fibre of cotton (0.77%). A high value of ash is indicative of possible mineral impurity. Cellulose content present in sisal fibre was 90.08% which was higher than of bhimal fibre (86.7%) but less than that of fibre of cotton (97.5%).  NATURAL YARNS AND DYES Fig. 1.
