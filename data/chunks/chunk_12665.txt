   Promotion of ‘Good management Practices’ particularly for seed spices like cumin, fennel, coriander and fruits to reduce cost and pesticide residues; and enhance acceptability in local and international markets.   Establishment of export-oriented farm hubs for cumin, fenugreek, onion, etc.   Safe and hygienic drying of vegetables like chillies through solar driers for good quality and better prices. Irrigated North Western Plain (Ib):   IFS components may include early maturing crops pearl millet, moth bean, cowpea; cluster bean, wheat, barley, mustard, kinnow, pomegranate, ber, lasoda, vegetables, buffalo, improved cow breeds, goats, etc.   Groundwater (GW) utilization is only 45% in Ganganagar district. Emphasis on conjunctive use of GW and canal water. Promote use of pressurized irrigation technology. Save water for other areas.   Discourage cultivation of high water requiring crops like rice, groundnut and castor in arid region and use the saved water for high value crops like fruits, vegetables, protected agriculture, fodder for livestock, etc.   Planting of widely spaced crops like cotton should be encouraged using drip irrigation.   Boundary plantation of teak/shelterbelts for improving micro-climate particularly for orchards.   Emphasis on commercial dairying as fodder supply will not be an issue.   Hybrid seed production of pearl millet during summer season in irrigated areas.   Value addition to kinnow and other citrus fruits, date palm and arid fruits, vegetables, etc. Waxing of kinnow increases its self-life.   High temperature during maturity stage of rabi crops has started adversely affecting their yields. Promotion of high temperature tolerant/ short duration varieties of rabi crops. Hyper Arid Partially Irrigated Zone (Ic):   Strengthening fodder supply.   Rejuvenation of grasslands. .   Establishing fodder banks. 469 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022   Transporting dry stover from other areas e.g. Punjab where dry stover is burnt.   Strengthening of fodder supply system.   Date palm in canal command area only. Value addition to date palm and arid fruits.   Tharparkar, Rathi cattle in rainfed areas and Buffalos in irrigated areas.   Promotion of early maturing varieties of native crops.   Boundary plantation/shelterbelts for improving micro-climate.   Solar farming (agri-voltaic system).   Conservation of soil and water in Khadin systems in Jaisalmer and linking it with crop production.   Income generation from wastelands through cultivation of hardy medicinal plants like senna and timber trees that also reduce wind erosion.   Promotion of commercial dairying in canal command areas.   Promotion of better breeds of sheep and goats for rearing in rainfed areas of Jaisalmer and Bikaner districts. Prolific sheep strain Avishaan, having 30% more body weight and meat yield over single lamb bearing Malpura sheep, will be promoted for meat purpose.
