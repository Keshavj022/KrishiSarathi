 Crop Production In rainfed areas, two sprays of 2% urea or DAP one at flower initiation and 10 days thereafter proved effective in increasing grain yield of chickpea significantly. A simple regeneration and genetic transformation system has been perfected for developing transgenics in chickpea. The system involves multiple shoot induction from apical shoot meristem, followed by transformation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, carrying plasmids with different selectable markers. Chickpea genotypes K 85, BG 256, K 850 and C 235 have been transformed, carrying various plasmids having Cry 1Ab (Bt gene), with ppt and kanamycin resistance marker genes. A simple system of micro-grafting has also been developed to establish transformed shoots. TRANSGENICS IN CHICKPEA Multiple shoot induction from embryonic chickpea axis after transformation with a marker gene For bold-seeded kabuli chickpea in soils having less than 15 kg available P/ha, 60 kg P2O5/ha proved beneficial. Kabuli chickpea BG 1003 intercropped with mustard Vardan in 6 : 2 row ratio was most productive (2.09 tonnes chickpea equivalent/ha) and remunerative system, with benefit : cost ratio of 4 : 1. Chickpea after rice responded to higher 30 : 60 : 30 kg NPK/ha and deep ploughing. In rainfed areas, grain yield showed significant correlation with total biomass, number of pods and branches. Branch number was one of the principal components determining yield variation. Crop Protection IPC 99-13, IPC 99-34 and IPCK 96-3 have been identified as promising donors for resistant to Fusarium wilt. PBG 34, PBG 127, IPC 95-2, IPC 97-1 and IPC 99-10 exhibited stable resistance to race 2 (Kanpur) of Fusarium wilt. IPC 99-10 chickpea exhibits stable resistance to Fusarium wilt (Race 2) CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 37 Three variants of Rhizoctonia bataticola causing dry-root rot have been identified. Trichoderma viride (4 g) + vitavax (1 g) effectiveness per kg of seed in controlling Fusarium wilt and root rot has been confirmed. Chickpea intercropping with mustard or linseed or coriander combined with alternate spray of NSKE (5%) â€“NPV (250 LE) or Endosulfan was highly effective in managing Helicoverpa armigera. PIGEONPEA Crop Improvement Two varieties of pigeonpea have been identified. IPA 04 pigeonpea with multiple resistance to Fusarium udum, Alternaria blight, Meloidogyne incognita and Heterodera cajani, and IPA 2000-1 with resistance to F. udum and sterility mosaic have been identified. Pigeonpea genotypes T 21, Bahar and UPAS 120 have been transformed carrying various plasmids having number of gene constructs, including Cry 1Ab (Bt gene). GT 288A and 67A have been confirmed as stable cytoplasmic male steriliy (CMS) lines. A few fertility restorers have also been identified for GT 288A. Crop Production Short-duration pigeonpea with wheat adds to 30 kg N/ha in the soil.
