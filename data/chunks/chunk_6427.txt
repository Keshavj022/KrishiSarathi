 Management of flower/ fruit drop in pomegranate: Spray schedule for flower/fruit drop in pomegranate was standardized. Spray application of 2, 4-D@20 ppm resulted in minimum fruit drop (19.8 flowers/ tree), percent fruit drop (10.67%), and highest fruit set (59.12%) and number of fruits (97.90 fruits/tree) besides highest yield (26.59 kg /tree). Integrated nutrient management in sweet orange: An integrated nutrient management schedule in sweet orange was standardized. Application of 50% N (Inorganic source) + 50 % N (Organic source - Vermicompost) + 100 % P and K (100 % Inorganic - P and K supplied through Vermicompost) in sweet orange planted at 6 m × 6 m spacing resulted in significantly maximum canopy volume (20.94 m3), plant height (3.45 m) and fruit weight (180.69 g) under Rahuri, Maharashtra conditions. However, by reducing the spacing between plants by 40 % (6 m × 4 m), significantly maximum number of fruits per tree (300), fruit yield (18.56 t/ ha) and B:C ratio (1.48) was recorded by using 75 % N (Inorganic source) + 25% N (FYM) + 100% P and K (through FYM) under Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh conditions. 58.13 kg/tree), number of fruits (433.3 and 483 fruits/ tree), fruit weight (180.19 and 120.25 g), productivity (21.53 t/ha and 23.25 t/ha) and B:C ratio (2.82 and 4.57) under Sriganganagar (Rajasthan) and Tinsukia (Assam) conditions, respectively. Fruit thinning for improvement in quality of apple fruits under tall spindle training System: Two varieties (standard and spur) of apple, viz. Gala Redlum and Super Chief on M9-T339 rootstock planted at 3 m × 1 m spacing, trained in tall spindle system were manual thinned. Maximum fruit weight (171.10 g), fruit length (67.21 mm), fruit diameter (72.31 mm) and firmness (63.26 RI) was observed by retaining one fruit per cluster in variety Gala Redlum. Similarly, maximum fruit weight (198.15 g), fruit length (68.21 mm), fruit diameter (77.02 mm) and firmness (76.93 RI) was recorded in Super Chief variety by retaining one fruit per cluster. Coconut-based integrated farming system: Integration of coconut with pasture crops (Cumbu Napier hybrid + Desmanthus), fodder trees (Sesbania grandiflora + Leucaena leucocephala + Glyricidia) and Tellicherry breed of goats recorded net income of . 2,54,206/ha with BC ratio of 3.16 as compared to . 1,51,312/ha with BC ratio of 2.25 in the monocrop of coconut under Aliyarnagar conditions. Integrated nutrient management in coconut: Site Specific Nutrient Management with secondary (CaSO4. 2H2O @ 1 kg and MgSO4@ 500 g/palm per year) + Micronutrient mixture (FeSO4, MnSO4, CuSO4, ZnSO4, Borax and ammonoium molybdate) @ 1 kg/palm/year + Coconut frond mulching + Azospirillum@ 100 g + Phosphobacteria @100 g + VAM@100 g/palm/year enhanced productivity by 32 % over farmers’ practice in tender nut variety Chowghat Orange Dwarf. Net returns and benefit cost ratio were R 4.38 lakhs/ha and 2.99 in INM package as against R 3.10 lakhs/ha and 2.66 in farmer’s practice, respectively.
