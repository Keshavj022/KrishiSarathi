 Based on the ESM method, the vertical stock of SOC and TN for four land use practices are given in Table 2. For all the treatments, the storage of SOC (Mg ha−1) increased significantly with soil depth increase, and the storage of SOC was lowest at the soil surface and highest at the bottom of the soil surface. Among the treatments, forest (56.56 ± 1.90) had significantly higher SOC storage than CA (42.84 ± 0.27, ZT and 41.41 ± 1.84, RT) and CT (41.33 ± 1.19). However, ZT and RT had significantly higher storage than CT up to 20 cm soil depth; beyond that, there were no significant differences. The storage of SOC followed the trend Forest>ZT > RT > CT. Similarly, TN storage (Mg ha−1) increases significantly with an increment in soil depth, and among land uses, the highest TN was observed with forest and the lowest with CT. The storage of TN followed the trend, forest>ZT > RT > CT. At the surface (0–5 cm), the storage of TN for forest (1.20 ± 0.09) and ZT (0.77 ± 0.02) were significantly different from each other and also from the other two land uses. Beyond 10 cm soil depth, the storage of TN for ZT, RT, and CT did not vary significantly. Because SOC and TN storage along the soil profile was associated with SRs, they rose concurrently with SR levels. The increased SOC and TN stocks in the soil surface in CA may be due to higher residue retention in the surface soil than in CT (Xue et al., 2015). The findings show that the CA practices improve the surface SOM storage compared to the CT practices, and the same trend was also re­ ported by Patra et al. (2019a) in cereal-based cropping systems. Similar results of higher SOM storage in CA practices were also observed by other experts (Chao et al., 2019; Patra et al., 2019a; Liu et al., 2020). Overall, the results indicated that, while SOM storage was reduced owing to the conversion of land use from forest to CT, adopting CA approaches improved SOM storage compared to CT practices. The SOC concentration and MWD were significantly positively correlated (R2 = 0.82, p-value <0.001 and Fig. 7(a)), and both the Fig. 5. Stratification ratio of MWD (mm) under different land use practices (Forest, ZT, RT, and CT). The bars present mean ± SD (m = 3). The different uppercase alphabets imply significant differences across treatments for a given soil depth, and the lowercase alphabets imply significant differences across the soil depths for a given treatment (P < 0.05).
