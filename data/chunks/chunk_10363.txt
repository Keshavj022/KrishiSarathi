 The concept of integrated control in India was propounded by Dr. S. Pradhan in 1969. Pest management at field level in India was initiated in 1975 with introduction of Operational Research Programme (ORP) on cotton and rice. India became member of FAO-country programme in 1980s and adopted IPM as a national policy in 1985. The FAO–Inter country programme was started in rice during 1993 simultaneously with IPM programme in cotton by CABI. Bio–intensive IPM (BIPM) is being promoted for a sustainable insect pest management since1985. Location specific successful strategies of IPM for various field, commercial, vegetable and fruit crops have been developed, validated and disseminated with proven economic and ecological benefits in the country. The milestones in insect pest management as listed in Table 1. Table 1. Milestones in the area of insect pest management Year Milestone 1914 The Destructive Insect Pest Act was introduced. 1951 Classical biological control of cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi through predatory Rodolia cardinalis. 1962 Discovery of antifeedant properties of neem against desert locust. 1963 Detection of first case of insecticide resistance development against DDT in Singhara beetle. 1968 The Insecticides Act No. 46 was introduced to regulate the import, manufacture, sale, transport, distribution and use of insecticides with a view to prevent risk to human beings or animals, and for matters connected therewith. 1969 The concept of ‘Integrated Control’ in India propounded by Dr. S. Pradhan. 1970 Introduction of synthetic pyrethroids. 1971 Insecticide Rules (GSR 1650, DT. 9-10-1971): In exercise of the powers conferred by section 36 of the Insecticides Act, 1968 (46 of 1968), the Central Government, after con- sultation with the Central Insecticides Board, made the rules. 1975 Pest management at field level initiated in India with implementation of operational re- search programme (ORP) in cotton and rice. 1980 India became member of FAO-country programme. 1982 Introduction of Epiricania melanoleuca, a parasitoid of Pyrilla perpusilla into Gujarat from Maharashtra and Haryana on sugarcane. 1985 Adoption of ‘Integrated Pest Management’ (IPM) as national policy for crop protection. 1993 FAO–Inter country programme started in rice during 1993, simultaneously with IPM pro- gramme in cotton by CABI.
