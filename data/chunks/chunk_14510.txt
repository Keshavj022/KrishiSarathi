 Data was collected from 10 randomly selected households from 25 randomly selected villages across 36 districts in Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. For each season, households were sampled inde­ pendently. This led to a total of 18,000 household – cropping season observations of which 16,016 were retained after quality control (see Fig. 1). We analyzed the household survey data from the 2017–2018 rice- wheat-rice season in the EGP with the following crop-year combina­ tion: rice-wheat = 16,016; thereof rice: n = 8589 and wheat: n = 7427. Among wheat farmers, 81% grew rice before wheat, while 75% of rice farmers grew wheat as the previous crop in 2017 and 84% in 2018. The second largest category of previous crops grown was ‘fallow’ for both rice and wheat. Rabi rice was not considered in this study. Land frag­ mentation poses challenges to collecting production data from small­ holder environments as management may vary from plot to plot. We simplified the analysis by assuming that farmers applied the same management practices and obtained the same yields as on their largest plot across all plots (Fraval et al., 2019; Niroula and Thapa, 2005). Furthermore, as is common with similar datasets, farmers’ inaccurate estimates of landholding and very small plot sizes can cause large pos­ itive outliers, which we removed by consecutively trimming off house­ holds in the 99th percentile of affected variables (i.e., IBI, FPDI, landholding size, and profits). This procedure resulted in a total dataset of 15,572 records (rice: 8244; wheat: 7328). Demographically, educa­ tional status of respondents shows that the sample reflects a diversity of backgrounds: masters (1.6%), bachelors (8.7%), secondary school (11%), primary school (30%), matriculation (21%), no schooling (27%). Precipitation was average for the rice season 2017, with a Stan­ dardized Precipitation Index (SPI) ~0, and below average for the wheat 2018 and rice 2018 season, SPI ~ −1 to −3 (IRI, 2020). This means that our data only partially account for weather factors and therefore can only offer limited inference regarding resilience and robustness pro­ vided by increased irrigation intensities to the rice-wheat systems of the EGP. Specifically, the data offer ‘high side’ estimates of irrigation ad­ vantages due to prevailing climate conditions. 2.2. Profit estimation for fully subsidized irrigation and intensification benefit index 2.2.1. Intensification benefit index To analyze the effect of increased use of irrigation on household incomes, we first calculated the Intensification Benefit Index (IBI) of households (Harris, 2019). The IBI indicates what a farm household earns in dollar per day terms (US$/person/day) from generic farm sys­ tem profitability values expressed in dollar returns per ha per year terms (US$/ha/year) and is a function of farm size and household size (Eq. (1)).
