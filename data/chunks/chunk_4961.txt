The bulk density of soil at 0-15, 15-30, 30-45 and 45-60 cm depths was 1.14, 1.25, 1.47 and 1.45 mg/m3 respectively in the orchard area. The average particle density of the soil was 2.61 mg/m3. The porosity of soil was thus high, especially in the top 30 cm soil layer. Consequently, the soil was highly permeable for water. The infiltration rate of soil (after 6 hours of initiation of infiltration process) varied between 5,379 and 7,005 mm/d.s The `A' frame exercise was undertaken in the field after constructing by using the indigenous materials of the area (Fig. 4). It was also observed that there was deviation in the contour and the planting stock. On planning in the field it was observed that though the data show the variation Fig. 4. Contour survey using `A' frame of more than 7 m but on rough plotting it came out to be crossing of the contours. Importance value index exercise of the area To cover the species diversity and heterogeneity in the SALT and non-SALT areas under study, phyto-sociological studies were carried out for different plant species occurring in those areas. In the non-SALT area, there was much species diversity. In addition to many grasses (12 species), shrubs like Rumex, Rubus, Rosa and Berberis spp. were also found. The ecological success of a species in the area appeared to be a function of its cumulative dispersion, numerical strength and relative dominance values, and the minor variations in dispersion or relative dominance failed to affect the order. Higher numerical strength of Rosa sp. in non-SALT areas as compared to that of Rumex sp. failed to generate a variation in IVI order (Table 2). Species diversity was greatly reduced in the SALT-managed areas. Ecological success of a species was dependent upon the nature of the species with which it is associated in an area. It was interesting to note that grass Agropyron canaliculatus was ecologically more successful when grown in association with different grasses and shrubs in non- SALT areas as compared to when it was existing in association with apple trees in SALT areas (Table 3).
