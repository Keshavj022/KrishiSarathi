 The first irrigation must be applied at crown root initiation stage (20-25 days after sowing) of the crop and the second one at heading stage (70-75 days after sowing). Irrigation should be avoided when ground water table remains within 50 cm of the root zone. Maize In case hybrids maize, it is advised not to keep seeds from previous year’s harvest for sowing in the following years. However, seeds from composite varieties can be kept for sowing in the following year, without appreciable decrease in yield. Well drained sandy loam soil is to be selected, Field should be free from water logging. Optimum time of sowing is middle of September to middle of November. Spacing of 60 cm between rows and 20 cm between plants should be maintained. Buckwheat Optimum time of sowing is September-October for Upper Brahmaputra Valley Zone and October-Mid November for Lower Brahmaputra Valley Zone. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 235 Seed rate is 20 kg/ha (2.7 kg/bigha) and spacing is 30 cm between rows is recommended. Foxtail millet Optimum time of sowing is middle of January to middle of February (the best time is last week of January). Seed rate is 8-10 kg/ha, which may be increased to 15 kg/ha under broadcast sowing. Spacing should be 25 cm between rows. Lentil Newly recommended varieties are HUL 57 (small seed lentil variety), Axom Masur 1 (SL 2-24) and Axom Masur 2 (SL 2-28). Optimum time of sowing is mid-October to mid-November and recommended seed rate is 30 kg/ha or 4 kg/bigha. The seeds are to be sown in line at a spacing of 25 cm between rows and 5-7 cm from seed to seed. Rapeseed and Mustard Recommended toria varieties are TS 36, TS 38, and M-27 with 90 -95 days duration. Newly recommended varieties suitable for late sowing are Jeuti, TS 46 and TS 67. Some newly recommended Indian Mustard varieties are NRCHB – 101, PM 26 and PM 27 having crop duration of 107 days. Optimum seed rate is 10 kg/ha (1.3 kg/bigha) for toria and seed rate will be 8 kg/ha for mustard. A seed proportion of 75:25 of toria + lentil mixed is recommended for Hills Zone only. As pure crop, a seed rate of 6-8 kg/ha is recommended for Hills Zone. Seed rate of rainfed late sown toria after sali paddy (rice-toria sequence) should be 13 kg/ha, i.e., 33% higher than normal recommended rate of 10 kg/ha. The optimum time of sowing is middle of October to middle of November. Early sowing helps in escaping the attack of aphids. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 236 In Barak Valley Zone, rapeseed and mustard can be sown as late as November 30 in upland condition and up to third week of November in medium upland condition. Irrigation of 6 cm depth of water may be applied either at 50% flowering or at early siliqua formation stage. In case a rainfall of 20- 25 mm is received during this period, no post sowing irrigation is essential. Pre-sowing irrigation is normally not required for timely sown crop. However, in dry areas, pre-sowing irrigation may be applied.
