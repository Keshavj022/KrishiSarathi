 The antibody level remained higher in third and fourth week and the OD values were almost 3–4 times more than the controls. Characterization of somatic antigen of H. contortus by SDS-PAGE revealed polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 16–69 kDa of which 26 kDa appeared to be common PATENTS FILED BY IVRI WITH CONTROLLER OF PATENTS, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA l An Asian linkage liver attenuated homologus vaccine for peste des petits ruminants (PPR) virus infection. l Indigenously developed cost-effective and potent aluminum hydroxide gel concentrated oil adjuvanted vaccine for foot-and-mouth disease. l Indigenous drug formulation against skin disease of animals.

DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 112 between Bunostomum trigonocephalum and Oesophagostomum columbianum and H. contortus. Double immunodiffusion test with hyperimmune serum raised against somatic antigen of H. contortus showed double precipitin lines with the homologous antigen. Similarly hyperimmune serum raised against O. columbianum with its homologous antigen showed two precipitin lines, whereas, homologous antigen of B. trigonocephalum showed single precipitin line. Serially diluted (1 : 200 and 1 : 400) sera of infected and control groups of goat when subjected to different H. contortus antigen showed variable OD values in ELISA. Maximum OD value could be recorded with soluble larval extract during III week (0.647 ± 0.08) and IV week (0.90 ± 0.14) in the infected group, whereas, in the control group it was 0.250 ± 0.021. In sheep and goats SDS–PAGE analysis of somatic antigen of different GI nematodes H. contortus revealed 16, 19, 22, 26, 32, 39, 50 and 69 kDa protein, B. trigonocephalum 15, 19, 26, 31, 50, 56, 63 and 71 kDa, and O. columbianum 16, 22, 20, 26, 42, 64 kDA. Most prominent band of 26 kDa was common to all antigens. In soluble larval extract antigen of H. contortus 83 kDa protein band was the most prominent. These proteins of 26 kDA and 83 kDA need further investigation for immunodiagnostic potential. Among alternate control methods, spray of low level (1.25 g nitrogen%) urea on pasture significantly reduced the translation of worm eggs to infective larvae on single as well as continuously contaminated pastures. Among nematophagus fungi, Duddingtonia flagrans trapped the nematode larvae to the extent of 98% in 24– 48 hr postinoculation whereas Arthrobotys oligospora, trapped only 67% larvae in 144 hr Pl.
