, pesticides, heavy metals and antibiotics content, socio-economic status and sediment retention/loss were studied during the year and the salient results are presented below: Fish diversity: A total of 70 species comprising 20 brackish water species from the estuarine areas, 47 freshwater species from the river stretch and 3 crustacean species were recorded. The fishes belonged to 12 orders, 33 families and 53 genera. Perciformes was the most dominant order (12 families) followed by Siluriformes (5 families). Cyprinidae was the most dominant family (18 species, 26%), followed by family Bagridae (6 species, 9%). In the samples collected it was found that four species belonged to Near Threatened category and one species each belonged to the Endangered and Vulnerable category. Diversity studies indicated that maximum species and number is present in West Godavari district (Table 5). Being an estuarine area, Richness index too was the highest in this district. Evenness values indicated a slight uneven distribution of species in all the three districts. However, Dominance index values revealed no dominance of any species in all the three districts indicating stable environments, which was corroborated by Equitability index values. Shannon Weiner Diversity indices were higher (>3) for West Godavari and Adilabad indicating good diversity. Individual Rarefaction curve (Fig. 2) indicated that in West Godavari and Adilabad districts, the chances of getting more species by more sampling is low while in Karimnagar district there is a high probability of finding higher number of species with more samplings.

Odonata and Coleoptera. The aquatic insects belonging to three families viz., Dytiscidae, Gerridae and Belastomatidae were collected from all the sampled locations. The data when subjected to species diversity analysis showed that the diversity was low over all, but Karimnagar recorded relatively higher diversity index (Shannon Weiner index â€“ 1.07) richness index (Margalef richness index 1.17) and abundance of aquatic insects compared to the other two locations. Diversity of pollinators: Around ten species of insect pollinators belonging to five subfamilies of family Apidae of order Hymenoptera viz., Apis dorsata, A. cerana indica, Xylocopa fenestrata, X. pubescens, Ceratina unimaculata, Amegilla violacea, A. confusa, A. zonata, Nomia sp and Nomia curvipes were found foraging in the area.
