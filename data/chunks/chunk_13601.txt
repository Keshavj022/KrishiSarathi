 The coefﬁcient a3 is interpreted as the impact on network beneﬁciaries of capacity-building programs, and captures the effect of such programs only. 5. Results and discussion 5.1. KVKs’ impact on the adoption of HD-2967: Effects on KVK beneﬁciaries Table 5 presents the impact estimates of frontline demonstra- tions on primary or secondary beneﬁciaries from adopting a mod- ern wheat variety, namely HD-2967. Columns 1 and 2 present the matched difference-in-differences estimates with and without a time-varying district control.30 In Column 1, the coefﬁcient a1 shows a 16 % increase in adoption of HD-2967 between 2015–16 and 2017–18. The coefﬁcient a2 captures the difference in adoption of HD-2967 between beneﬁciaries and non-beneﬁciaries in 2015–16. Consistent with the covariates balance, the difference in the adop- tion rate of HD-2967 between primary or secondary beneﬁciaries and non-beneﬁciaries was insigniﬁcant in 2015–16 (before the frontline demonstration intervention program). Our coefﬁcient of interest, a3, measures the impact of frontline demonstrations on the adoption of HD-2967. Primary or secondary beneﬁciaries have about 22 % higher adoption rates than non-beneﬁciaries. In other words, this study indicates that exposure to frontline demonstra- tions increases the adoption rate of new technology by about 22 %. This interpretation relies on the conditional independence assumption. In other words, it is conditional on similar covariates and no omitted time-varying and district- or village-speciﬁc effects being correlated with frontline demonstration interventions. Note that selection of a village in the program is based on the number of small and marginal farmers residing in it. Therefore, the estimate may potentially be confounded with the mean reversion in the absence of frontline demonstrations. We partly address this by including the average land size at the village level as a covariate while conducting a matching procedure.
