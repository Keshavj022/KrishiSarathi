 litura larvae upon treatments of different toxins at 10 ppm as compared with control in laboratory bioassays on semi- synthetic diet under controlled condition (temperature 25±2°C, RH 50±10%). (a) Chemically synthesized zinc nanoparticles; (b) Bioaccumulation of ZnO nanoparticles in chickpea leaves; and (c) Comparison between dose 1 (25 ppm) and dose 2 (100 ppm) vs PC in ZIF-1 gene. a b c ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 70 recommended for the management of cotton whitefly in the laboratory and field conditions. Overall, EPF strains Beauveria bassiana (Bb)-4511, Cordyceps javanica (Cj)- 102, and Metarhizium anisopliae (Ma)-1299, were found compatible with full and half doses of the chemical and botanicals and showed highest nymphal mortality (80- 95%) at on-station polyhouse and field trials (2017-18 and 2020-21). The oil-based formulations of Cj-102, Ma- 1299, and Bb-4511 were developed and further evaluated for three consecutive seasons under AICRP on Cotton at multilocation trials (2020-21 to 2022-23) under IPM and Biomodule treatments. These three bioinsecticide formulations exhibited better bioefficacy in terms of insect mortality; their compatibility with chemical/ botanical insecticides can cause increased stress, immunocompromise and alteration in insect physiology (mortality and fecundity) under field conditions. These novel oil-based formulations are water-dispersible liquid bio-insecticides having >1 × 108 cfu/ml with good tank mixing/stability (48 hr), and a shelf life of >12 months. Upto 86.3%, reduction in whitefly nymphal and adult population, 15-30% reduction in CLCuD severity and 20-50% increase in seed cotton yield was recorded under conventional, IRM/IPM and organic/natural cotton cultivation systems. The ICBR on net income under IPM and biomodule ranged from 1.9 to 2.2. The formulations have the scope as an alternative solution for whitefly CLCuD vector in cotton under IPM and organic farming system. The following three ICAR- CICR technologies of the above mentioned formulations can be commercialized after the generation of toxicological data: ICAR-CS-CICR-Technology- 2023-025: Oil-based entomopathogenic fungal bio-insecticide formulation (Beauveria bassiana CICR RS-Bb-4511 @108 cfu/ml): CICR Cotpest Guard-2 (NAIMCC-F-04402); ICAR-CS-CICR- Technology-2023-026: Oil-based entomo- pathogenic fungal bio-insecticide formulation (Cordyceps javanica–CICR-RSS-Cj-0102 @108 cfu/ml): CICR Cotpest Guard-1 (ITCC-10499.17) and ICAR- CS-CICR-Technology-2023-027: Oil-based entom- opathogenic fungal bio-insecticide formulation (Metarhizium anisopliae CICR-RS-Ma-1299 @1×108 cfu/ml): CICR Green Guard-1 (NAIMCC-F-04455). CROP MANAGEMENT Effect of temperature on growth inhibition of Trichoderma isolates: On the basis of antagonistic effects, CJMR180, CJMR191, and CJMR193 isolates of Trichoderma were found promising against M. phaseolina, Rhizoctonia sp. and Sclerotium sp., causing diseases in flax and jute.
