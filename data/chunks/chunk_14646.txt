 A total of 27 strains showed antifungal activity against all four fungal strains, with six strains viz., S. pilosus TN4 (Fig. 4), S. tendae TN8, S. araujoniae TN11, N. das- sonvillei TN12 S. araujoniae TN19 and S. griseus TN27 showing con- siderable percent inhibition against all the four pathogens tested, while 33 strain showed antifungal activity against atleast three fungal strains. 3.7. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers The 16S rRNA gene sequences of 65 strains identiﬁed in the cur- rent study have been submitted to the GenBank nucleotide sequence database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide). All the strains isolated and characterized in this study were submitted to NAIMCC (National Agriculturally Important Microbial Culture Collection, ICAR-NBAIM, India (Table 2). 4. Discussion Actinomycetes are endowed with metabolic potential to survive and prosper in varied environments including agricultural ﬁelds where their presence impacts the survival and growth of other bac- teria, as well as plants (Verma et al., 2011; Sadeghi et al., 2012; Bennur et al., 2016; Olanrewaju and Babalola, 2019; Ma et al., 2020). Among the actinomycetes, the genus Streptomyces is endowed with a plethora of metabolic capabilities and hence con- sidered as bacteria of immense importance both in natural envi- ronments and Industry. To explore the potential of this group of bacteria it is necessary to understand their diversity, physiology, and ecology (Ma et al., 2020). The aim of this study was to specif- ically isolate Streptomyces and study their genetic and cultural diversity and explore their antifungal potential against various phytopathogens. A selective media was used to isolate Strepto- myces spp. from crops’ rhizosphere and bulk soil collected from dif- ferent ﬁelds and different regions of Tamil Nadu, India. A total of 65 putative Streptomyces isolates were collected, characterized, and identiﬁed. Identiﬁcation based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similar- ity revealed the isolates fall under two genera viz., Streptomyces M. Kumar, P. Tiwari, M.T. Zeyad et al. Journal of King Saud University – Science 35 (2023) 102619 5 and Nocardiopsis. It’s worth noting that the 16S rRNA gene sequence’s utility as a phylogenetic and taxonomy identiﬁer is restricted. The core genome divergence between Streptomyces strains with 97 percent 16S rRNA gene sequence identity can be as high as 30 %, with an ANI of 100–78.3 % (van Bergeijk et al., 2020). 16S rRNA gene sequence identity of 98.6 % is widely used Fig. 2.
