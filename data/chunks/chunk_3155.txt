 RF+2t FYM (in seed furrows)+40 kg S+25 kg ZnSO4+1 kg boron + Azotobactor (seed treatment) should be followed for achieving higher seed yield of mustard over recommended fertility level at Shillongani in Zone V. • Application of 2 to FYM/ha (in furrows)+40 kg S/ha (through gypsum) over 75% of recommended fertility was found more remunerative in moong‐mustard cropping sequence and is recommended for North Gujarat condition. Crop Protection • Bulb extract of Allium sativum 1%(w/v) and Eucalyptus globosus 1%(w/v) individually has been found to be at par (P<0.05) with fungicidal check mancozeb in disease reduction and in increasing yield and hence either of them may be recommended for the control of Alternaria blight and white rust disease management. www.icar.org.in 15 2002 ‐ 2007 Front line demonstrations • A total of 1480 frontline demonstrations on improved production and protection technologies were conducted in 13 states of India during 2002‐03 to 2004‐05. The productivity improvement varied form 13‐106. The productivity, which was 902 kg/ha in 2002‐03, increased to 1117 kg/ha in 2005‐06. www.icar.org.in 16 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science All India Network Project on Arid Legumes 1.
