Some of RCTs for maize sowing are: Zero-till planting: Maize can be grown under no-till condition with saving in diesel and time resulting in reduced cost of cultivation, reduced environmental pollution, higher farm productivity and better resource use efficiency. It is necessary to ensure good soil moisture at sowing for better germination and good early crop stand. Raised bed/Ridge planting: As maize is sensitive to excess as well as water deficient conditions, planting maize on raised beds is considered best planting method. Sowing can be done on southern side of east-west ridges/beds. Under excess/ water logging conditions, furrow act as drainage channels. To exploit full potential of bed planting, sowing can be done without any preparatory tillage on permanent beds. Raised beds/ ridges can save 20-30% irrigation water and give higher crop productivity. Trench method: For ease of irrigation during dry and hot weather conditions, maize can also be sown in trenches at 60 × 20 cm spacing. In addition, it resists lodging and gives higher productivity than flat sowing. Need based nitrogen management in maize using LCC: Apply 30 kg N/ha as basal dose. After 21 days of sowing, start matching the colour of fully exposed leaf from top at 10 days interval. Whenever LCC shade less is than 5, apply 28 kg N/ha. If LCC ≥5, no need to apply nitrogen. Use of LCC can be discontinued after initiation of silking as no more nitrogen is needed. Drip irrigation: Recent studies have shown that micro-irrigation gives the higher yield than conventional method of irrigation. Maize, sunflower, gram, green gram and other grain crops can be grown by using micro-irrigation systems.
