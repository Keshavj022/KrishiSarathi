Through his determination, hard work, and the technical guidance provided by ICAR-CRIDA, he managed to turn Crossandra cultivation into a profitable venture. His success has inspired neighbouring farmers to consider Crossandra as a viable crop, improving their livelihoods as well. The Farmers FIRST Programme demonstrated its ability to create a positive impact on the income levels of small farmers like Shri Srinivas. This case illustrates how a combination of scientific advice, efficient resource management, and community support can lead to significant improvements in agricultural outcomes. Srinivas now serves as a role model for other farmers in his village, spreading awareness about the benefits of Crossandra cultivation and encouraging others to adopt similar practices for better economic returns. *Corresponding author email: g.nirmala@icar.gov.in Farmer receiving Best Farmer award on ICAR-CRIDA Foundation Day Indian Farming 36 November 2024 Azolla’s cultivation with rainwater and its effect on milk yield and quality Giridhar K*, A.
