 Stratigraphic plot of δ13CSOM, macrobotanical abundances, crop and Cyperaceae phytolith abundances, phytolith Iph index from Trench YA1/72/85. A.K. Pokharia et al. Quaternary Science Advances 13 (2024) 100155 6 4.2. Isotopic data Sediment carbon stable isotope (δ13CSOM) values display a large de­ gree of variability from −27.0 to −9.3‰ with average value of −21.1‰ ±5.1 (Fig. 4). During the Historic and Medieval (ca. 200 BCE to 1300 CE) δ13CSOM values reflect a C3 dominated environment with a mean value of −23.9‰±1.9. The Post-Medieval period (1300–1850 CE) is characterised by enriched values of −9.8‰±0.4, typical of a C4 domi­ nated agriculture. 4.3. Macrobotanical remains A total of 562236 carbonised grains/seeds/fruits were recorded and identified (Supplement 1; Supplement 2 - Fig. 3). In general, the culti­ vated plants include both winter growing crops (barley - Hordeum vul­ gare, wheat - Triticum aestivum/durum, pea - Pisum sativum, lentil - Lens culinaris, and flax - Linum usitatissimum) and summer crops (rice - Oryza sativa, sorghum - Sorghum bicolor, pearl millet - Pennisetum glaucum, broomcorn millet Panicum miliaceum, foxtail millet - Setaria italica, mung/urd bean - Vigna radiata/mungo, horse gram - Macrotyloma uni­ florum) The most common finds were rice and millets (especially Pen­ nisetum glaucum and Sorghum bicolor), but finds also include other cereal crops, pulses, fibre crops, fruits and a few wild taxa. Detailed quantities of sediment floated and remains recovered from each sample are pre­ sented in Supplement 1. The density of cereal remains per litre of sedi­ ment is 0.36/L during the Historic Phase, 0.47/L during the Medieval Phase and 1245/L during the Post-Medieval phase. In the Historic Phase I (200 BCE−500 CE) winter crops compose 4% of the total plant assemblage that was dominated by summer rice and pulses. Large-grained cereals (mainly rice) account for 95% in com­ parison with 5% for small-grained cereals/millets (Fig. 4; Supplement 2 - Figs. 4 and 5). During Phase II (500−1300 CE; MWP) large-grained cereals account for 85% whereas small-grained millets account for 15% (Fig. 4; Supplement 2 - Figs. 4 and 5). The majority of charred crop remains from these two phases are from Trench YA1/72/85 and are presented stratigraphically in Fig. 4. The Phase III (1300−1850 CE), assemblage is dominated by charred caryopses of millets (97%), mostly Pennisetum glaucum and Sorghum bicolor. Mung bean (Vigna radiata) is also well represented in this phase (Fig. 5; Supplement 2 - Figs. 4 and 5). We note that these remains are primarily recovered from a deposit containing over 500,000 carbonised grains from Trench YA1/92/73 and are presented as a single context in Fig. 5. 4.4. Phytolith data A total of nineteen phytolith morphotypes were identified (Fig. 6), excluding unidentified types. Throughout the profile the relative pro­ portion of Grass Silica Short Cells (GSSCs) was dominant, followed by other grass and non-grass cells.
