The results presented in Table 3 indicate that cumulative effect of all micro-organisms present in unsterlised fresh cowdung facilitate improvement in germination of yam, particularly after 25 days. Phenol content Phenol content of the tubers generally reduces the rate of germination due to toxicity. During Protein content in sprouted and dormant tubers The protein content of sprouted and dormant yam tubers was studied. Two samples were collected from the tissues adjacent to sprout and the lower portion of the seed tubers. One gram tissue was taken and extracted for protein estimation. The protein content in different treatments is presented in Table 5. Protein content in dormant tuber was found to be lower than in the sprouted tuber. However, when sprouting started, the protein content was  HORTICULTURAL CROPS Post-harvest tuber rot The Dioscorea (yam) tubers were subjected to storage and natural rotting. The rotted tubers were plated on petri-plates on potato dextrose agar medium under aseptic conditions. The causal organisms were transferred to PDA slants. The cultures were again plated and re-isolated. The pathogenicity of the rotting organisms was confirmed by inoculation in healthy tubers, for identical symptoms. Five major pathogens that caused post-harvest rotting of Dioscorea (yam) were identified. Of the five, four fungal pathogens, viz. Sclerotium rolfsii, Botryodiplodia theobromae, Fusarium and Rhizopus species caused considerable damage to seed tubers of yam. One bacterial pathogen Erwinia carotovora was also found to cause damage to yam tubers. Table 6.
