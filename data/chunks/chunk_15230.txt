 Ultimately, the types of smart sensors used in precision agri- culture contribute to increasing yields, conserving resources, and supporting the long-term sustainability of agriculture in the face of growing global food demands. 3. Integration of IoT and Data Analytics in Precision Agriculture The agricultural landscape has undergone a transformative evolution with the integration of IoT technology and advanced data analytics. Precision agriculture, a ground- breaking approach that leverages these technologies, has emerged as a revolutionary solution to address the challenges faced by modern farming. This integration of IoT and data analytics has paved the way for a new era of sustainable, efﬁcient, and data-driven farming practices, promising to enhance crop yields, conserve resources, and revolutionize the future of agriculture. 3.1. Internet of Things (IoT) in Agriculture. The IoT is an innovative concept that involves connecting everyday objects and devices to the Internet, enabling them to autonomously collect and exchange data. In agriculture, IoT has the capac- ity to revolutionize conventional farming methods into intel- ligent, data-driven operations. By incorporating IoT devices and sensors into agricultural practices, farmers gain imme- diate access to real-time data on their crops, soil conditions, and environmental factors. This facilitates better decision- making and enhances overall productivity. The framework for IoT Integration in agriculture is shown in Figure 2. 3.1.1. Precision Farming. IoT sensors deployed across ﬁelds monitor variables such as soil moisture, temperature, humid- ity, and nutrient levels. These data are transmitted to a cen- tral platform, empowering farmers to make precise decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. Precision agriculture maximizes resource efﬁciency, reduces waste, and improves crop yields. 3.1.2. Smart Irrigation. IoT-connected irrigation systems adjust water distribution based on real-time data, including soil moisture levels and weather forecasts. By ensuring that crops receive the appropriate amount of water at the suitable moment, smart irrigation conserves water and energy while fostering more robust plant growth. 3.1.3. Livestock Monitoring. IoT devices equipped with GPS and health sensors track the location and health status of livestock. Farmers can remotely monitor their animals’ well-being, identify early signs of illness, and optimize feed- ing schedules, thereby enhancing animal welfare and farm management. 3.1.4. Crop Health Monitoring. Drones equipped with cam- eras and sensors can ﬂy over ﬁelds, capturing high-resolution images and data on crop health.
