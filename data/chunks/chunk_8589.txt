89 g for 28 and 40 weeks of age, respectively, for both the lines. The frequency distribution of egg production up to 40 weeks of age indicated that 62 to 73% of birds laid more than 100 eggs as compared to only 32% in control birds, indicating the efficiency of selection method used. The heritability estimates of age at sexual maturity, body weight at 18 and 40 weeks of age, egg weight at 28 and 40 weeks of age and egg production up to 40 weeks of age were low to moderate in magnitude, with the evidence of dominance and or maternal effect in inheritance of body weight at 18 and 40 weeks of age in IWH line and all the traits in IWI line. LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 105 the control. The residual feed consumption per day, a multiple regression of egg mass production, weight gain and metabolic body size was 2.36 g in IWK and 1.72 g in control. Heritability of egg production and feed efficiency was low. Genetic correlations of part period egg production with feed efficiency traits in IWK line were in general negative, indicating that any attempt to improve feed efficiency will result in improvement of egg production efficiency. The average feed consumed per day, feed per dozen egg, and feed per kg egg mass production during 21–40 weeks of age were 88.2 g and 95.4 g; 1,382 g and 1,556 g and 2,332 g and 2,974 g in IWK and control lines respectively. The feed consumption was reduced by 7 g in selected lines and the feed requirement was less by 174 g to produce a dozen eggs or 642 g less to produce 1 kg egg mass. Evaluation of strain crosses of layers: Two- and three-way crosses were generated utilizing the available pure lines. HI combination was better for production up to 40 weeks of age. The reciprocal crosses differed in degree of manifestation of heterosis suggesting influence of both maternal and sex-linked effects. Three-way crosses almost performed equally till 40 weeks of age and the egg weight recorded at 28 and 40 weeks of age was around 1 g and 1.5 g more, respectively, in KIH cross combination. Analysis of a resource egg type population for quantitative, immunogenic and molecular profiling: Three sub populations were produced with inbreeding infused in FS and HS groups @ 0.25 and 0.13 per generation, respectively, apart from the usual non-inbred group. As envisaged, these constituted the genotypic groups with varying degree of homogeneity, moving towards establishing near-congenic layer populations for the B-haplotyping studies. Poultry for Meat The synthetic broiler dam line (SDL) at the CARI, Izatnagar, has undergone 12 generations of selection. The fertility was 81.2% and hatchability per cent of TES and FES were 65.3 and 80.5%, respectively. The mean body weights at 4, 5, 6, 20 and 24 weeks of age were 880.3 ± 2.5, 1048.74 ± 3.70, 1341.80 ± 27.88, 2875.93 ± 11.42 and 2876 ± 11.9 g, respectively. The heritability estimates for body weights at 4 and 5 weeks were 0.194 ± 0.046 and 0.12 ± 0.032, respectively.
