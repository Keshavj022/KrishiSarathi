Source: ICAR-Annual Report 2022-23 March–April 2024 39 Establishing an Export Value-chain of Watermelon to Dubai Market Watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum and Nakai] is an important speciality crop accounting for seven percent of the agricultural area devoted to vegetable crops globally. The world watermelon harvested area is about 3.50 million hectares with a production of 117 million tonnes (FAO, 2017). Asia-Pacific accounts for 85% of this production (98.6 million tonnes). India has witnessed a watermelon revolution over the last two decades (2001-2019) with over 820% increase in production and the current production is pegged at 2.5 million tonnes (NHB, 2022). The article discusses the successful collaboration of ICAR-IIHR and a private company, Fit Fresh, in exporting watermelon from India to Dubai Market. I CAR-Indian Institute of Horticultural Research, Bengaluru is a pioneer research institute working on watermelon for over 5 decades. It is the National Active Germplasm Site (NAGS) with global germplasm resources of over 500 accessions of watermelon. Crop improvement of watermelon at ICAR-IIHR resulted in the development of several popular varieties. Notable among them is a triple disease resistant watermelon variety, Arka Manik which has been well adopted in India and also several South Asian nations. Recently an open pollinated ice box variety named Arka Shyama was developed at the institute. Productivity doubled to 24.9 t/ha due to wide scale adoption of precision farming practices like transplanting, mulching, drip irrigation, fertigation, etc. Especially, watermelon market in India has transformed over the last decade with the emergence of ice box and mini seeded types catering to nearly 50% of total production.
