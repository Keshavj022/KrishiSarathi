Technology Global Use Use in India Challenges in India Drones Developed countries extensively utilise this technology for field mapping, monitoring crop health, and conducting spraying operations. Regulatory frameworks are being built to govern economic activities. The government is implementing steps to promote the use of "Kisan Drones" for tasks such as digitising land records, spraying crops, and assessing crop conditions. Small farms have not widely adopted the technology due to its high cost and regulatory requirements. The broader use of this technology is hindered by regulatory obstacles, concerns regarding privacy, and the reliance on meteorological conditions. Vertical Farming Experiencing increasing popularity in urban areas & controlled- environment agriculture (CEA) worldwide. Concentrate on optimising agricultural output and minimising resource consumption. Metropolitan areas have pilot initiatives. The broader implementation is hindered by the substantial initial expenditure and the high energy expenses. There is a need to solve issues related to energy costs, restricted crop suitability, and scalability concerns. Precision Agriculture (Sensors & Data) Widely embraced in industrialised nations such as the United States, Europe, and Japan, with the purpose of enhancing resource utilisation. The primary emphasis is on variable rate technology (VRT) in relation to fertilisers and irrigation.
