 In general, Indian farmers in a variety of geographical settings are empowered by the integration of Al and loT in irrigation systems to make well-informed decisions, maximise water use, and sustainably enhance agricultural results, all of which support the nation's food security and economic growth. In India, the use of Al and loT-enabled irrigation systems can vary from small-scale installations on a single farm to extensive rollouts across whole agricultural districts. Using a local network or cloud-based platform, individual farmers, especially in southern India, may implement Al and loT technologies on a small scale to optimise water usage and increase agricultural yields on their fields. In western states, agricultural groups or cooperatives may put in place medium-sized irrigation systems with Al and loT capabilities that service several farms or areas of land. In order to gather data on crops, weather, and soil moisture, these implementations entail extending a network of Internet of Things (loT) sensors over a wider region. Data is then analysed using Al algorithms to forecast and optimise resource management and irrigation scheduling. Large-scale installations of Al- and loT-enabled irrigation systems across vast agricultural regions may be the result of government-led projects or collaborations with the private sector in states in central and northern India. These programmes seek to significantly increase agricultural output, modernise irrigation infrastructure, and improve water efficiency. In general, many criteria including the scale of the agricultural operation, the degree of technology adoption, and the accessibility of resources and infrastructure influence how Al and loT-enabled irrigation systems are used in India. These technologies have the power to completely change the way water resources are handled, resulting in more resilient and sustainable farming methods, whether applied to individual farms or to large agricultural landscapes.

Implementing AI and IoT-enabled irrigation systems in India comes with several lessons and challenges: ï‚· One of the primary challenges is ensuring widespread adoption of AI and IoT technologies among farmers, especially in rural areas. Limited awareness, access to technology, and technical expertise may hinder adoption rates. Providing training and support to farmers is essential to overcome this barrier.
