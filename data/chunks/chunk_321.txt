 However, there is an expectation that a renewed focus on millet production and value addition, both at the national and state levels, could reverse these trends in favour of millet cultivation.

(52,199 sq. m.) and location of Chhattisgarh is 17°46’ to 24°5’ North Latitude and from 80°15’ to 84°20’ East Longitude, with an average rainfall of around 1207 mm. Net sown area of the state is 46.51 lakh ha, which is 34% of its total geographical area (Source: website of Press Information Bureau). About 57% of the area has medium to light soil. Chhattisgarh has one of the richest bio diverse areas in the country with around 63.4 lakh ha area under forest cover, which is 46% of its total geographical area. The climate and topography in the northern and southern part of Chhattisgarh is conducive for millets cultivation. According to the Department of Agriculture, Government of Chhattisgarh, millets are grown across 1.41 lakh hectares of land (Table 3), accounting for 6% of the total cultivated area in the State. The major millet crops grown in Chhattisgarh are sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet and foxtail millet. Chhattisgarh ranks third in the country in sorghum and fourth in pearl millet cultivation. Despite being an important crop for the state, millet cultivation has been declining in recent years due to various challenges. However, recognizing the importance of millets for addressing malnutrition and climate change challenges, India has embarked on initiatives to revive their cultivation and consumption. The declaration of 2023 as the International Year of Millets by the United Nations has further propelled efforts to promote millets globally and within India. Challenges in millets cultivation in Chhattisgarh • Low productivity: Millet productivity in Chhattisgarh is notably lower when compared to staple crops like wheat and paddy. The primary reasons behind this disparity are the marginal lands with low fertility where millets are cultivated and their reliance on rain-fed conditions. Traditional farming practices, such as broadcasting seeds at the beginning of the monsoon and harvesting after 75-90 days, contribute to this Table 1.
