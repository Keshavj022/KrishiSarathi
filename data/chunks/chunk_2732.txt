 Gautam, the DOG (CS) at that time has denied knowledge of the same and has pointed out to the minutes of the 21-5-2008 meeting (which are signed by all participants of the meeting; Annexure-XI; Pgs.114-117) that this matter was not discussed in the meeting (letter of Dr. Gautam at 13 - - - - Annexure-XII; Pgs.118-124). As indicated above, Dr. Jain, the ADG (CC) at that time has indicated that he is unwell and does not recollect issues related to the meetings on BNBt (refer also paras 3.04 and 5.06). 7.06 Dr. Katageri says that he is a conventional breeder and did not have competence and facilities to discriminate MON531 and BNLA106 events. It is pertinent to note that, in the NATP proposal, Dr. Katageri is listed as the person responsible for molecular analysis of the transgenics. If he had no requisite expertise, he should have had the necessary corrections made in the project proposal, at some stage, or at least later have contacted Dr Kumar, P.I., or any other expert, for help and scientific guidance in the areas where he had no expertise. Dr. Katageri should have been more careful in the breeding process (please refer to para 5.08). 7.07 .Dr. Kranthi conducted analysis which gave him reason to suspect in 2005 and 2008 that samples given to him in fact had MON531. Although these were crucial observations, he did not give written reports to his seniors. He ventured to put his views down on paper in October 2009 only after it had become public knowledge that BNBt had been contaminated with MON531. Moreover, he signed and forwarded as Director, CICR, Nagpur, the application for registration of BNBt to PPV & FR Authority (the said application has been subsequently withdrawn). 7.08 Both Drs. Khadi and Katageri, being experienced cotton breeders, should have conducted selection for the event (BNLA106) by testing each generation for this event, particularly when another event (MON531) was in the field. However, they continued to select on the basis of protein expression (please refer to Para 5.04). 7.09 In all likelihood, the "contamination" (may be outcrossing or admixture) with MON5-31 occurred at UAS. This appears to have occurred not only before Dr. Katageri left for USA in October 2005, but even before Dr. Khadi moved to CICR in May 2005 as the seeds that Dr. Khadi took with him were already contaminated with MON531. Also, BNBt has been 'purified' (recently at UAS) using progeny of plants that were reported to be multicopy in the T4 generation (grown during 2005-06). Most of these progeny lines carried MON531 and very few (5 out of 135) had only BNBt. This is again consistent with the possibility that, by the T4 generation, BNBt had been contaminated with MON531. It is 14 - - - - - - - difficult to say whether contamination is deliberate or accidental. However, an accidental contamination would be difficult to explain as the T4 plants used for South.
