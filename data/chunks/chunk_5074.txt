3) and 14 during 26 November 2002 to 28 February 2003. The other treatments viz., cowdung slurry 2.5 kg with 1 litre and 2 litres water were also fairly effective in attracting the Oryctes rhinocerous beetles, i.e. 4 to 6 and 9 to 4 respectively during the periods mentioned above. Slurry pot placement in the field Cowdung in semi-solid form (with little liquid consistency) was effective in emanating the odour rather than when it was in watery form. However, castor (Ricineus communis L.) cake suspension Trapped beetles in cowdung slurry Trapped beetles in castor cake slurry 2.5 kg in 1 litre of water was found significantly superior in attracting the black beetle Oryctes  HORTICULTURAL CROPS rhinocerous than all other treatments. It was also observed that the beetles began to be attracted to mud pots only 7 days after initiation of experiments. Water was added for every 2 days once and new cowdung once every week, which led to emanations of strong odour from the mud pots. Similar trend of attracting more Oryctes rhinocerous beetle by cowdung slurry + fish powder was also noticed at Nanjegoundanpudur (18 beetles during 26 October 2002 to 28 February 2003 and 10 during 23 January 2003 to 28 February 2003), and Thensangampalayam (13 beetles during February 2003 alone). Castor cake suspension significantly attracted maximum number of beetles ranging from 13 to 27 in the above-mentioned two places. Cowdung slurry with 1 litre water combination is better than with 2 litre water in attracting the beetles. Based on the size and shape of wide mouthed mud pots. Capacity, it is felt that quantity of cowdung and castor cake 1 kg may be increased for effective attraction and strong odour emanating from the mud pots. CONCLUSION Castor cake 2.5 kg + 1 litre water kept in wide- mouthed mud pots (mouth width 24 cm × height 30 cm × bottom width 27 cm) attracted significantly maximum number of Oryctes rhinocerous beetles (up to 27). Among the cowdung-slurry treatments, cowdung-slurry 2.5 kg + 50 g dried fish powder in wide-mouthed mud pots also attracted more number of Oryctes rhinocerous beetles (up to 18), followed by other treatments of cowdung slurry with + litre of water (up to 15) and 2 litres water (up to 12). The other coconut pests viz. redpalm weevil, and black-headed caterpillar were not attracted to castor cake suspension and cowdung slurry. Since the castor cake suspension and cowdung slurry were plant and animal waste products, ecological safer and that too kept separately in mud pot traps, there won't be any adverse effect to the plant and soil in the coconut plantations. Thus the ITK was found to be good and effective, in controlling rhinocerous beetle in coconut.
