86 lakh farmers visit ATICs for obtaining solutions related to their agricultural problems and purchasing key farm inputs. The ICAR is continuously making efforts to develop innovative technologies not only for sustainable agriculture but also climate smart technologies for mitigation of effects of climate change on agriculture. I hope that the ICAR Annual Report 2021-22 will render help to all the stakeholders and for planning future strategies for agriculture research and education in the country.
