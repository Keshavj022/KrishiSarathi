 CRISPR/Cas technology was utilized to edit the cytokinin oxidase (OsCKX2) gene of indica rice cultivar rice controlling the grain number in order to increase the yield of Samba Mahsuri. The genome-edited T0 lines showed 200 to 496 grains/panicle in comparison to ~150 grains/panicle in wild-type or non-edited Samba Mahsuri plants while T1 lines showed desired characters like strong culm and early maturity. To create novel variants for morphological, physiological, and biotic stress tolerance traits, induced mutations were created in the background of Samba Mahsuri (BPT 5204). The mutant lines showing enhanced tolerance to important biotic stresses (YSB, ShB and BLB). Multiple abiotic stress responsive genes were identified using transcriptomics in sugarcane. A chromosome-level reference genome assembly (2.93 Gb; 97.66% Coverage) of Indian Tea (Camellia assamica var. Masters cv. TV-1) genome was generated anchoring 99.4% of super-scaffold level assembly into 15 clusters or pseudomolecules by Hi-C data with the size of clusters ranging from 303.18 Mb to 119.95 Mb. A novel abiotic stress responsive gene LOC_ Os06g10210 (OsCHI2) isolated from a drought tolerant rice cv. Nagina 22 (N22) which showed upregulation in response to drought stress was identified. miR156 site in Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1) gene in rice variety, Swarna, was edited. Panicle architecture and spikelets/ panicle improved significantly in edited lines. Presence of Protein Body 1 and 2 under different post-harvest processing conditions of grains of high protein rice CR Dhan 310 was identified. In order to identify the high resistant starch rice, 100 rice lines were analyzed which revealed variation in the range of 0.28% to 2.94% with Gayatri rice line showed the highest resistant starch content of 2.94% over the years (2019 to 2022). To screen large number of genotypes for vivipary, laboratory method was proved efficient considering the correlation with field observation data, outstanding genotypic difference and convenience of testing. Mutants of BPT 5204 with robust root system architecture, early seedling vigour index, and higher yield under limiting water conditions identified which are suitable for the dry direct seeding under aerobic system of rice cultivation. Genomes of rice restorer line KMR 3 (salinity-sensitive) and its salinity tolerant introgression line IL50-13 were sequenced. Draft genome of yellow stem borer Scirpophaga incertulas an agriculturally important pest with 46,057 genes and estimated size of 308 Mb was generated. During 2021-22, breeder seed production in field crops was 1,01,617.5 quintals against the indent of 77,260.1 quintals and total production of quality seed was 3,49,596.6 quintals against the target of 3,12,584.7 quintals. In addition, 234.5 lakh planting material and 5.4 lakh tissue culture plantlets were produced against the targets of 174.3 and 4.7 lakh, respectively.
