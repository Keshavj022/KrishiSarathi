80 kg respectively after six months of culture period. Stock enhancement in canals may be one of the noble options for sustainable fish production as well as support of the livelihood of rural poor fishers in Sundarbans. Attention has to be given to this pre-existing habitat to save water needed for farming and conservation of sustainable fish production.

In Myanmar, the rearing of snakeheads and climbing perch in irrigation channels is practicing by Chan myaung (irrigation canal, locally known as) owners in World scenario on canal fisheries Literatures revealed that various countries are producing fish from irrigations canals. It is estimated that almost 16% of the freshwater fishery production comes from Nile and its irrigation canals in Egypt. while in Sudan, the fish biomass in minor canals of Geizira irrigation system is on an average 660 kg/ha/year. The practice of simple release of species Oreochromis spp., Channa striata and Puntius gonionotus into irrigation canals resulted in reproduction of 350 kg/ha/year without supplementary feeding in Thailand. It is reported that channelization or irrigation canals exhibit lower species diversity than nearby static water bodies which is influenced by temperature and low primary producers. Fish biomass is 31% lower compared to an unchannelized stream and that reduced 78% in macro-invertebrate biomass. In Thailand, extensive culture of bighead carp, grass carp Table 1.

Canal resources in Sundarbans Indian Sundarbans, an important mangrove chunk in the world and an extremely fragile ecosystem inhabits considerable amount of threatened and vulnerable fish species. An area of 4,200 sq km of reserve forest located in India is a tide dominated low lying coastal wetland. The area experiences annual rainfall between 1,600-1,800 mm and severe cyclonic storms. The biodiversity of Sundarbans includes numerous species of phytoplankton, zooplankton, micro-organisms, benthic invertebrates, mollusks, amphibians and mammals. It has been inscribed as a World heritage site by International Union for Conservation and Nature (1987) and included as Biosphere Reserved under United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Man and the Biosphere (MAB) programme list (2001). Recently, in February 2019, the Indian Sundarbans have also been designated as ‘Wetland of International Importance’.
