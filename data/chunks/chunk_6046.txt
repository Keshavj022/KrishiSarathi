 The fruit is used in chronic diarrhoea and dysentery, and is said to act as a tonic for heart and brain. In the after-treatment of bacillary dysentery, the fruit is a useful adjuvant as it helps remove constipation which hinders the healing of ulcerated surfaces of intestines. Clinical trials of unripe fruits showed anti-viral activity against Ranikhat disease virus, hypoglycaemic activity and significant results against intestinal parasites, viz. Ascaris lumbricoides Linn, and Entamoeba histolytica. Besides the fruits, the roots, bark, leaf and seed of bael are valued in the indigenous system of medicine. The root is an ingredient of the dasamula (ten roots), a medicine commonly used by the Ayurvedic practitioners. The roots as well as the bark are used in the form of a decoction as a remedy in melancholia, intermittent fevers and palpitation of the heart. The young leaves and shoots are used as fodder for cattle, sheep and goats.
