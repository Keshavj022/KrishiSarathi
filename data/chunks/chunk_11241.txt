 Phosphorus-containing fertilizers like single super phosphate, dye ammonium phosphate should be used for the maximum yield of pigeon pea. Single Super Phosphate per ha. 250 kg or 100 kg Dye ammonium phosphate and 20 kg. Sulphur should be given at the time of sowing in rows. It would be appropriate that the entire amount of phosphorus be given from single super phosphate so that 12 percent sulphur can also be supplied. A small quantity of urea fertilizer (15-20 kg/ha) should be given only in those fields which are weak in the nitrogen content. yy To control broad leaf and narrow weeds use imazethapyr @ 100 g/ ha. For control of narrow weed quizalofop @50 g/ha can be used in Arhar. Green gram and Black gram Green gram varieties: Narendra Mung-1, Narendra Mung-2, T- 44, K -851, Sweta and Swati Black gram Varieties: Vallabh Urd -1, Narendra Urd-1, Narendra Urd-2, T-27, T-77, T- 65, T-9, Shekhar-1, Azad Urd-1, Shekhar-2, Azad Urd-2, Shekhar-3, Azad Urd-3 and KU-99-21 Land Preparation yy One deep ploughing followed by 2-3 harrowing s and planking are considered the optimum for mung bean cultivation. yy Field should be well levelled and completely free from weeds. yy More uptake of nitrogen and increased protein content was possible in wider spacing. Time of Sowing yy Mung bean and Urd bean is generally sown with the onset of monsoon from June to July. Both early and late plantings have adverse effects on the performance of mung bean. yy In early sowings crop suffers due to rains at maturity and late sown crop suffered due to poor growth and diseases infestation. 80 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS Nutrient management: yy Application of 20 kg N and 80 Kg P2O5 is advisable Water management: yy Rainy season mung and urd bean does not require irrigation unless there is a prolonged drought. Weed management: Application of pendimethalin 750 g/ha/ Oxadiazon 500 g/ha as pre-emergence for controlling many annual and broad leaf weeds. Imazethapyr 100 g/ha/ imazethapyr 14 g/ha + imazemox 14 g/ha/ imazethapyr 50g/ha + pendimethalin 750g/ha, sodium acifluorfen 165 g/ha + clodinafop-propargyl 80 g/ha, chlorimuron 6 g/ha, fenoxaprop 80 g/ha and quizalofop 40g/ha, as post-emergence is most effective to control grassy as well as broad-leaved weeds in soybean. This technology increases the grain production, improves quality of grain, and results higher income. Groundnut yy Grow improved varieties Chitra, Kaushal, Prakash, Ambar, TG-37a, Utkarsh and Divya according to the availability of growing period and purpose yy It is ready in about 120-130 days. It should be sown in the first fortnight of July so that the crop can be ready by the end of October. yy According to the species and season, the number of seeds and distance of 2 lines should be 45-50 cm and the distance between 2 plants should be 15-20 cm. Use 70-75 kg seed kernels/ha for all varieties. In late sown conditions, Use 90-95 kg seed kernels/ha.
