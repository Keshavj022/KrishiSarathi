Significant reduction in SCC was observed 10 days after treatment, with the application of bathua leaves paste on the mastitic udder. treatments. The results are presented in Table 1, which indicate that use of bathua leaves is less effective than homoeopathic and allopathic treatments in controlling swelling and time taken to recover. Experiment In phase I, the CMT point score, SCC and bacterial isolation in response to C. album treatment in lactating cows are presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4. Significant reduction in CMT point scores was observed 10 days after treatment. Significant reduction in SCC was observed 10 days post- treatment, with the application of bathua leaves paste on the mastitic udder. CONCLUSION It was concluded that the bathua-leaf paste (ITK) is not effective singly in clinical mastitis, but can be given as on adjunct therapy along with vitamin C and E. The application of Chenopodium paste reduces the swelling and pain in the inflamed udder. It also cured blood in milk, indicating its anti-inflammatory potential. Further studies for immunomodulatory potential and active ingredient identification or analysis are required to confirm the findings.
