 Eastern Himalayas Land resource inventory (LRI): National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS&LUP) is preparing Land Resource Inventory (LRI) of different blocks in the country on 1:10,000 scale to workout block level agricultural land use plan. The soil maps of East Siang district, Arunachal Pradesh, and Dhalai district, Tripura at 1:10,000 scale were prepared. Runoff, soil losses and erosion potential of farming systems: A simulation study was carried out for estimation of soil losses across 24 years old (1983–2006) well established eight micro-watersheds (MW) at ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Umiam, Meghalaya. The eight MWs had different farming systems (FS) based on livestock (W1), forestry (W2), agroforestry (W3), agriculture (W4), agri-horti-silviculture (W5), horticulture (W6), natural fallow (W7) and jhum (as control, W8). Among the eight combinations of FS, horticulture based system was most resilient against erosion evident from lowest annual soil losses (LPA: 9.36 t/ha) while traditional jhuming (with sparse broom grasses) practices encouraged the soil losses and recorded the highest LPA soil losses (17.62 t/ha). Integrated farming system model on sloppy land of NEH region: Under IFS, 1 ha land was optimized for different components—7,000 m2 area to agri/vegetable based cropping system; 2,000 m2 horticulture; and 500 m2 water harvesting pond in which fish was cultured. Livestock sector was utilized under 500 m2 area where vermi-composting unit, threshing floor and miscellaneous uses were accommodated. The economics of various components of IFS was worked out separately. Analysis revealed that the maximum net income of ` 126,557 was obtained only from cropping system followed by ` 20,481 from livestock component. Horticulture system recorded the maximum B:C ratio with a value of 2.25 followed by cropping component (2.05). The minimum B:C ratio (1.12) was registered from livestock component. As a whole, the IFS gave a net return of ` 169,794/ha annually after deducting total cost of production/rearing of ` 315,557. Total dry matter production amounting to 8.54 tonnes was generated from the system. Out of which, 6.94 tonnes was produced from the field crops and 1.50 tonnes from livestock unit. Horticulture unit produced 106.4 kg dry biomass for income. The other dry biomass produced from maize stalk, toria, ginger and turmeric along with livestock excreta and farm waste materials was used to make compost. Overall, 5.73 tonnes dry matter was used for composting and vermi-composting. Agri-horti-silvi-pastoral system for jhum cultivated area: Agri-horti-silvi-pastoral system was developed in 1.58 ha area as an initiative for jhum improvement programme. Nearly 0.55 ha was under forest while 1.03 ha under planned land use. The system was standardized in 0.80 ha area. In this system, 0.10 ha of the foothills was used for agricultural use, 0.25 ha for horticultural and 0.44 ha for silvi-pastoral crops, respectively.
