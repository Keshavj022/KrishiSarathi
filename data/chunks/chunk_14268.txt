 The Dakshin Dinajpur district’s economy is primarily based on the pri­ mary economic sector, more precisely on agriculture. According to census (2011) data, a total of 170,682 cultivators engage in agriculture cultivation, with 156,797 males and 13,885 women; and 174,690 in­ dividuals working as labourers on agricultural land, with 129,402 men and 45,288 women. Paddy, wheat, barley, and maize are the most widely farmed food grains. Agriculture’s development is critical to the socio-economic development of the study area. Agriculture develop­ ment has a huge impact on people’s socioeconomic conditions, and it is critical to building optimal agriculture practices to enable people to self-sustain (Pramanik, 2016). Population pressure on agricultural land and strong demand (Cowie et al., 2018) for foods necessitate speedy production or high-yield agriculture. Due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, insufficient irrigation infrastructure, insufficient transportation systems, depleted soil fertility, soil erosion, and other factors, agricultural production has fallen quickly (De la Rosa and Sobral, 2008). Land suitability analysis (LSA) is a method of figuring out how well land can be used for a certain purpose (Mistri and Sengupta., 2020). The * Corresponding author.

Land is a unique and significant element on the earth’s surface (Rossiter, 1996), and every living entity interacts with it directly or indirectly. Potential Suitability Assessment of Land (PSAL) determines the land’s suitability for a specified use (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009; Hayashi, 2000). The basic purpose of “PSAL” is to ascertain people’s satisfaction with a particular land use form (Hopkins, 1977), and it can assist policymakers in developing strategies to increase agricultural productivity by identi­ fying potentially suitable land for cultivation (FAO, 1976; Malczewski, 2004). MCDM approaches are commonly used to estimate the potential and inherent properties of soil (Mendas and Delali, 2012) and to determine the optimal Zones for cultivation (Steiner et al., 2000). Mosadeghi et al. (2015) say that MCDM uses a lot of variables to predict how land will be used in the future. The integration of remote sensing, GIS, and MCDM methodologies will always be promising for identifying new suitable places (Halder et al., 2020).
