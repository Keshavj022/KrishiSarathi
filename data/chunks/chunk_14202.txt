 This pattern persists through January 2018, while ESSMI does not show significant drought condi- tions until January 2018, with more pronounced signs in February and March 2018 (highlighted by the red dashed box). In the second instance (Fig. 8b), covering November 2006 to April 2007, SPI and SPEI show two periods of drought onset, in December 2006 and again in March 2007 (highlighted by the two purple dashed boxes). Conversely, SSMI begins to reflect drought conditions starting from January 2007, with continued manifestation into April 2007 (highlighted by the red dashed box). There is a gap between the two periods of meteorological drought indicated by SPI/SPEI (December 2006 âˆ’January 2007 and March 2007). Despite this gap, the agricultural drought signal, as captured by SSMI, aligns more continuously from January 2007 onward. This sug- gests that the SM response to meteorological drought may aggregate the impacts over time, leading to a sustained period of agricultural drought even if there are intermittent breaks in meteorological drought conditions. The land surface processes and human activities on drought propa- gation can also influence these observed delays. For instance, irrigation Fig. 8.

Palagiri and M. Pal International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation 134 (2024) 104175 7 practices can significantly alter SM dynamics and mitigate the impact of meteorological drought on agricultural activities. The irrigation can notably weaken the correlation between agricultural and meteorological droughts, reducing the propagation time of drought impacts (Gu et al., 2002; Chen and Hu, 2004). In our study, the delay observed in SSMI and ESSMI responses can be partially attributed to irrigation. Croplands, which are the most affected land cover (Fig. 13), demonstrate evidence of irrigation in the study area. During periods of meteorological drought, regions with active irrigation may not exhibit immediate signs of agri- cultural drought due to supplemental water from irrigation. This effect is evident in Fig. 8b and 8c, where agricultural drought indices lag behind meteorological drought indices by one to two months. This lag corre- sponds with the time required for irrigation to replenish SM deficits and sustain crop growth. Furthermore, groundwater levels play a critical role in drought dynamics. Regions with higher groundwater availability can draw water through soil capillary forces, maintaining SM levels even during meteorological droughts (Fawen et al., 2023). This is particularly important in areas where groundwater management is effective, as it can prolong the onset of agricultural drought despite ongoing meteo- rological drought conditions (Pei and Cui, 2013). For example, in Fig.
