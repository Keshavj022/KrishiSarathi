 Sensors attached to storage containers and trans- portation vehicles monitor factors like temperature and humidity, ensuring product quality and reducing postharvest losses [16]. 3.1.7. Automated Farming Equipment. IoT integration in agricultural machinery, such as tractors and harvesters, allows for autonomous operations. These smart machines can follow predeﬁned routes, adjust their actions based on real-time data, and optimize fuel consumption and productivity. The incorporation of IoT technology into agriculture is reshaping conventional farming into a sector driven by data, effectiveness, and sustainability. Through the utilization of real-time data, automation, and predictive analysis, farmers can render informed choices, enhance the allocation of resources, and elevate crop yields. The potential applications of IoT in agriculture have the capacity to revolutionize the industry, guaranteeing food security, and environmental stewardship for a rapidly growing global population [17]. 3.2. Data Analytics and AI for Smart Sensor Data Processing. Data analytics and AI play pivotal roles in the efﬁcient pro- cessing and utilization of smart sensor data. Smart sensors are devices equipped with advanced capabilities to gather and transmit data from the physical world. Data analytics is the process of examining, cleansing, transforming, and interpreting raw data to extract valuable insights and pat- terns. In the context of smart sensor data processing, data analytics is essential to make sense of the vast amounts of data generated by these sensors. By applying various statistical and machine learning techniques, data analytics can identify trends, anomalies, and correlations in sensor data, allowing businesses and entities to base their decisions on data and streamline processes [18]. AI complements data analytics by providing advanced algorithms and models that can auto- matically learn from data, adapt, and improve over time. AI techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, can be employed to generate predictive models aimed at antici- pating future occurrences, anomaly detection for identifying unusual behavior in sensor data, and classiﬁcation algorithms for categorizing data into different classes or clusters. The synergy between data analytics and AI allows smart sensor data to be transformed into actionable insights and valuable information. Here is how the process typically works: 1. Data collection: Smart sensors continuously collect data from the environment they are deployed. These data can include temperature, humidity, pressure, motion, sound, or any other relevant parameters depending on the sensor’s purpose. 2. Data preprocessing: The initial data acquired from sen- sors frequently includes disturbances, absent data points, or exceptional values. Data preprocessing encompasses reﬁning and converting the data into a proper format suitable for analysis.
