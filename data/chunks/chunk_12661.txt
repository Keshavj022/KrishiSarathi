5 lakh tonnes of mushroom are produced in the state, which can be very easily increased to 1 lakh tonnes. It will generate additional income in agriculture sector by Rs 141.7 crore. The economics of mushroom cultivation of a mushroom grower Mr. Yashpal Singh of Pathankot District is given below. Mushrooms were grown under two situations: 1 kanal shed with semi- automatic AC unit and 1 kanal area with temporary shed. The farmer earned a profit of Rs 2,95,000/- from mushroom production.

About 61 per cent area of Rajasthan is arid, 16 per cent semi-arid, 8 per cent sub-humid and 15 per cent humid. The importance of agriculture in the socio-economic fabric of Rajasthan can be realised from the fact that the livelihood of majority of the State’s population depends on agriculture. The agriculture sector contributes only about 26.5 per cent of the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with 65 per cent population dependence, resulting in low per capita income in the farm sector. Consequently, there is a large disparity between per capita income in the farm sector and the non-farm sector. Therefore, it is essential to deal with those issues and activities which impact the income levels of farmers. The income levels are determined by the overall production, supported by reasonable levels of yield and prices realised by the farmers. Several constraints, such as preponderance of small and marginal holdings accounting for about 82 per cent of total holdings, imperfect market conditions and lack of backward and forward linkages affect the income levels of fanners adversely.

Rajasthan was divided into nine Agro-climatic Zones (ACZs) under the National Agriculture Research Project (NARP)(1981-1993) for the purpose of micro- level planning.
