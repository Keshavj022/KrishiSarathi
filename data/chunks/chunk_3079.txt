1% over farmer’s practice(without Zn) during kharif and summer seasons respectively. At Samastipur (Bihar) in rice‐wheat crop sequence, sub‐optimal plant population was the major constraint in both rice and wheat and therefore by maintaining the proper plant population of rice (15x15 cm2) and wheat (23 cm apart) enhanced the yield upto 44.2 and 20.01% respectively over farmer’s practice. • Application of recommended dose of NPK (100:60:40) in rice and wheat recorded improvement in the yield upto 91.5 and 79.9% respectively over farmer’s practice (imbalance use of fertilizer) at Ambikapur (Chhatisgarh). Sub‐optimal plant population and weed infestation were the major productivity constraints at Ambala(Haryana). Weed control measures i.e. application of butachlor @ 3 1/ha in rice and leader @32.5 g/ha in wheat resulted in 7.4% higher yield advantage in rice and wheat respectively over farmers practice. Application of carbofuran 3 g during both the seasons resulted an increase of 9.42 and 3.56% in maize yield over farmer’s practices. Sub‐optimal‐plant population deteriorated yields level of maize‐wheat system considerably at Samastipur(Bihar). Maintaining 60x20 cm2 spacing in maize and 23 cm row spacing in wheat recorded 27.0 and 29.9% increase in yield of respective crops over farmer’s practices. • At Lohardaga (Jharkhand), use of improper variety was identified as the major constraints to limit the productivity of maize‐wheat system. Application of 100:50:40 kg NPK in maize (50% through FYM) and 10:50:30 kg NPK n wheat resulted in higher yields to the tune of 34.2 and 20.9 percent respectively over farmer’s practice at Chhindwara (MP). At Sirohi (Rajasthan), sowing of improved varieties i.e. PEHM‐2 (maize) and Raj. 1482 (wheat) with 60:30:30 and 90:35:30 kg NPK/ha respectively enhanced the yields up to level of 34.2 and 20.9 percent respectively over farmer’s practice. Chemical weed control through application of Lasso and isoproturon enhanced the crop yields upto 31 and 22.8% over farmer’s practice at Morena (M.P.) Maintaining 60x30 cm2 spacing in system and 20 cm row apart in wheat increased yield to the tune of 25 and 6.43% over farmer’s practice. However, weed control through applying Triflame @ 2/ha in soybean and 2,4‐D @ 2.5 1/ha +isoproturon @ 0.75 1/ha (mixed) in wheat increased yield to the tune of 29.9 and 24.6% respectively over farmer’s practice. www.icar.org.in 31 2002‐2007 2004‐2005 Long term studies on the relative efficiency of Legume rotations over cereal‐cereal rotations: • The change in soil properties, weed flora, soil fertility, additions and crop removal of NPK with special reference to nitrogen budgeting as influenced by various rotations are recorded at Raipur, Durgapura and Kota. The incorporation of legumes in cropping sequence resulted in built up of available pool of average N and P content and it synchronized with the level of its fertilizer application.
