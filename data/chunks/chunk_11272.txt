 yy Recommended varieties for Rainfed upland paddy: Fazu-MZ UPR 4, Maibasa- MZ UPR 25, Bhadepui- MZ UPR 23, Biroin- MZ UPR 24, Sazukthau- MZ UPR 6, Lalron- MZ 28, Idaw- MZ UPR 11, Buhban- MZ UPR 2, MZ UPR 33. Upland Rice yy Seed treatment of direct seeded upland rice with carbendazim &2- 3g/kg of seed. yy Dibbling should be done for assured germination yy 1st weeding for upland paddy should be done from Mid-May. yy 2nd weeding should be done from 1st week of June to 2nd week of July. yy Log wood/bamboo bunding across the slope and recharge pit digging (1x1x1ft) at steep slope of jhum fields with a slope percent of more than 30 % may be made to avoid severe erosion. Lowland Rice yy Nursery raising should be done by 2nd week of June in raised bed. The soil should be finely tilt with application of FYM @ 2 t / ha. yy Preparation of main field for transplanting Rice seedlings may be started from 1st week of June and puddling to be started with the onset of monsoon. yy SRI method of rice cultivation can be advocated for higher yield in small areas. 138 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy Transplanting of Rice should be completed by 3rd week of July depending upon the varieties. yy Root dip treatment with SSP/ Rock phosphate + Microbial consortium should be done overnight with uprooted rice seedlings prior to transplanting of rice. yy For organic control of insect pests, apply Neem based Biopesticides, Trichogramma and Yellow sticky trap, etc. Biocontrol agents like spiders, dragon flies and damsel fly, coccinellids should be conserved. yy Seed priming can be done with Zinc sulphate, 1000 sq. m nursery area for planting one hectare of land is sufficient yy Well decomposed FYM should be applied 2-3 days before sowing @ 10 q/1000 sq. m yy In addition, Azospirillum may be applied @ 2 kg/1000 sq. m area. yy Seed rate @ 3.5-4 kg for 100 sq. m of sea is sufficient for one hectare transplanting area. yy Seed bed should be covered with thin layer of soil or compost immediately after sowing. yy Uprooting of 25-30 days old rice seedlings with 20 cm x 15 cm spacing and 2-3 seedlings/ hill is considered best for timely transplanted crop. yy Seed rate should be maintained&@ 35-40kg/ha for Integrated Crop management (ICM) and 3-5kg/ha for SRI methods. yy Spacingshouldbemaintainedby20cmx 20cminICMand25cmx25cm for SRI methods. yy Cono weeder can be used for weeding purpose. Maize yy Farmers are advised to create drainage channel around the field especially low laying areas to drain out excess water. yy Recommended varieties for Composites: RCM- 75, RCM-1-1, RCM 1-76, RCM 1-3, Vivek Sankul. yy Recommended varieties for Hybrid: Vivek QPM-9, HQPM-1. 139 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy Local varieties: Mimban, Mimpui. yy Land preparation can be done by giving at least 3 deep ploughing followed by sowing of maize seed @ 20 â€“ 22 kg/ha at a spacing of 60cm X 20cm. yy Installation of Pheromone traps @ 12 traps/ha. in 3rd to 4th week of May.
