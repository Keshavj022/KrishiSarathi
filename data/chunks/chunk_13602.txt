Notes: A kernel matching procedure matches farmers across treatment and control groups. We use an epanechnikov kernel function and the bandwidth parameter equals 0.06. We deﬁne a common support region by dropping those treated farmers whose propensity score is higher than the maximum or less than the minimum of control farmers and vice versa. CBPs = Capacity-building programs on the varietal evaluation of wheat. 28 After matching, none of the farmers in the treatment or control group appears to be in the ‘‘out of common” support region. Therefore, with and without matching, the number of treatment and control farmers are same (146 treatment and 813 control). 29 After matching, six farmers in the treatment group appear to be in the ‘‘out of common” support region. With matching, the number of treatment and control farmers is 182 and 573, respectively. Without matching, the number of treatment and control farmers is 188 and 573, respectively. 30 MDID estimates are based on Equation (1). D. Varshney, P.K. Joshi, A. Kumar et al.

The identiﬁcation assumption also will not hold if the program placement is correlated with the initiation of another new agricultural extension program or the expansion of an existing one. For robustness, we include a time-varying control at the district level: the percentage of farmers who received exten- sion services from other government programs.31 Column 2 pre- sents the results, which show a pattern similar to that of Column 1. Column 3 shows the results of falsiﬁcation tests (whether pre- intervention trends exist across primary or secondary beneﬁciaries and non-beneﬁciaries).32 To do this, we estimate equation (1) using 2014–15 and 2015–16 data. The coefﬁcient a3 is insigniﬁcant, sug- gesting a similar trend across primary or secondary beneﬁciaries and non-beneﬁciaries in the absence of frontline demonstration interventions. The results indicate that inappropriate identiﬁcation assumptions do not drive the matched difference-in-differences estimate. Table 6 presents the impact estimates for the adoption of HD- 2967 by farmers who received capacity-building program beneﬁts from KVK staff (Columns 1 and 2).33 In Column 1, the coefﬁcient a1 shows a 21 % increase in adoption of HD-2967 between 2015–16 and 2017–18. The estimated coefﬁcient a2 reveals that the difference in adoption of HD-2967 was insigniﬁcant between primary beneﬁcia- ries and non-beneﬁciaries in 2015–16.
