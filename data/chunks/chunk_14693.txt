 Previous studies have also demonstrated the application of computer vision algorithms on high-resolution imagery and aerial photography [46]. Some research has underscored the significance of texture in the mapping of solar power plants [47]. Numerous studies leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting solar panels, incorporating advanced models like Faster-RCNN, a ResNet-50 classifier [48], while others employ the EfficientNet-B7 classifier [49] or the YOLO v5 algorithm [50]. The primary sources of images are aerial datasets and satellite images, obtained through the Google Map Static API [48,49]. Some images exhibit lower resolution due to the incorporation of thermal bands [51]. Various limitations exist, such as hardware restrictions limiting the mini-batch size for online training to a single image, potentially impacting the learning trajectory and the overall efficacy of the method [48]. If lens distortions in thermal images are not corrected, it could negatively impact the accuracy of solar panel detection [51]. Additional challenges arise due to memory constraints and the associated costs of GPU instances [49]. In certain instances, the dependency on local descriptors is significant, and inaccuracies therein can result in substantial detection Fig. 2. Dynamic relationship between Solar-Agri-Water nexus. H. Supe et al. Heliyon 10 (2024) e23125 4 errors [50]. This study introduces a detection algorithm applicable to openly available optical satellite data, which can be utilized for solar capacity generation estimation. The integration of this detection index algorithm with satellite data enables real-time monitoring of solar power expansion in a straightforward manner. This research underscores the utilization of SPI in pinpointing power plant loÂ­ cations and conducting environmental impact analyses on a national scale. The Google Earth Engine platform has significantly streamlined workflow processing. Previous studies have evaluated potential solar power generation in India [52], leveraging the proficiency of remote sensing and GIS technologies [53]. This study continues to harness these powerful tools in the monitoring of solar power. Remote sensing can also support evidence-based decision-making in resource management, which is crucial for addressing the complex challenges of the water-energy-food nexus [54]. This research employs optical satellite data from the Sentinel-2 mission and Landsat to study the growth of solar power generation and its interaction with various environmental factors. Additionally, various Geographic Information System (GIS) datasets were utilized for assessment and map generation purposes. Our analysis focused on a ten-year period, observing changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) within the Pavagadh solar park in India. This investigation shed light on alterations in irrigation practices and the management of water resources within the region.
