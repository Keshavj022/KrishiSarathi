Sustainability 2022, 14, 16861 10 of 18 One-Way Fixed Effect Model—Time Effect Model This section presents the time (year-wise) ﬁxed-effect model in Tables 5 and 6. In this model setup, most of the predictor variables are found to be statistically insigniﬁcant. Also, the demand side factor such as urbanization is found to impact negatively the crop diversiﬁcation process. Before commenting on this, we must check for other options of panel data estimation and select the most suitable form of panel data for this data set. Table 5.

Random Effect Model One side effect of the ﬁxed-effects models is that they cannot be used to investigate time-invariant causes of dependent variables. Technically, time-invariant characteristics of individuals are perfectly collinear with the cross-sectional-entity (states of the country in this case) dummies. Therefore, unlike the ﬁxed-effects model, the random- effect model assumes that the variation across entities to be random and uncorrelated with the predictor or independent variables included in the model.
