 Ten indicators were identified for agriculture, and overall 20% weightage was allocated to agriculture for calculating ranking focusing on outputs (yield, price realization, etc.), inputs (quality seed distribution, soil health cards), and institutional support (crop insurance, electronic markets, artificial insemination, animal vaccination, etc.). The weightage for agriculture productivity was given only 1%. These districts were compared with the low agricultural productivity districts identified in this study to know how many of these districts are covered under aspirational districts programs. A state-wise comparison of these districts is presented. Results show that out of 122 districts, only 28 were covered under aspirational districts. Though only 1% weightage was given to agricultural productivity in the score developed for identifying aspiration districts (most backward districts) in India, about 25% of the total low agricultural productivity identified in the study was covered in the aspirational districts. It suggests that agricultural productivity is vital for achieving the countryâ€™s egalitarian objective of inclusive growth and sustainable growth and development. Growth in the agriculture sector is two to four times more effective in raising incomes among the poorest than other sectors (World Bank, Undated). Prioritizing low-food grain productivity districts Prioritizing low-food grain productivity districts is important for several reasons. First, it can improve food grain production, as low-food grain productivity districts are more likely to face food insecurity because the yield gap in these districts is at least 0.8t/ha. Second, these districts Table 1. State-wise low food grains productivity (<1.5 t/ha) districts State No.
