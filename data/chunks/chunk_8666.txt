Existing and expanding irrigation infrastructure has to be physically and financially sustained first. Surface irrigation infrastructure has deteriorated due to deferred maintenance. This has culminated in stagnating or falling irrigation coverage affecting agricultural growth in several regions. Area irrigated by major, medium and minor irrigation systems has been either stagnating or declining from mid 1980s or during 1990s. Declining Irrigation Infrastructure Declining Irrigation Infrastructure Declining Irrigation Infrastructure Declining Irrigation Infrastructure Declining Irrigation Infrastructure Currently canals in Uttar Pradesh are irrigating 3.06 million ha in the triennium ending (TE) 2000 as against 3.33 million ha in TE 1985. Similarly, in Andhra Pradesh, canals now irrigate 11% lesser area than what was irrigated 15 years back. Bihar, Orissa and Tamil Nadu also recorded similar decline in the canal irrigated area. On many irrigation commands, effective irrigated area has declined due to deterioration in the distribution infrastructure. Rapid depletion, salinization and pollution related problems threaten regions with sustainable groundwater balance, whose area is continuously shrinking. Administrative blocks categorized as ‘dark’ or critical increased @ 5.5% per annum during mid 1980s to mid 1990s. At this rate, 1/3rd of the blocks in the country would come under ‘grey’ category within two decades. Groundwater mining has resulted in fluoride contamination in north Gujarat and Rajasthan and arsenic contamination in southern West Bengal endangering the sustainable livelihood of the poor. In 1995, nearly 90% of the over exploited blocks were located in Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Rajasthan.
