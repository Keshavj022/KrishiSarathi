 It is based on four pillars, i.e. food availability, food access, food utilization and food stability. To increase Indian Farming 73 (06): 61-65; June 2023 food availability, the introduction of ACs to a region such as low-productivity area would target to enhance food availability in terms of high quantity, quality and nutritive values in that particular region. Given the nutritional importance of ACs for health point of view, these crops have been well known as climate resilient to cope up with biotic and abiotic stress under climate change scenario. ACs are apt due to their acclimatization potential to marginal environments and/or their tolerance to biotic (pests and diseases) or abiotic stress (heat, drought, salt stress, frost etc.). A list of potential ACs with nutritive values is listed in Table 1. Underutilized horticultural crops as alternate crops for nutritional security Horticultural crops, particularly, fruits and vegetables are not only the source of vitamins, minerals, fat, proteins, carbohydrates and dietary fibers, but eating them reduces the risk of diseases. Low intake of fruits and vegetables has been recognized as a top risk factor for global mortality by the World Health Organization. It is important to consume a variety of fruits, vegetables, spices, and condiments to derive the required nutrition because no single fruit or vegetable can nourish the body with all the vital ingredients. In India, the per capita consumption of fruits and vegetables is only about 120 and 250 g per day per person, which is less than the minimum dietary requirement of 200 and 300 g per day per person. This warrants the need for scaling up the horticultural production in the country. Several fruits with high nutrient density are super- Indian Farming 62 June 2023 Table 1.
