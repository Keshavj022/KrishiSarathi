 One gram panchayat (GP) was randomly selected from each income block using the lottery method of simple random sampling. After the selection of GPs, two revenue villages were chosen from each GP using a combination of judgmental sampling and a simple random sampling procedure. The process of choosing rev- enue villages involved gathering socioeconomic and demographic data at the village level from the 2011 census database. It has been noted that certain general practitioners have villages with a small number of families, some of which have less than 20. Thus, in this phase of the sampling procedure, a blend of judgmental sampling and simple random sampling was employed to ensure that the chosen village has a minimum of 30 households engaged in agricultural and related activities, either directly or indirectly. In addition, the distance between the village and the GP ofﬁce was considered when selecting settlements. One village was chosen in close proximity to the GP ofﬁce, and another community was located at a signiﬁcant distance from the GP ofﬁce. This factor was taken into ac- count, as it is believed that the village located closer to the GP ofﬁce (the ofﬁce responsible for managing and regulating various policy in- terventions and providing extension services to farmers) may receive the advantages of government policy interventions and extension services more effectively than a village located farther away from the GP ofﬁce (according to the Singer-Prebish hypothesis, which relates to the rela- tionship between the centre and the periphery). The current study encompassed a total of 34 villages, with two villages selected from each Table 1 Sampling process.
