 Technology Assessment, Demonstration and Capacity Development DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 108 Off-season vegetable production to improve the livelihood of Kullu farmers Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh, owing to its diverse agro-ecological situations, is endowed with comparative advantage for growing various off-season vegetables. As the apple cultivation/production shifted further to higher altitudes, off-season vegetables emerged as a suitable remunerative alternative for farmers. KVK, Kullu, initiated its programmes towards the diversification of agriculture through off-season vegetable cultivation. The total area under off-season vegetables in the district has increased from 301 ha in 1995-96 to 6,537 ha in 2016-17. The productivity (average) of the vegetables as a whole also increased to 188.5 q/ha in 2016-17; about 18-20 times more than 1995 - 96. Various vegetable cultivation technologies popularized by KVK, Kullu, have also spread to the adjoining district, Mandi, where large numbers of farmers have now started vegetable cultivation as a vocation for their income improvement. With the adoption of vegetable cultivation technologies (65-85 %), the net annual income of the farmers in the district now ranges from ` 1.5 lakh to ` 2.0 lakh from one acre of land. As there is a huge demand of fresh vegetables in the nearby big city markets, the farmers supply their vegetable produce directly to the number of market yards established by Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). The produce is transported to other cities and towns, where the demand is further high. TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, DEMONSTRATION AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 109 trials in the farmers’ fields under various thematic areas, viz. integrated crop management, integrated disease management, integrated nutrient management, integrated pest management, integrated weed management, resource conservation technologies and varietal evaluation. The major crops included are cereals, pulses, oilseeds, fruits and vegetables. Besides, 21 technological interventions in 28 locations were also refined through 56 trials on livestock, poultry and fisheries enterprises under the thematic areas, viz. disease management, evaluation of breeds, feed and fodder management and nutrition management. In addition, one women specific technology was also refined by conducting 10 trials in 3 locations under the thematic areas, viz. health and nutrition. Frontline demonstrations During the year, a total of 182,696 demonstrations covering an area of 66,203 ha were organized. Of these 71,910 (39%) demonstrations covering an area of 28,764 ha were on pulses; 39,514 (22%) demonstrations covering an area of 16,928 ha were on oilseeds and 50,579 (27%) demonstrations covering an area of 15,214 ha were on other crops (cereals, millets, commercial crops, fiber crops, spices, medicinal crops, plantation crops, fodder crops and horticultural crops, etc.).
