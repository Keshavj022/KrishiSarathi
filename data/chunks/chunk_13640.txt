Farming System 2 (2024) 100100 tillage, organic fertilizers, and integrated pest management under sus- tainable agricultural practices (SAPs), which are explained as following. i) Conservation tillage helps in soil conservation by reducing soil erosion and involves practicing no-till, ridge-till, and mulch-till (Janssen and Hill, 1994). Tillage, i.e., turning over 6–10 inches of soil before planting new crops, leads to lesser absorption of water and nutrients into the soil, resulting in disturbance of intricate soil structure. Thereby, following minimum tillage practices keeps the soil structure intact, leading to soil conservation by leaving crop residue on the soil surface (Spears, 2018). ii) Intercropping is the practice of sowing two or more two crops near, which may be two cover crops, cover and non-cash crops, or two cash crops. This cropping system helps in the efﬁcient utilization of resources, i.e., light, water, and nutrients, is resistant to pest attack, and leads to improvement in crop yield and income (Mohler and Johnson, 2009). iii) Crop rotation involves planting different crops on the same land in suc- cession, which helps in reducing weeds, pest attacks, and chemical fer- tilizers leading to the recovery of soil nutrients and improved soil health (Rodale Institute, 2020). iv) Use of organic products i.e., fertilizers, pes- ticides, compost, manure helps in enhancing the agro-ecosystem and soil biological health (TNAU, 2016). v) Integrated pest management minimizes risk to the environment and people by using biological control and modiﬁcation of cultural practices (Stenberg, 2017). Looking at the beneﬁts of SAPs, Indian government has launched various schemes and programs (National Mission for Sustainable agri- culture, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, Soil health card) for incen- tivizing and motivating farmers to adopt SAPs. However, despite the signiﬁcant advantages it offers for the environment, society, and health, the uptake of sustainable practices remains notably low among farmers, particularly within the agricultural community of the Indian subconti- nent (Mishra et al., 2018; Patle et al., 2020). Concerning this, current study aims to understand the factors that can motivate farmers in adopting SAPs.
