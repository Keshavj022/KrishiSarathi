 Genetic resources of Root and Tuber Crops • A total of 4350 accessions were being maintained at various centres apart from CTCRI. The centre at Dholi maintained the largest collection (1489 accessions) followed by Coimbatore, Jagdalpur, Kalyani and Rajendranagar. There were about 24 species of tuber crops in the collection. There was an increase of 286 accessions compared to 2002‐2003 where in a total of 4069accessions was reported. Maximum collections were in sweet potato followed by Colocasia, cassava, yam bean and yams. At Yethapur 363 accessions of cassava were maintained and evaluated. The evaluation of entries for starch content revealed that 67 accessions recorded more than 25 per cent starch content. • At Jorhat twelve accessions of greater yam were characterized and catalogued. 113 collections of Dioscorea were made from 30 blocks of Chattisgarh state including Bastar and Dandiwada districts. • At Kovvur, the germplasm of Colocasia was maintained in three groups viz., short duration (less than 6 months), medium duration (6 months to 7 months), long duration (7 months and above) and was evaluated for the various morphological characters and yield. Plant height, number of tillers, number of leaves, single plant yield in number as well as by weight and cormel yield per hectare of short, medium and long duration germplasm entries were recorded. A total of 92 germplasm was characterised and classified morphologically. Among the 28 short duration entries , CA 7, CA 18 and CA 44 had recorded the maximum cormel yield of 37.0 t ha‐1 . Among the 34 medium duration entries, CA 42 recorded maximum yield of 48.8 t ha‐1 followed by CA 57 (34.4 t ha‐1). Out of 30 long duration entries KCS 2 recorded maximum yield of 48.5 t ha‐1 followed by Panchamukhi (45.9 t ha‐1). • Among the elephant foot yam accessions maintained at Kovvur, 20 non‐irritant types and 12 irritant types were evaluated along with a local for their yield and other characters like plant height, pseudostem girth, leaf canopy spread, single tuber weight and yield per hectare. Among the non irritant types , AC‐ 25 recorded a maximum yield of 81.40 t ha‐1 followed by accession AC‐ 3 (80.48 t ha‐1), AC‐6 and AC‐26 (77.70 t ha‐1 each). Among the irritant types AC ‐ 36 had recorded maximum yield of 48.10 t ha‐1 followed by NDA‐ 4 (43.00 t ha‐1). www.icar.org.in 15 2002‐2007 3.2.B Recommended Production Technologies:Crop‐ wise Cassava • A spacing of 90x90cm and 100:50:100 kg ha‐1 of NPK gave maximum tuber yield in cassava at Navasari • Half the recommended dose of P2O5 with full dose N and K and FYM(12.5 t ha‐1 ) along with combined application AM Fungi and Phosphobacteria(10kg ha‐1) recorded 28.03 t ha‐1 cassava tuber and it was comparable to that of recommended dose of NPK and FYM both at Yethapur, Salem of Tamil Nadu and at Peddapuram of Andhra Pradesh.
