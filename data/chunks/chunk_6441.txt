1% (dip method) was observed effective. White grubs could be effectively managed by the soil application of Clothianidin 50 DWG @ 250 g/ha. Steinernemachola shanense, an entomopathogenic nematode was observed compatible with the recommended agrochemicals and can be readily combined and used under the field conditions for the management of potato tuber moth (Phthormea operculella). Results of four years crop rotation for the management of potato cyst nematodes (PCN) revealed that Oat-Oat-Mustard-Trap crop sequence resulted in highest reduction (61.4%) of PCN population followed by Potato-Rajmash-Trap-Rajmash (48.7%) crop sequence. Nematode management in elephant foot yam: Farmer participatory integrated plant parasitic nematodes management showed significant reduction in the nematode infestation in elephant foot yam. Soil application of Trichoderma harzianum (CPTD- 28) enriched neem cake (1:100) @ one kg/pit during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season significantly suppressed the build-up of root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita population and reduced yellowing of vines. Management of postharvest rot in elephant foot yam corms (culinary use): Treating the elephant foot yam corms in water containing turmeric powder or crushed garlic @10 g/l for 10 min, draining, shade drying and storing in a ventilated place was observed satisfactory for management of post-harvest rot. Identification of viruses in cucurbit vegetables: On the basis of sequence analysis of amplified product, two Crinivirus (Cucurbit chlorotic yellow virus - CCYV and Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus - CYSDV) and two Polerovirus (Cucurbit aphid-borne yellow virus - CABYV and Luffa aphid-borne yellow virus - LABYV) species were characterized. Phylogenetic analysis revealed less genetic distance among the Indian isolates of CCYV, CYSDV and LABYV, whereas CABYV closely related to China isolate. This study documents infection of CCYV on cucumber, round melon and muskmelon; CYSDV on satputia and sponge Control of postharvest rot in elephant foot yam corms CROP MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 88 gourd; CABYV on ivy gourd; and LABYV on ridge gourd, satputia and muskmelon for the first time in India. Integrated management of Ganoderma induced basal stem rot: In-vitro evaluation of new generation fungicides against Ganoderma lucidum revealed that Propiconazole 13.9% + Difenoconazole 13.9%, Fluopyram 17.7% w/w + Tebuconazole 17.7% w/w, Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% w/w WG, Hexaconazole 5% SC, Propiconazole 25% EC, Azoxystrobin 8.3% + Mancozeb 66.7% WDG and Copper Sulphate 47.15% + Mancozeb 30% WDG have 100% inhibition in mycelial growth at five different doses (250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 ppm) tested.
