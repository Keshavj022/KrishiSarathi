 A list of some of the promising small millet cultivars in India are given in Table 1. Indian Farming 73 (01): 61-63; January 2023 Table 1.

They can be grown in both tropical and sub-tropical regions. Millet has wide adaptability to different soil from very poor to very fertile and can tolerate a certain degree of alkalinity. The best soils for their cultivation are alluvial, loamy and sandy soil with good drainage. Land preparation Millets require fine tilth for crop establishment, initial root and shoot development. One ploughing followed by 2–3 harrowing and cross plantings is necessary to obtain fine tilth. Levelling of fields is necessary for adequate drainage. Indian Farming 62 January 2023 Optimum time of sowing Millets are grown in almost all the seasons of the year. The best time for sowing kharif crop is last week of June to first week of July depending on the onset of monsoon. Whereas rabi crop is sown in the month of October–November and summer crop in the month of January–February. In Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, these crops as grown as irrigated catch crop in the month of mid-March to mid-May. Seed rate and spacing Optimum seed rate and spacing ensures higher yield in millets. Seed rate depends on the method of sowing and seed size. The recommended seed rate to achieve the required plant population of ~4.0–5.0 lakh/ha for most of the millets is given in Table 2. The line to line distance at the time of sowing should be 20–30 cm and plant to plant distance should be 10–15 cm Table 2. Optimum seed rate for higher yield in small millets Crop Method of sowing Seed rate Finger millet Line sowing 5–6 kg/ha Transplanting 4 kg/ha Other small millets Line sowing 5–6 kg/ha Broadcasting 8–10 kg/ha Fertilizers/nutrient management Millets respond well to fertilizer application especially to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The recommended doses of fertilizers vary from state to state and with seasons. Judicious use of organic and inorganic manures enhances the fertilizer efficiency (Table 3). Entire P2O5 and K2O should be applied at sowing, whereas nitrogen should be applied in 2 or 3 split doses depending upon moisture availability.
