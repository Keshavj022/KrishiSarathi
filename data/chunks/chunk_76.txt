It is established fact that rural women plays vibrant role in Indian agriculture and economy but the irony with women farmer is, that the role played by them is always undervalued and the tag of 'helping hand' has not changed yet. The performance of women farmers is always appreciable and they can Cow dung pots making succeed in many avenues but they face lot of challenges like limited access to inputs (land, seed, fertilizers etc.), critical services (capacity building) and organized markets to prove their existence as compared to male counterparts. So there is an urgent need of strengthening and empowering the Indian rural women for holistic development of society and our country. *Corresponding author email: skumar710@gmail.
