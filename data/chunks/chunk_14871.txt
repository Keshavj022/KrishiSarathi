 Further, the collected soil samples were sieved via a 2 mm sieve, and the coarse particles that remained in the sieve were washed thoroughly with water and dried at 105 ◦C to obtain stone weight. The MWD of water- stable aggregates was determined by soil's aggregate size analysis using a Yoder apparatus as per the wet-sieving principle (Yoder, 1936). The mechanical sieve shaker consists of a nest of sieves of different mesh sizes, viz. 0–0.12 mm, 0.12–0.25 mm, 0.25–0.50 mm, 0.50–1 mm, 1–2 mm, 2–4 mm, and 4–8 mm. Air-dried soil samples (100 g), free from any foreign material, were processed across an 8 mm sieve and placed on the sieve shaker's topmost sieve (4 mm mesh size). Before beginning the wet-sieving process, the soil sample was slowly rewetted for 10 min, and then the nest of sieves was moved up and down with an amplitude of 3 cm and at a rate of 30 cycles minute−1 for 30 min inside the water drum (Zhou et al., 2020). The water-stable aggregates that remained on each sieve at the end of the process were collected and oven-dried at 60–80 ◦C unless a consistent weight was achieved. To assess the impact of land conversion from forest type to other agricultural practices on soil structure, the MWD of aggregates was determined using the following formula (Kemper and Rosenau, 1986). MWD (mm) = ∑ n i=1 (DiMi) ∑ n i=1 Mi (1) where Mi is the soil mass (g) retained in each aggregate class to total soil mass, and Di is the average diameter of the respective sieve (mm). The air-dried soil samples were then filtered through a 2 mm sieve to analyze SOC and TN in the laboratory. 2.4. Estimation procedure for soil quality parameters 2.4.1. Determination of concentration of SOC and TN The SOC was analysed by wet digestion via the Walkley and Black method, i.e., wet oxidation with chromate in the presence of strong acid (Walkley and Black, 1934). A factor of 1.32 is traditionally multiplied by the value obtained by the above method to compensate for SOC's partial oxidation and to obtain total SOC (Magdoff and Weil, 2004). However, the factor is not universally applicable for all soil types; hence we used a revised factor (1.818), as reported by Krishan et al. (2009) for our study area, to compensate for the partial oxidation of SOC and estimate the total SOC. The TN content was determined by the wet oxidation based on the Kjeldahl method (Bremner, 1965). 2.4.2. Calculation of stratification ratio As shown in Eq. (2), the stratification ratio (SR) of bulk density, MWD, SOC, and TN were computed by dividing the value of each soil parameter in the top (0–5 cm) soil layer by the values of the following deeper layers (5–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–25, and 25–30 cm) (Fran­ zluebbers, 2002a). SR = Value of soil parameter in the top (0 −5 cm) soil layer Value of soil parameter in the subsequent bottom soil layer (2) 2.4.3. Calculation of SOC and TN storage The equivalent soil mass (ESM) approach was used to compute SOC and TN storage (Ellert and Bettany, 1995; Xue et al.
