 harzianum @ 15 g per litre of water before transplanting. Seedlings of Basmati varieties are ready for transplanting when they attain 5 to 6 leaf stage or are 25-30 days old.   Irrigate the nursery before uprooting and wash them to remove mud. Transplant two seedlings per hill in lines at 20 x 15 cm (33 hills/sq. metre) during the optimum period in a well puddled field. In the late transplanted crop, the spacing may be reduced to 15x15 cm (44 hills/sq. metre) to minimize the reduction in yield.   Practice green manure before basmati. Do not apply urea if thefield has been green manured with 45-55 days old sunnhemp/dhaincha or summer moong straw has been incorporated after picking of pods.   Apply fertilizers on soil test and crop rotation basis.Skipphosphorus application if the recommended dose of phosphorus has been applied to the preceding wheat crop. Apply 45 kg/ ha urea for CSR 30, Basamti 386 and Basmati 370 where as apply 90 kg/ha urea for varieties like Punjab Basmati 5, 4, 3 & 2 and Pusa Basmati 1121, 1637 & 1718 and apply 135kg/ha for Pusa Basmati 1509. Apply urea in two equal splits at 3 weeks and 6 weeks after transplanting. If possible, apply urea when water is not standing in the field. Irrigate on third day of the application of urea.   Basmati 386 and Basmati 370 if transplanted too early in the season have a prolonged vegetative phase resulting into a tall and leafy crop. Such a crop is more prone to lodging because of excessive height and vegetative growth. To check lodging, lopping of the upper half of crop canopy (Basmati 386 and Basmati 370) after 45 days of transplanting may be done. Further it would also reduce stem borer damage.   Use 50 g per acre Takumi 20 WG (flubendiamide) for control of stem borers and leaf folder.   Use 80 g per acre Token 20 SG (dinotefuran) for control of planthoppers Cotton   To obtain higher yield, grow Bt cotton variety PAU Bt 3, PAU Bt 2, PAU Bt 1 and other Bt hybrids recommended by PAU, Ludhiana. List of recommended Bt cotton hybrids is published in leading new papers and publications of PAU. Among the non Bt hybrids/varieties, grow LHH 144, F 2228, F 2383, LH 2108 and LH 2076 and desi cotton varieties LD 1019, LD 949 and FDK 124.   Apply heavy pre-sowing irrigation preferably with canal water for good germination and early crop establishment. Ridge sowing of cotton saves substantial amount of water. In case of poor- quality irrigation water, apply pre-sowing irrigation with canal water and subsequently with poor quality tube well water in alternate furrows. Where the irrigation is saline (EC up to 10 dS/m), apply rice-residue biochar 40 q/ha to reduce the adverse effect of salinity and increased yield.   Timely sowing of crop ensures good crop stand and crop also escapes the early attack of insect pests and diseases. Start the sowing from early April and complete by mid of May. Avoid sowing during noon hours of the day due to high temperature.
