PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION I am glad that the Personnel Division of the Council is bringing out the Second Edition of the Handbook on Agricultural Research Service. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research launched the New Personnel Policy a decade back. The formation of Agricultural Research Service was con- sidered a significant milestone in the organisation of research in the field of agricultural sciences in India. This Service has been in operation long enough for a meaningful evaluation of the various aspects of the Service. This has been done from time to time and the Second Edition of the Hand- book on Agricultural Research Service incorporates the changes which have been thus introduced. It is needless to emphasise that the focal point of the New Personnel Policy was to foster a spirit of co-operation in the place of unhealthy compe- tition. The career opportunities provided under the new system afford maximum encouragement to a dedicated worker. The changes introduced from time to time have been in this direction. I hope the Second Edition of the Handbook on Agricultural Research Service will be useful to all concerned. N. S. RANDHAWA New Delhi Director-General October3, 1985 Indian Council of Agricultural Research PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION THE Indian Council of Agricultural Research is probably the second largest organisation in agricultural research in the world in terms of the number of qualified scientists associated with it.
