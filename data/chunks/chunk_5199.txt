 To identify identical method of vinegar preparation, focused group interview was conducted. Fermentation by boiling emerged as another method of vinegar preparation. Both the methods (fermentation through sun-drying and boiling) were then compared. Twenty persons were interviewed.   FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT Matrix table was prepared on the ground through PRA exercise. The parameters or factors included in the study are given in Table 1. Experiment The experimental methods followed for validation were both organoleptic test, and laboratory method for ingredient analysis. The organoleptic evaluation was conducted in 10 replications through sensory evaluation method. The three methods of preparation of the beverage, i.e. vinegar fermented by boiling, vinegar fermented by sun drying and vinegar fermented by chemical, were prepared and tested organoleptically by a panel of 10 judges selected from the village as well as scientists of the university. The parameters included were colour, appearance, aroma, taste and overall acceptability. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study An attempt was made to assess two methods of vinegar preparation by use of PRA tools. The results given in Table 1 reveal that vinegar fermented by boiling is superior to that fermented by sun-drying. Vinegar fermented by boiling has the advantage of less time taken in its preparation, less labour requirement, durability of the product, and efficacy as medicine. On the contrary, vinegar fermented by sun-drying was f ound superior to that fermented by boiling, in terms of minimum materials used in preparation and cost effectiveness. Experiment Keeping in view the nutritive and therapeutic value, vinegar of jamun was prepared by two different processing techniques. Their organoleptic acceptability in respect of colour, appearance, aroma, taste and overall acceptability was judged by a panel of 10 judges using 9â€“point Hedonic Rating Scale. The data on sensory evaluation are presented in Table 2. The mean scores for orgnoleptic characteristics of vinegar fermented by boiling and that by sun- drying were organoleptically tested.
