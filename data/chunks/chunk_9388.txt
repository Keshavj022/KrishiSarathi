 It is estimated that annually 30 million tonne of biomass is produced through banana cultivation, from which there is scope to produce 1.5 million tonne of banana fibre across the country as by-product. The importance and use of banana fibre has been under exploited due to the lack of awareness and lack of systematic research on structural and physical properties of the fibre. From outer sheath, coarse fibre is extracted while fine fibre is extracted from the inner sheath. Both the fibres can be Fig. 5.

Small Agri-Enterprises and Waste Management: Gandhian Thoughts 114 Mahatma Gandhiâ€™s Vision of Agriculture: Achievements of ICAR utilized for making many kinds of handicrafts and household products like hand bags, purses, table mats, mobile cover, CD pouches, net bags, ornamental covers, door mats, curtains, file covers etc. There is a good scope for setting up of banana fibre based industry in India. It has been reported that about 300 kg of banana fibre which can fetch a value of about Rs. 1.2 lakhs can be extracted from nendran variety of banana plants from one hectare. It can provide employment generation to rural sector, particularly women. ICAR-CIAE has developed a package of equipment to mechanize the rope making process in collaboration with ICAR-NRC Banana, Trichy. The package of equipment consists of equipment for splitting the outer sheath of banana pseudo stem and twisting and winding of splitted strands (Naik et al. 2016). It has got advantages over manual method of twisting and winding in terms of more uniform twist, lower space requirement by 70-80%, less dependency on skilled labour by 65-70%, cheaper than manual labour and higher output (Fig. 6). The capacity of the equipment is 10,000 to 15,000 metre strands/day. The twisted rope is used for production of various eco-friendly handicraft materials like bags, window curtains, table mat etc which has huge demand both in local and international markets. There is a huge production of banana in the country and banana pseudo stem is mostly a waste product. Farmers have to make investment to clear the field for the next crop. The outer sheath of banana pseudo stem when processed for rope making would fetch about 2.4 lakh metre of banana sheath rope valued at Rs. 1.0 lakh ha-1. It is a win-win situation for all the persons in the supply chain. Fig. 6.

Value added products from banana central core About 12,000 to 15,000 kg of edible central cores can be extracted from one hectare of banana crop. It is rich in digestible fibres, iron, vitamins B3 and B5. It can also be blended with any other fruit pulp.
