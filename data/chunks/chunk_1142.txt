 In agronomic trials conducted during rabi 2011-12, HI 8713 showed significantly superior performance over checks: MPO 1215, HI 1544, HI 8498, GW 322 and plasticity to variations in sowing conditions. HI 8713 recorded more ear heads/sqm and number of grains/ear head compared to checks, which provided wide adaptability to this genotype. HI 8713 is showing consistent performance in AICW&BIP trials as national check in NIVT 4 and as zonal check for central zone in advance varietal trials (AVT) from rabi 2017-18 till now (Table 2). It is considered as zonal check in a timely sown AVT trial along with HI 8737, GW 322 and HI 1544. HI 8713 had shown consistent higher yield (57.9 q/ha) compared to other checks HI 8737 (56.4q/ha), GW 322 (54.0 q/ha) and HI 1544 (52.9 q/ha). Disease resistance and quality traits of HI 8713 HI 8713 recorded high degree of resistance against important diseases like stem and leaf rust, flag smut and leaf blight in comparison to checks during AICW&BIP trials. It showed resistance to durum virulent pathotypes of the leaf rust and stem rust indicating that the resistance spectrum is different from that of the checks. It showed high level of resistance to the African stem rust race ‘Ug99’ and its variants during screening in Kenya. The recent rust disease data from central zone AICW&BIP trials show HI 8713 is still resistant to major diseases, indicating its durable resistance. HI 8713 has high yellow pigment content (7.16 ppm), less gruel solid loss and high overall acceptability compared to the durum checks (Table 3). It showed parity with the check varieties in other desired quality traits like grain appearance, protein content, test weight, etc. indicating its suitability for pasta making. HI 8713 has high protein content (12%) along with essential micronutrients, viz. iron content (36 ppm), zinc content (34 ppm) and copper content (6 ppm) which makes it the best choice for inclusion in ‘Nutrifarm scheme’ of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India which includes 25 districts in Madhya Pradesh. It can serve as a dual quality durum suitable both for excellent pasta preparations as well as HI 8713 (Pusa Mangal) growing in field Table 1.
