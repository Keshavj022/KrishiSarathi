Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/ species): Beauveria bassiana ICAR-NBAIR Bb-5a strain has been identified as a promising microbial biocontrol agent for management of aphids in chilli & brinjal (Aphis gossypii), cabbage (Brevicoryne brassicae) and cowpea (Aphis craccivora). Oil formulation has been developed with shelf life of 12 months. It is ecologically safe and do not have any deleterious effects on non- target organisms, other living organisms in the environment, unlike chemical insecticides. 2.
