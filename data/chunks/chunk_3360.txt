Draft Document National Agricultural Education Project ICAR EDUCATION DIVISION 2012 2 Indian Council of Agricultural Research Department of Agricultural Research & Education Detailed Project Report of the National Agricultural Education Project (NAEP) 1. Introduction Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for over 80% of the rural poor in India. Although, it employs about 52% of the labor force, it contributes to only 14.4% of GDP and 10.23% of all exports. Rural women, who constitute 30% of the agricultural work force, are amongst the least paid workers. Any effort of poverty reduction and economic development must address the problems being faced by the agricultural sector and turn the challenges into economic opportunities for the poor. India achieved spectacular agricultural growth since 1966. The increase in food grain production from a meager 51 million tonnes in 1950 to about 245 million tonnes in 2011-12 is a remarkable achievement unparallel in the history of world agriculture. Similar enhancement in production of milk, fish, oilseeds and fruit & vegetables has also been observed. Green, blue, yellow and white revolutions have been responsible for bringing in prosperity to the farming community. The cradle of the success, besides government policies and high receptivity of the farming community, has been the establishment of institutions of higher agricultural education. These institutions developed new breed of skilled human resource who were instrumental in not only generating new technologies but also in their assessment, refinement and dissemination to the farming community. Human Resource development is critical for sustaining, diversifying and realizing the potentials of agriculture.
