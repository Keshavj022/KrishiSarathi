   Sowing should be done in line through ICAR-CRIJAF Multi-row seed drill machine and required seed rate will be only 350 - 400 gm/bigha. Line sowing with row spacing of 20-25 cm and sowing at depth of 3 cm are recommended. Cotton   Use Indoxacarb 14.5% Sc @ 360 ml/ha or Rynaxypyr 18.5 % SC @ 150 ml/ha two times at 15 days interval to control spotted boll worm and helicoverpa during boll development stage.   After harvesting the seed cotton proper sun drying should be done before bagging. Vegetables Okra   Use Okra varieties like Utkal Gourav, Arka Anamika, Varsha Uphar, Parvani kranti, Makra etc. may be sown at 3.4kg per acre. Apply 10 cartloads of FYM per acre during final land preparation and apply 45:25 :35kg NPK/acre as basal for improved vars. and 20-25 cartloads of FYM per acre during final land preparation and apply 80:40:40 kg NPK/acre as basal for improved vars. For line sowing use 5 to 7 Kg. seeds/acre for improved Vars. and 1250 to 1500 g seeds/acre for hybrid Vars. To control Red spider mite in okra, go for application of Kelthane @ 200 g/acre at weekly interval. Bittergourd   Bitter gourd varieties like Pusa domausami, Coimbatore long, Priya, Arka harit etc. may be sown during this time. For 1 acre, 1.5kg seeds are required. For land preparation, apply 5 ton FYM and 100kg ammonium sulfate 75 kg SSP and 35 kg MOP. First harvesting can be done at 55-60 days after sowing. Ridge gourd   Ridge gourd varieties like Pusa nasdaar, Utkal Manjushree, Utkal Trupti, Swarna manjari etc.∙ may be sown with 1.5-2kg/acre. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 74   Apply 5-ton FYM and 100kg ammonium sulfate 75 kg SSP and 50 kg MOP. Dig the pit at a spacing of 2m x 1.5m. In each pit sow 3 seeds.   To control leaf spot in ridge gourd, spray 3.5 ml Indofil M-45 in 1 litre water. Cucumber   Cucumber varieties like Poinsette, Pusa sanjog, Supriya, Malini etc. may be sown during this part of year at 1.5-2kg/acre.   Apply 5 ton FYM and 100kg ammonium sulfate 75 kg SSP and 35 kg MOP. Dig the pit at a spacing of 2m x 1.5m. In each pit sow 3 seeds. Onion   To prevent Onion tip burn, apply 400ml Hexaconazole by mixing in 200lt water and spray over 1 acre. By now Onion must be ready for harvesting, so don’t apply irrigation. Fruit crops (Mango, guava & litchi)   To control fruit drop in all the three crops, spray NAA 4.5% W/W (Planofix) @ 0.2 ml/lt at 10- 12 days interval.   For better fruit development, spray n-triacontanol (Miraculan) @ 0.5 ml/lt at 15 days interval.   Keep sufficient moisture in the orchard basin. Mulching with straw or grass may be practiced for better soil moisture conservation. Litchi   To prevent fruit cracking, maintain sufficient moisture during hot summer of May. Regular watering is compulsory. Mulching with straw or grass around the tree basin is helpful for better soil moisture conservation.
