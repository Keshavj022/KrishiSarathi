4 tonnes, of cowpea C 152, Vamban 1, RC 19 and GC 3 to the extent of 2.88 tonnes and of mothbean RMO 40, RMO 257, RMO 225, IPCMO 912, Jawala, FMM 96 and CAZRI Moth 1 around 4.26 tonnes. Crop Production At Bangalore and Pattambi, horsegram PHG 9 with recommended 20 kg N + 25 Kg P2O5 + 10 kg K2O + weed control and plant protection could yield 72.1% higher over recommended dose of fertilizer alone. On cowpea, spray of 500 ppm thiourea at vegetative and flowering stages proved effective in giving higher yield (19.0%) compared to control at Hisar and Durgapura. Sulphur at 40 kg/ha increased grain yield of guar by about 33.0% over 20 kg S/ha at Bikaner and Gwalior. Further 50% S through gypsum and 50% through elemental form proved most effective. Crop Protection In nutrient-deficient soils, inoculation of Mycorrhiza, Azotobacter and Rhizobium in guar resulted in the best management of root-rot diseases. In cowpea, Thiram at 3 g/kg of seed, followed by 3 sprays of Carbendazim at 15 days interval, starting from 15 days of seedling emergence, has been effective in decreasing root-rot infection. Cowpea GC 9714 proved quite resistant to storage grains pest (Callosobruchus chinensis). Quality Aspects In normal maturing group of cowpea genotypes, V 585 had maximum crude protein (27.3%), lower value of cooking time (16 min.) and in-vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) contents (46.5%). Mothbean RMO 435, CZM 35 and CZM 57 have showed maximum crude protein, to the extent of 27.0%. In IVPD, CZM 35 (53.2%) and RMG 24 (52.8%) were better. ● ●● ●● Pre-cooking water soaking of lathyrus dal for 4-6 hr reduced 27-30% β-oxalyl diamino propionic acid, a neurotoxic compound. ● ●● ●● Mothbean RMO 435, CZM 35 and CSM 57 showed maximum crude protein, to the extent of 27%. ● In nutrient -deficient soils Mycorrhiza, Azotobacter and Rhyzobium inoculation to guar helped in management of root-rot diseases. CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 37 COMMERCIAL CROPS COTTON Crop Improvement Pratima, a Gossypium hirsutum variety, and Bunny, an intra-hirsutum hybrid, have been released for commercial cultivation in the irrigated tracts of south zone. A G.hirsutum high-yielding, medium-staple, early-maturing CNH 120 MB has been identified for release in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Hybrid CSHH 25, resistant to cotton leaf curl virus (CLCuV), has showed an increase of 14.63% 59.59% and 66.93% for seed-cotton yield over hybrids LHH 144, HHH 81 and Raj HH 16. It is proposed for release in Haryana and Rajasthan. A ‘desi’ genotype DLSA 17 developed by the CICR, Nagpur, has recorded a seed-cotton yield of 1,955 kg/ha, and has also showed fibre quality characters at a par with G.hirsutum. A new source of cytoplasmic male sterility with aridum cytoplasm has been developed at the CICR, Nagpur. Crop Production Deep tillage once in 2 years plus conventional tillage had led to significantly higher seed-cotton yield in Faridkot and Sriganganagar.
