 Bulls of eighth set were evaluated on the basis of their daughters, and the overall breeding value was 3012.58 kg. Semen collection and freezing: Frozen semen doses of Frieswal (573,179), Gir (68,407), Kankrej (2,995) and Sahiwal bulls (20,974), were produced at respective Germ plasm units; and 78,739 doses were distributed to Military Farms and 63,826 sold to para vets, State Animal Husbandry Departments, Livestock Development Boards and State Agriculture Universities. Semen doses are available for Frieswal (1,937,000), Gir (121,848), Kankrej (111,690) and Sahiwal (83,802). Buffalo Network Project on Buffalo Improvement (NPBI): Bulls (15) of XVI set were used in herd for test mating. In addition 6 bulls from CIRB Hisar, were tentatively selected for XVII set for test mating under progeny testing. NDRI Karnal; CIRB Hisar; GADVASU Ludhiana; and LUVAS Hisar produced >2,400 kg average standard lactation milk yield (SLMY) during the period, where LUVAS Hisar, recorded the highest 305 or less day milk yield (2,967 kg) among all centres. Except for Mamnoor centre, average age at first calving and calving intervals ranged between 39 and 45 months and 428 and 481 days, respectively. Nili-Ravi, Bhadawari and Swamp breed centres are functioning as conservation and improvement units, whereas, Jaffarabadi, Pandharpuri and Surti breed centres are concentrating on field progeny testing along with maintaining the elite herd for bull production and a breedable herd of 567 (Nili-Ravi-243, Jaffarabadi-167, Pandharpuri-26, Swamp-27, Surti-53, and Bhadawari- 59) is being maintained. Semen doses (123,559) were produced from Jaffarabadi, Surti, Pandharpuri, Bhadawari, Nili Ravi and Swamp breeds. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 49 LIVESTOCK IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 50 Field progeny testing (FPT) of bulls: During the period, 3,807 artificial inseminations using semen of 15 Murrah test bulls of 16th set were done with conception rate of 55.48% in 10 adopted villages. In this period, 2,112 pregnancies were confirmed and 1,661 calving (864 males, 797 females) were recorded. In addition monthly test day milk yield were recorded of 170 progeny of 12th, 152 of 13th and 3 of 14th set that calved during this period. Average age at first calving for these 170 daughters was 42.04 months. CIRB Hisar - Murrah herd: Semen doses (126,008) were frozen and semen straws (54,546) were sold in the field for insemination. At CIRB Hisar, the highest ever (since inception of the Institute) 305 days or less average lactation milk yield of 2,457 kg (n=133) and average total lactation milk yield of 2,567 kg (n=133) were achieved. The highest ever lactation milk yield of 4,063 kg in 305 days and highest peak yield of 23.2 kg in a single day was recorded. CIRB Sub-campus - Nili-Ravi Herd: Semen straws (18,790) were produced and 9,450 straws were sold.
