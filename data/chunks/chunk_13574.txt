 3.2. Energy use efficiency of major crops The calculated total energy output for sugarcane, including both the main product and the by-product, was 4.31 lakh MJ ha−1, whereas for seasonal crops, it was ranging between 1.09 lakh MJ ha−1 (for maize) and 2.19 lakh MJ ha−1 (for paddy) production (Table 4). The massive generation of paddy straw as a by-product account for the high energy output in paddy. Sugarcane had recorded a net energy gain of 3.71 lakh MJ ha−1, but paddy had the largest gain among seasonal crops, at 1.83, showing that paddy production in Punjab uses less energy than other crops. 1.56 lakh MJ ha−1 for cotton, 0.94 lakh MJ ha−1 for wheat, and 0.90 lakh MJ ha−1 for maize were recorded. For all other crops, the energy usage efficiency (EUE) ranged from 5 to 8, with cotton having the highest EUE at 7.79 lakh MJ ha−1. Paddy was found to be more energy efficient than cotton, despite the fact that paddy production by trans­ planting is associated with a higher usage of electricity and other energy Fig. 1.

Similar findings were reached in earlier studies on the south- western Punjab region when an EUE of 5.0 for the transplanted paddy system was noted. According to a specific energy (SE) analysis, cotton required about 10.76 MJ kg−1 of energy, compared to 6.77 MJ kg−1 for paddy, 4 MJ kg−1 for maize, 0.96 MJ kg−1 for sugarcane, and about 4 MJ kg−1 for wheat. Equivalent findings came from a comparison study conducted in China, where cotton’s SE (4.78 kWh kg−1) was much higher than rice’s (1.49 kWh kg−1), implying that cotton farms need three times the amount of energy needed by rice to yield one kilogram of marketable commodity [61]. Wheat was reported to exhibit the lowest SE of the seasonal crops, at 4.4 MJ kg−1. Madhya Pradesh based previous study on wheat produced similar conclusions; the output to input energy ratio and SE were 3.9 and 3.7 MJ kg−1, respectively [62]. Greater energy intensity, or SE, suggests an existing potential to further increase the energy utilization of Bt cotton production and transplanted paddy in Punjab.
