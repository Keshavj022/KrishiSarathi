 To ensure a steep increase in yield, maize researchers will devote to: @ development of higher-yielding hybrids for high-productive areas and composites for the less-productive areas development of single-cross hybrids widening the choice of rabi hybrids/varieties tailoring varieties for varied industrial use. SORGHUM pay An NG Dual-purpose sorghum CSH 13R « Kharif sorghum SPV 946 has now been released as CSV 15 for growing in rabi as well a breakthrough in production Sorghum had been a traditional self-pollinated crop until the ICAR started exploring the possibilities of hybrid technology in 1960 and followed with the All- India Coordinated Sorghum Improvement Project in 1969. Sorghum is cultivated in 13-14 million hectares, assuming importance after the rice and wheat. Most of itis rainfed. CSH 1, the first hybrid of sorghum, produced 3 tonnes per hectare even when rainfed. Over years the hybrids released have in general given 3-4 tonnes per hectare in the rainy season (kharif) and 4-5 tonnes per hectare in the winter season (rabi). Hybrids CSH1, CSH5, CSH6, CSH 9, CSH 10, CSH 11 and varieties CSV 10, CSV 14, SPV 462, CSV 8R and SWATIare for kharif growing, while CSH 13R and CSH 15R are for rabi growing. Major yield constraint in kharif sorghum is the grain mould; much of the produce therefore finds use in the beverage industry. Rabi sorghum, consumed largely as foodgrain, is affected by the shoot-fly. IN FUTURE... Even though the land planted with sorghum has declined from 18 million hectares to 13 million hectares, the adoption of superior hybrids and varieties have sustained the production level. Further work will lead to: @ development of dual purpose — grain and fodder — rabi sorghum hybrids. Combining superior grain quality and resistance to shoot-fly @ development of hybrids and varieties for kharif that will combine resistance to grain mould @ development of varieties for diverse industrial use.

Many more hybrids and composites have followed with an ability to yield 2.0-2.5 tonnes/ha. They have raised the total production to 8.72 million tonnes that was less than athird, 2.84 million tonnes in 1950. The corresponding average productivity of these hybrids and composites is 824 kg/ha and 306 kg/ha. The recently released hybrids are HHB 67, PUSA 322, GHB 15, VBH 4, RHRBH 8609, EK-NATH 301, MLBH 104, GHB 235 and HHB 68.
