0m (400 plants/ha) young orchard • Planting of banana from March to May, June and February were found ideal under Assam, Kovvur and Mohanpur conditions, respectively. While planting of Nendran is remunerative during all the seasons under Kannara conditions, however, planting during October is remunerative with an eye on production during off‐season and exports. • A fertilizer dose of 600g N, 225‐300g P2O5, 450‐600 g K2O with 7.5 to 15kg neemcake in sweet orange at Tirupati and acid lime at Periyakulam, Rahuri and Tirupati and Khasi mandarin at Tinsukia has been recommended. • For sweet orange at Tirupati, application of 800 g N (50% as urea, 25% as FYM and 25% as oil cakes) along with 200 g P2O5 and 400 K2O / plant / year can also be recommended. • Foliar application of 1 to 2% of 13: 0: 46 N: P2O5 : K2O fertilizer mix or 2% potassium nitrate may be resorted to improve fruit size and yield of Kinnow mandarin at Ludhiana and Khasi mandarin at Tinsukia. • At Arabhavi, application of N and K (200 g each) in 6 splits can be recommended for Rajapuri banana (AAB). • In banana application of 75 per cent recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF‐200g each of N and K2O per plant per year) at Arabhavi (Robusta), Jalgaon (Grand Naine) and Kannara (Robusta) and 50 per cent RDF at Kovvur through drip was sufficient for Karpura Chakkerakeli (AAB, Mysore). • In papaya application of 75 per cent recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF‐50g each of N and K2O per plant per year) at Coimbatore for CO.2 recorded higher yield. • Application of copper oxychloride (0.3%) and 2, 4 – D (10 ppm) resulted in higher fruit retention and yield of Kinnow mandarin at Ludhiana over a two year period. This treatment also provided higher benefit: cost ratio and the technology could be passed on to the growers for adoption. • Effective weed control in Rajapuri banana was observed by growing double crop of cowpea and its incorporation into the soil. • The best crop sequence in banana as intercrops are onion at Arabhavi Knolkhol and elephant foot yam at Jorhat, cowpea at Jalgaon, Amorphophallus and Colocasia at Kovvur and cabbage at Mohanpur. • Blackfly in citrus was effectively controlled by spray of acephate (0.1125%) or imidacloprid (0.005%) or releases of 4 to 6 eggs per shoot of Mallada boninensis during Hasta bahar under Maharashtra conditions has been found to be effective. • Neem based insecticide azadirachtin 1% at 5 ml per litre spray on the pseudo stem + chopped pseudo stem is very effective for the IPM of pseudo stem borer of banana (Odoiporus longicollis). • Application of carbosulfan (0.05%) or fenobucarb (0.1%) or Polytrin‐C (0.044%) or profenophos (0.075%) or acephate (0.1125%) or endosulfan (0.07%) when sprayed three times at 15 days interval contributed maximum reduction of incidence of leaf webber, bud worm and fruit flies in sapota.
