Experiment To determine the efficiency of controlling weeds (Cyperus rotundus and Cynodon dactylon) in irrigated sugarcane, pomegranate and grape, the following three treatments were imposed: 1 Sowing of Amaranthus in infested patches of C. rotundus and C. dactylon 2. Spraying of 20% urea solution on C. rotundus and C. dactylon Table 1.

Farmers’ practice (two weedings and one hoeing for sugarcane, two hoeing, clearing and earthing up of grape and pomegranate ) . In addition, the weedy check plot was maintained. Before sowing of Amaranthus and spraying of urea on area of 0.5×0.5 m was selected for weed count in each treatment. Weed coun was recorded before and 6 weeks after sowing in case of Amaranthus,and 3–4 weeks after spraying of 20% urea. Similar count was also recorded in weedy CROPS AND CROPPING SYSTEMS  Table 2.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The effect of different methods for control of Cyperus rotandus and Cynodon dactylon is illustrated in Table 2. It is observed that control of Cyperus rotandus in all the plots of sugarcane, pomegranate and grape was highest by Amaranthus sowing with weed control of efficiency of 35.85%, 33.91% and 38.46% for sugarcane, pomegranate and grape, respectively. It is followed by farmers’ practice in sugarcane and pomegranate. Urea spray gave second best result in grape. In case of Cynodon dactylon, farmers’ practice gave best result in sugarcane (weed control efficiency of 11%) and grape (weed control effecinecy of 14.32%), whereas urea spray proved to be the best (15.08%) for weed control in pomegranate field. CONCLUSION The results obtained indicate that growing of Amaranthus is effective in controlling Cyprus rotundus. However, this practice is not effective for controlling Cynodon dactylon. –  CROPS AND CROPPING SYSTEMS Code : 328 Title of the ITK : Banana as an indicator plant to irrigate sugarcane Description of the ITK : In the sugarcane plot one or two plants of banana are planted.
