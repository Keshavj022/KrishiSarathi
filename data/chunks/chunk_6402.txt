The culture collection has received 14 new microbial genera, viz. Achromobacter sp., Amycolatopsis sp., Aneurinibacillus sp., Caballeronia sp., Citricoccus sp., Fictibacillus sp., Ignatzschineria sp., Kitasatospora sp., Komagaetibacter sp., Kosokonia sp., Pantoea sp., Photorabdus sp., Providencia sp., and Rahnella sp. during the reporting period. The fungal diversity collection has enriched with 11 new genera namely, Actinomortierella sp., Athelia sp., Calonectria sp., Coryceps sp., Corynespora sp., Lasiodplodia sp., Nortierella sp., Scopulorioposis sp., Stemphylium sp., Talaromyces sp., and Trametes sp. under the general deposit category. The total revenue generated was R 5,67,600 during 2022-2023 for culture supply to the different stakeholders across Indian states, including private and public sectors. A total of 46 microbial cultures have been accessioned under safe deposition from various government and private institutions, which has generated a revenue of R 4,53,000.
