8 59.1 47.7 60.3 50.9 7.5 INTRODUCING SUPERIMPOSITION OF TREATMENTS Continuous use of nutrient either singly or in combination or integration with FYM resulted in either very high build of P and Zn fertility or accentuated the deficiencies of sulfur and micronutrients, high soil acidity, excessive depletion of P or K. The build‐up of P may cause environmental problem and the deficiency of nutrients adversely affect the sustainability of the system. To sustain the productivity and to avoid the wasteful expenditure on excessive P, interventions were required, www.icar.org.in 48 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Natural Resource Management therefore in few selected treatments superimpositions were implemented using nested plot design in one of the replications preserving the original.

Response of crops to nutrients Average responses of crops to nutrients and amendments presented in table 7 revealed that the response of all the crops to N in majority of cases is negative except in maize at Palampur. The positive response of N in maize is due to very good response of N in first 10 years of experimentation (Table 8). The negative response of crop to N suggests that application of N instead of improving the yield, it has rather deteriorated. Contrary to this, crops response to P, K, and S is conspicuous. The response of crops to S at Ranchi is, however, negative. Phosphorus response in wheat at Ranchi is as high as 21 q ha‐1, and the maximum K response in finger millet recorded is 33 q ha‐1at Bangalore, whereas S registered maximum response to extent of 13.9 q ha‐1 in maize at Palampur. The response of crop to lime ranged from 1.2 to 8.95 q ha‐1 with exception of negative response of lime in finger millet at Bangalore. The negative response of finger millet to lime is due to acid environment loving nature of the crop. The Response of crops to FYM ranged from 3.66 to 14.27 q ha‐1 in Alfisols under LTFE. Thus, LTFE results clearly brought out that to sustain productivity of Alfisol balanced use of nutrients is a primary requirement. Table 7.
