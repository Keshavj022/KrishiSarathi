 Unique of its kind in the world, the Central Rice Research Institute at Cuttack Analysing soil samples for heavy metal (Orissa) set up in 1945, addresses to all problems of the rice plant. contents, CRRI, Cuttack The AlHndia Coordinated Rice Improvement Project instituted in 1965 facilitates rapid generation and identification of high-yielding varieties for different ecologies through multidisciplinary research-based multilocation testing. The yield barrier in our tropical rice has been crossed over with “Dee-Gee-Wu- Gen” dwarfing gene sourced from the semi-dwarf short-durationed, day-neutral, fertilizer-responsive variety TAICHUNG NATIVE 1 introduced from Taiwan. The yield has been stepped up from 3 tonnes/ha to 7 tonnes/ha.

India is the second country after China to have commercialized the hybrid technology. Hybrid rice APHR 1, APHR 2, KRH 1, MGR 1, CRH 1 and PHB 71 yield 1.0-1.5 tonnes/ha more than the best ruling variety in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. IN FUTURE... Rice is 42 per cent of the total foodgrains (190 million tonnes) produced at present in the country. By AD 2000, 95 million tonnes of rice, and then on 25— 30 million tonnes additionally every decade is our projected requirement. The focus of research will shift to: @ consolidation of yield levels in irrigated ecology @ maximization of yield in diverse rainfed and critical ecologies @ raising of the genetic yield ceiling through physiologically more productive plant types and intensification of the hybrid rice technology. The ICAR is on its way to developing super-yielders with built-in resistance to all stresses. Disease resistance and grain quality have been identified with the varieties of wheat evolved from 1905 to the mid-sixties.
