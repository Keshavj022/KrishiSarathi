Spatio-temporal variations of irrigation intensity in Karnataka Irrigation intensity played a crucial role in the agricultural development of different regions, exerting significant influence on cropping patterns, crop combinations, and overall agricultural efficiency. This study centered on Karnataka, where the net irrigated area witnessed an expansion from 2.82×106 hm2 during 2004–2005 to 4.03×106 hm2 during 2018–2019, highlighting the increasing importance of irrigation. During 2004–2005, irrigation intensity varied from 3.19% to 56.39%, revealing a substantial difference of 53.20% between the districts with the lowest (Kodagu District) and highest (Shimoga District) irrigation intensity (Table 2; Fig. 3a). During 2018–2019, irrigation intensity changed from 0.77% (Kodagu District) to 72.77% (Dakshin Kannad District), with a substantial difference of 72.00% (Table 2; Fig. 3b).

Spatio-temporal distribution of irrigation intensity in Karnataka during 2004–2005 (a) and 2018–2019 (b). variation, the study categorized irrigation intensity into four classes. Shimoga and Dakshin Kannad districts had the high irrigation intensity (>55.00%) during 2004–2005 and 2018–2019. During 2018–2019, Bagalkot and Belgaum districts joined this category with high irrigation intensity. It was noteworthy that positive variation in irrigation intensity surpassed 10.00% in 18 districts including Bagalkot, Belgaum, Bellary, Bengaluru Urban, Bijapur, Chamarajanagar, Chikmagalur, Chitradurga, Dakshin Kannad, Davangere, Haveri, Mandya, Raichur, Shimoga, Tumkur, Udupi, Uttar Kannad, and Yadgir districts, with Yadgir District showing the largest variation in irrigation intensity of 24.33%. Belgaum, Bagalkot, and Mandya districts exhibited moderately high irrigation intensity in 2004–2005. However, these three districts transitioned to high irrigation intensity during 2018–2019, with a significant 12.88% rise of irrigation intensity in Mandya district. During 2018–2019, Davangere, Bellary, Raichur, Yadgir, Mysore, Chamarajanagar, and Udupi districts showed moderately high irrigation intensity, demonstrating positive improvements in irrigation intensity. Simultaneously, Mysore and Bidar districts transitioned from very low to low irrigation intensity classes, with the positive variation ranging from 5.00% to 10.00%. During 2004–2005, very low irrigation intensity class (<25.
