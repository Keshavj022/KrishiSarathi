Spraying with Karathane or Bavistin @ 2 g/litre of water is effective to control this disease. Sulphur dust or spray should not be done to control any fungal disease in bitter gourd as it is very sensitive to sulphur. Downy mildew symptoms appear as irregularly shape yellow to brown angular spots appear on upper sides of the leaves. Under moist condition, a purplish mildew typically develops on the underside of the leaf spots. Spraying of Redomil MZ @ 2.5 g/L of water at 10-15 days interval can control this disease. Bitter gourd is a host of watermelon potyvirus, cucumber green mottle virus (both transmitted by white fly), and bitter gourd mosaic virus (transmitted by aphid). Uprooting and destruction of affected plants and collateral hosts is a common means of control. The whitefly can be controlled by spraining Carbaryl 50WP @ 2 ml/L of water or Spinosid @1 ml/4 L of water. July–August 2023 7 Table 3.

The anthesis occurs in majority of gourds in morning. Pollination generally takes place between 6 am to 8 am. It is cross pollinated by nature and extent of cross pollination ranges from 60 to 80% depending upon the environment and visit of the insect. It is evident that insect do not distinguish flowers from the same or different plants at the time of voluntary pollination. The major insect that acts as pollinator is mostly bees (Apis florae and A. dorsata). The beetles like Conpophilous sp., moths like Plasmodia sp., etc. also help in pollination.
