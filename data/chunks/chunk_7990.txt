 In another survey in Karnataka, 8.31% PPR incidence was observed. The estimated mortality loss, cost of treatment, distress sale and opportunity cost of labor among the infected flock was ` 3,231, 108.2, 3,040, and 15.7/animal, respectively. Further, a questionnaire was developed to assess the risk factors for occurrence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). Sero- positive samples (62) were screened for PRRSV by Risk map for anthrax in Karnataka showing high risk and low risk areas LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 66 RT- PCR, out of which 22 samples were found positive. Clinical samples received from different regions of India were screened by PCR and 61 clinical samples (3/20 from Sikkim, 1/2 from Kerala, 1/2 from Telangana, 3/10 from Karnataka, 2/27 from Madhya Pradesh) were found positive for torque teno virus (TTSuV) infection. Out of 2,008 serum samples received from NER states screened for the prevalence of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) antibodies revealed prevalence in Asom (20.54%), Mizoram (37.13%), Meghalaya (21.3%), Manipur (44.07%), Sikkim (36.11%) and Tripura (10.57%). Meta-analysis of 10 CSFV study data from seven states of NER with 1,323 samples revealed the seoprevalance of CSFV as 31% and for bluetongue (BT) as 35% prevalence. Three multiplex PCR for detection of BTV serotypes 5 and 9, 3, 13 and 16 and 10 and 24 were developed, optimized, and specificity was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The predominant isolates in Karnataka belonged to BTV 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 16, 23, and 24. From small ruminants, 411 serum samples were received from the NE states and on screening 88 samples were found positive for BTV antibodies by C-ELISA. Highest prevalence was in Manipur whereas the lowest in Asom. In another study 8,000 Culicoides specimens from 31 sites near the wildlife sanctuaries were entrapped; among them 13 major Culicoides species were found. The selected Culicoides species were DNA bar coded and BTV was detected in C.oxystoma and C.imicola samples. The results indicated that there is a circulation of Culicoides species in forest habitats and presence of BTV in some Culicoides species. During this period, 9,923 bovine sera samples from different states of India were screened for the IBR antibodies using Avidin- Biotin ELISA– in Chhattisgarh showed the highest prevalence rate with 50.54%; whereas, Nagaland showed the least with 6.80% with overall 33.79% positive on screening of 2,418 bovine samples from NE states. Isolates (16) of bovine herpes virus (BoHV) from Karnataka, Odisha, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh were maintained in virus repository. Screening of 2,077 Lymnaea spp. snails collected from 25 waterbodies covering 11 districts of Karnataka for infection of Fasciola gigantica by PCR targeting ITS 2 region, revealed the 5.1% of snails were positive for Fasciola gigantica; Deccan plateau of Karnataka showed the highest positivity with 5.79% followed by 5.22% in Western Ghats and 3.
