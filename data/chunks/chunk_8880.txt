 On farm study was conducted to assess the effect of cutting management practices with varying phosphorus and nitrogen levels on growth and seed yield of coriander. Highest seed yield (2.56 tonnes/ ha) was recorded at single cutting at 30 DAS, while no cutting and 2 cuttings produced lower yield. Maximum plant height (70.5 cm) was recorded in maximum level of phosphorus (45 kg/ha). Maximum plant height (82.5 cm), maximum branches/plant (19.7) and highest yield/ha (4.51 tonnes/ha) was recorded with maximum dose of N at 40 kg/ha. Earlier dates of sowing(during 20th March to 5th May) in Bhindi variety GANGA DIARA LAND MANAGEMENT In varietal cum manurial trial at Sabour, Bihar sunflower variety MSFH gave the highest yield of 2.29 tonnes/ha followed by 3302 and PAC 36 whereas pointed gourd variety “Hilly” registered the highest yield of 12.4 tonnes/ha. Blackgram (kalai) forage followed by either wheat or gram in rabi gave significant higher return. Blackgram (grain) + gram with net return of Rs 21,708.15 ha and blackgram + lentil sequences were found to be successful as alternative cropping sequence in Diara Land. In intercropping, sunflower + carrot combination fetched significantly higher return of Rs 51,992/ha with full dose of recommended fertilizer. Two hand weeding at 30 and 40 days after sowing in wheat gave similar yields as of application of weedicide Pendimethylene. NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 77 Pusa Sawani resulted in better vegetative growth and higher yield, which gradually decreased towards later dates of sowing. Rice Water Management in different Locations At Bilaspur, in sandy clay loam soils, grain yield (5.26 tonnes/ha) of rice was obtained by scheduling 7 cm irrigation at 1 day after drying (DAD).Transplanted rice proved superior over direct seeding. At Chiplima, in sandy loam soils, continuous shallow submergence of 5 + 2 cm produced maximum grain yield (4.16 tonnes/ha) of summer rice with 180 : 80 : 80 kg NPK/ha. At Faizabad, in silt clay loam soils, 7 cm irrigation at 1 DAD produced 6.19 tonnes/ha optimum yield with 150 kg N/ha as fertilizers and 30 kg N/ha as FYM. At Jorhat, in sandy loam soils, highest grain yield of 3.91 tonnes/ha of summer rice was obtained by scheduling 5 cm irrigation at 3 DAD with response to fertilizers observed up to 80 : 40 : 40 kg NPK/ha. At Pantnagar, in silt clay loam soils, maximum rice grain yield of 5.75 tonnes/ha was obtained by scheduling 7 cm irrigation at 3 DAD requiring 2 irrigations under shallow water-table conditions. At Pusa, maximum grain yield (2.85 tonnes/ha) of early rice was obtained by scheduling 7 cm irrigation at 1 DAD with 100 kg N/ha. While maximum grain yield (3.21 tonnes/ha) of timely sown rice was obtained by scheduling 5 + 2 cm irrigation at 3 DAD requiring 3 irrigations. Water Management in Wheat Under rice-wheat cropping system at Faizabad, a variable irrigation schedule of IW/CPE =1.2 up to dough stage produced maximum grain yield (3.
