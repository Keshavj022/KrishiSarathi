 Free radicals, electrons, and other charged particles produced during the ionisation process can interact with biological matter in a variety of ways. In this article, we discussed what plasma agriculture is, how it works, its potential benefits and limitations. What is plasma agriculture? Plasma agriculture is an innovative method of farming that makes use of plasma to boost plant development, safeguard crops from pests and diseases, and improve the nutritional value of food crops. When an electric field is applied to a gas, such as air or nitrogen, it ionises the gas and produces a high-energy plasma. There are several methods to employ plasma to enhance agriculture. For instance, it can be used to disinfect soil, get rid of pests and diseases, improve plant nutrient uptake, and boost crop production. By utilising electrodes or plasma jets, a plasma field is produced around the plants in plasma agriculture. This plasma field accelerates the plant’s metabolism, improves ‘nutrition and absorption’ and strengthens its immune system. It has been demonstrated that plasma agriculture increases crop output, boosts nutrient content, and lowers pesticide use. Plasma agriculture is still a relatively new technology, and there is ongoing research to Indian Farming 18 October 2023 understand how it works and how it can be optimized for various crops. However, early results are promising, and plasma agriculture is already being used in some countries to grow crops such as tomatoes, lettuce, and strawberries. When a gas is heated to a high temperature, it is ionised and becomes plasma. Plasma is the fourth state of matter, very reactive, interacts with matter and is an excellent tool for farming and enhancing soil fertility. Though new to agriculture, plasma technology is already in use for many years in a variety of sectors, including electronics, manufacturing, and medical. The process involves surrounding the plants with a plasma field, which produces a number of reactive molecular species, such as nitric oxide, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide. These species have positive effects on plant growth, including increased photosynthesis, improved nutrient uptake, and increased resistance to pests and diseases. Plasma agriculture has emerged as a response to the challenges faced by traditional agricultural practices and the increasing demand for sustainable solutions. With the global population growing, the need to produce more food while reducing the environmental impact of agriculture has become critical. The application of plasma technology in agriculture aims to address these concerns and capitalize on the potential benefits it offers. One of the key motivations for exploring plasma agriculture is the urgency to develop sustainable agricultural practices. Conventional methods often rely heavily on chemical inputs, leading to soil degradation, water pollution, and environmental harm.
