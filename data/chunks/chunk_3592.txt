 Under such conditions, suitable pollinizers are required for pollination. Staminate flowers are mauve in colour, 1-1.5 cm long, sessile in short peduncles and mostly three-flowered. Female flower is also mauve but larger than male flower and it has four lobbed large dark green calyx. The tree bears flowers in February-April and fruits become ripe in May-June. Its fruit develops from the superior ovary and drupe type of fruit. Calyx remains attached to fruits which provide better attachment to fruits with branches. The fruit is olive green, while the shape is ovoid or globose and it comprises 1-8 seeds but generally 4 seeds occur. The edible portion of this fruit is yellow pulp. The taste of this fruit is sweet with mild aroma. This fruit can be grown in a wide range of soil; forest soil with high humus content is very suitable for the cultivation of this fruit. It is hardy in nature and can be grown in rocky soils. It can grow where annual temperature varies from 0o to 48o C and annual rainfall ranges from 500 to 1,500 mm. The seeds are recalcitrant and lose their viability within a short period. There is a lack of information on the propagation of tendu fruit. Most of the plants available in the forest are naturally regenerated through seedlings. The vegetative propagation can be done through budding and grafting during January to March. Nutritional composition The fruit is very nutritive and rich in sugar, fibre, protein and ascorbic acid. It is also a very good source of phenols, carotene, flavonoids, terpenoids, saponin and tannin. The tendu fruit comprises moisture (79.1-82.4%), protein (0.43-0.58%), crude fibre (0.37-0.49%), TSS (16.20-19.50oBrix), glucose (1.05-11.90%), fructose (4.65- 6.79%), soluble pectin (4.40-7.29%) and soluble tannin (0.50-0.68%) per 100 g of ripe edible fruit. The fruit is rich in sugars (28.60 g), ascorbic acid (2.80 g), phenol (1.72 g), carotene (22.00 g) and ash (0.25 g) per 100 g of pulp. Ripe fruit is a very important source of fumaric acid and gallic acid. Importance and Uses 1. Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are the most important part of livelihood for local and tribal communities of India and act as their main source of income. According to the Tribal Co-operative Marketing Development Federation of India Ltd, GoI, 20-40% of annual income comes from the NTFPs to the tribal communities. Leaves of the tree are widely used for making excellent quality wrappers for tobacco beedi. It acts as an off-season source Ajay Kumar1*, Rakesh Jangid1, A K Gupta2, Nikhila Vaagdevi Anumala1, and Sudeshna Kharga1 Prospects Indian Horticulture 10 of income for tribal communities, especially women. 80% tendu leave collectors are women, enabling small-scale employment opportunities for women.
