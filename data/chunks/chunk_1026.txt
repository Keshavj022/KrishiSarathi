SUMMARY Sorghum has to face stiff competition by other cereals under better soils and rainfall where cash crops have replaced sorghum during kharif. However, the fact that sorghum being a C4 plant is a high biomass producer and relatively tolerant to several stress factors. This makes it difficult to be replaced in least endowed areas, especially in the climate change scenario.
