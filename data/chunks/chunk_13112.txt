  Spawning is undertaken by giving single injection of hormone like Ovatide@ 1ml/kg body weight to female, which becomes ready for stripping after 12 h when eggs come out easily from the vent.  The milt-suspension is prepared with extraction of the testes from the males and macerating these with normal saline solution.  The female fish is stripped and eggs are fertilized with milt-suspension and washed 3-4 times. A female lays around 12,000-14,000 adhesive eggs having diameter of 0.5 mm.  Eggs hatch in 20-22 h in the hatching jars/trough and measure 1.2-1.4 mm in total length. Yolk-sac gets absorbed within 72 h.  The hatchlings are reared @1000 nos/m2 in the larval rearing tanks and fed on live feed. With good husbandry, a survival of 50-60% is achieved at fry stage after 3-4 weeks of rearing.  The technology is largely confined to West Bengal. Compiled by: Dr S.K. Sahoo and Dr S.

It is a popular and moderate value catfish.  Breeds in running water during monsoon season. Successful captive breeding is achieved by raising healthy brooders in concrete tanks or earthen ponds and feeding them with pellet feed of 32-35% protein.  Brooders of 80-140 g are ideal for captive breeding. Sexes are separate. Males are identified by having long genital papilla, whereas females have bulged abdomen.  Females are induced with hormone injection such as Ovatide @ 1 ml/kg body weight and which become ready for spawning in 13-15 h. At that time, the abdomen of the selected male is cut-open, testes extracted and milt suspension is prepared in normal saline.  Eggs are stripped out and fertilized with milt suspension. Female of 80-140 g spawn around 12,000-14,000 free floating eggs of 1.3-1.4 mm diameter.  Eggs hatch after 20 h and free swimming larva measure 3.5-4.5 mm in total length. Larvae are reared at stocking density of 2 nos/litre and fed Artemia nauplii and mixed zooplankton. They grow to 50-60 mg in weight during 3-4 weeks of rearing.  The breeding technology is being extended in Odisha. 30 Yellow Catfish Horabagrus brachysoma (Günther, 1864)  Yellow catfish or Sun catfish is a medium sized catfish of food and ornamental importance and distributed only in Western Ghats of Kerala and Karnataka.  For captive breeding, the brooders are raised in earthen ponds or concrete tanks and fed with pellet feed containing 30% protein.  Sexes are separate.
