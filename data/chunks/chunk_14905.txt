The following commands that begin with (Boolean) denote two statements that are either True or False (1 or 0 in binary). The experimental set-up of the automated irrigation system is shown in Fig. 3. The "if" function is utilized in another portion of the program to present the statement of the auto-watering procedure. So, if one of the six cases between the OR gates is satisfied (true), then all other instances are also satisfied. Each case depends on two values from different sensors. Irrigation is enabled because the "if" function is met, resulting in the irrigation process being True. The Arduino, regarded as the system’s central processing unit (CPU), holds paramount signifi- cance among its components. The system’s logical functions are attrib- uted to it. The system is designed to fulfill two primary functions: automated irrigation and partial manual operation through the user’s mobile device. In order to operate, the Arduino necessitates a power supply of 5 V derived from the solar panel. The soil moisture sensors’ results range from 0 to 1023, representing a scale from severely wet to extremely dry conditions. Four unique soil moisture content values are provided for the same geographical area, each corresponding to a different location. Subsequently, the data is sent to Arduino, where it is compared against the predefined threshold values established by the user during the programming phase. Below is the threshold: The pump will be engaged if two sensors detect moisture levels over 800. The pump will cease operation once the moisture sensors indicate a reading below 400. If two of the four sensors register humidity readings surpassing 800, which signifies a state of dryness in the soil, the Arduino system is expected to activate the irrigation system autonomously. This activation will persist until all four sensors indicate humidity values below 400, indicating a state of wetness in the soil. Subsequently, the Arduino will exhibit a notification on the liquid crystal display (LCD) screen indicating the presence of moisture in the soil, thereby initiating the deactivation of the pump. If two out of four sensors detect humidity levels over 800, signifying an excessive dryness in the soil, the Arduino device is ex- pected to establish communication with the farmer via GSM SIM900. Subsequently, the farmer is responsible for initiating contact with the system to activate the water pump. The controller will trigger an auto- mated equipment shutdown if the four sensors register humidity read- ings below 400, indicating an elevated soil moisture level. 2.3.
