53 lakh machines were delivered to the farmers in the region. Of this 68,762 were delivered to Punjab farmers, 50,934 to Haryana farmers, 32,829 to Uttar Pradesh farmers and 54 to NCT Delhi farmers. For the benefit of small and marginal farmers, about 28,730 Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) were established in the region (19,301 in Punjab, 3,936 in Haryana, and 5,497 in Uttar Pradesh. 6 Ex-situ Crop Residue Management Options Out of about 3.0 million ha of total paddy area in Punjab there was 23.3% decline in the paddy area burnt in 2019 compared with 2017. Green House Gases (GHGs) and Particulate Matters (PMs) estimated to be emitted from paddy residue burning in the three states was reduced from 28 million tonne during 2017 (before the scheme period) to 23 million tonne (18.3 % less) during 2018 and to 19.7 million tonne (29.6% less) during 2019. Continuously adopting in-situ method of straw management will result in a saving of 30 to 35% Nitrogen; 20 to 25% Potassium and substantial amount of organic carbon, nearly 25% of irrigation water and further helps in restoring microbial activities in the soil. B. Decomposing using consortia of microbes developed by various Institutes This method is being tested for its effectiveness in decomposing the paddy straw residues in a short span of around 20 days before the next crops like wheat or vegetables are grown. 2. Ex-situ crop residue management Baling and transporting straw from the field, though appear to be an option for safe disposal, will be feasible only when alternate, effective and economically viable usage methods are identified and facilities and infrastructure for ex-situ management methods are created. The Secretary, DARE and Director General, ICAR constituted a committee of the following members for economic analysis of the alternative / ex-situ options of the crop residue management (a copy of the committee order is given in Annexure) : 1. Deputy Director General (Engg.), ICAR – Chairman 2. Representative of the Ministry of Power – Member 3. Representative of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas – Member 4. Representative of Joint Secretary (M&T), DAC&FW – Member 5. Dr. Suresh Pal, Director, ICAR – NIAP or his representative- Member 6. Director, ICAR – CIAE, Bhopal – Member 7. Dr. S. S. Sooch, Pr.
