Discussion Using the PSR model, this study provides a set of guidelines for the long-term viability of agriculture in the mainstream 14 agro- climatic regions of India. To aid in the long-term prosperity of Indian agriculture, this model helps policymakers pinpoint pressing sustainability issues and provides a wide range of policy recommendations. Comparing with other research, our study emphasizes the following. First, the PSR model allows for both quantitative and qualitative answers to be included in sustainability evaluation (Thomson et al., 2008; Qi et al., 2020). Second, the PSR model is helpful in achieving SDGs. Pressure, state, and response assessment indicators are developed using the SDGs as a reference. SDGs can be more effectively monitored and improved with the use of such an indicator system, which allows policymakers to keep a close eye on the sustainability performance of agricultural sector. The adaptable design of PSR-based framework allows users simply modify its parts to meet their own purposes of sustainability assessment. Changing the framework’s goals, indicators, and assessment models to ﬁt various agricultural sustainability initiatives is straight forward. Suresh et al.
