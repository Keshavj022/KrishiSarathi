Hybrid Rice Varieties recommended for Chhattisgarh under assured irrigated condition: Chhattisgarh Sankar dhan-2, Indira Sona, Suruchi, DRRH-2, Arize-6444, DRH-775, HRI-157, Ankur-74345, KPH-199, KPH-371, KRH-2, KRH-4, PAC-8744. Long duration varieties consume about 15-20% more water and are susceptible to different pathotypes and insects resulting less profit.   Timely sowing of nursery should be followed from 01 to 20th June and timely transplanting (up to 20th July) schedule for better grain quality, water saving and low build up of stem borers. For higher yield transplant 15to 25 days old seedlings before 20th July.   Use laser land leveller for precise land levelling to enhance efficiency of water and other farm inputs. Apply nutrients according to the soil test results. Omit phosphorus application in rice following wheat that received recommended dose of phosphatic fertilizers. Use nitrogen judiciously based on leaf colour chart (LCC). Excessive use of nitrogen encourages multiplication of insect pests and diseases .   To control Zinc deficiency, apply 60 kg of Zinc sulphate heptahydrate (21%) or 40 kg Zinc sulphate monohydrate (33%) per hectare at puddling in case previous crop in this field had shown the symptoms of Zinc deficiency. Direct Seeded Rice (Unnat Khurra Boni)   Direct seeded rice method with Seed drill gives better yield in rainfed ecosystem of Chhattisgarh and minimize the losses occur due to drought spells and uneven distribution of rainfall or moisture stress situation. DSR will also help in timely sowing, labour saving, hence farmers of Chhattisgarh are advised to adopt this technique and bring rice area under direct seeding.   Sowing should be done in the second fortnight of June and Indira Barani Dhan-1 is the most suitable variety. Sowing should be completed with rice seed drill fitted with inclined plate seed planter by using 20 to 25 kg seed /ha in 20 cm spaced rows. The seed should be placed at 2-3 cm depth.
