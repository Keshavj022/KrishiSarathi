 By improving the soil conditions for water movement and also increasing drain water discharges, the performance of deep drainage systems improved. The main causes of the rise in water table are precipitation, excess irrigation, leaching water, seeps from higher land or irrigation canal and ditches and groundwater under artesian pressure that reduced by subsurface close drainage technology by removing excess groundwater from the crop root zone system which promotes safe environment for efficient crop growth that reflect on higher crop yield. Reduction in Soil Salinity due to Closed Sub-Surface Drainage System There was considerable reduction in soil salinity. Graph was drawn to observe the changes in ECe before and after the installation of the system (Fig. 5). Overall effect was positive and three years after installation, ECe has been reduced. Before the installation of drainage systems, ECe ranged from 6.3 to 7.1 (average: 6.7 dSm-1) and after installation of drainage systems, it was observed 3.2 to 3.8 (average: 3.5 dSm-1), respectively. The upper layers are reclaimed at a faster rate than the deeper layers. Within three years after installation of drainage systems, sub surface drainage technology can also be effectively used in the saline and sodic soils to remove the salts in huge quantities from the profile in shortest possible time. Establishment of sugarcane crop was good after installation of drains and general yield increase was 55 to 75%. Conclusion Adoption of sub-surface drainage system was found highly effective in reclamation of water logged and salt affected lands. Water table and ECe of soils were improved by 52.2 and 36.9%, respectively. Ultimately, sugarcane crop yield increased by 65.5%.
