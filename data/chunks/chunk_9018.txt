3 16.1 16.2 16.1 (tonnes/ha) polycover, with variation in date of sowing. It was found that irrespective of date of sowing, the tomato nursery raised under polyhouse compared with other two methods, had early emergence, highest number of transplants per unit area, and early fruit harvest. Similar trial was also conducted on chilli and it was found that irrespective of date of sowing, chilli raised under polyhouse when compared with other two methods, was early by 25-55 days, with highest number of transplant per unit area and early fruit yield. Performance of zero-till-seed-cum-fertilizer drill: The results of zero-till-seed- cum-fertilizer drill are given below. Increased yield. Zero-tillage trials were conducted by a number of KVKs with the objective to make the farmers aware of the use of zero-till-seed-cum-fertilizer- drill for sowing of wheat early and to reduce the expenditure on land preparation.

Reduced weed population. The trials conducted in Kurukshetra district of Haryana indicated that sowing with zero-tillage drill reduced the population of Phalaris minor in wheat ranging from 21.1 to 35.1% compared to broadcasting. The decrease in population of weed was lower under late sown conditions (21% during 1999-2000). In Panipat district of Haryana, the reduction of weed was 31.6% under zero-tillage seed drill. Wheareas in Ferozepur and Kapurthala, the reduction in weed population was 60.0 and 86.2% less respectively under zero-tillage as compared to conventional method. Impact of frontline demonstrations on oilseeds: The KVK, Tikamgarh, Madhya Pradesh, conducted frontline demonstrations on mustard since 1991-92. The demonstration yield varied from 1.22 tonnes/ha in 1997-98 to 1.77 tonnes/ha in 2000-01.
