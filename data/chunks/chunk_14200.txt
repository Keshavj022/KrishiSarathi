 To ensure robust validation, we compared the datasets using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (CC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Kendall’s tau, presenting the re- sults in spatial distributions and boxplots (Fig. 6). The results from Fig. 6 demonstrate a strong agreement between the datasets. For the ESACCI versus ERA5-Land SM comparison, the CC values across most of the grid points are consistently above 0.8 (Fig. 6a, d), indicating a strong positive correlation. The RMSE values are less than 0.2 across all grids (Fig. 6b, e), reflecting low error magnitudes between the datasets. Additionally, the Kendall’s tau values are above 0.6 (Fig. 6c, f), suggesting a signifi- cant concordance in the rankings of SM values between the two datasets. Fig. 4.

Pal International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation 134 (2024) 104175 5 Similarly, the comparison between the ESACCI and GLDAS SM datasets shows even stronger agreement. The CC values are above 0.85 across all grids (Fig. 6g, j), further underscoring the strong correlation. The RMSE values are less than 0.05 (Fig. 6h, k), indicating minimal differences between the datasets. Kendall’s tau values are consistently above 0.65 (Fig. 6i, l), signifying robust agreement in the relative rankings of SM values between ESACCI and GLDAS SM datasets. These results collectively suggest that the ESACCI SM dataset is well-aligned with both ERA5-Land and GLDAS SM data, supporting its reliability in regions where direct ground measurements are unavailable. 4.2. Spatiotemporal distribution of SSMI and ESSMI The spatially averaged SSMI and ESSMI are compared with two established and widely used indices SPI and SPEI, to evaluate and verify the efficiency of satellite SM indices for agricultural drought charac- terization. The spatially averaged values of all four indices are calcu- lated at the annual scale (Fig. 7a) in SPH for the period of 1991 to 2020 and a few monthly scale instances are presented in Fig. 7b–c. The pos- itive/negative values of all four indices represent wet/dry conditions. It is observed from Fig. 7a that the annual variations of all four indices are in sync with each other from 1991 to 2020. The SSMI and ESSMI values represent the years 1991–1997, 2001–2004, 2009, 2012, 2014–2018 as drought years and 1998–2000, 2005–2007, 2008, 2010–2011, 2013, 2019–2020 as wet years. This pattern is almost agreed by SPI and SPEI except for a few cases (years) such as 1991, 1993, 1996, 2006 and 2013. None of the years during the study period experienced severe or extreme wet/dry conditions as identified by the drought indices, experiencing only near normal and mild to moderate events shown by all four indices.
