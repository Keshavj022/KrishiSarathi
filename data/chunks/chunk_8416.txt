 Identification of training need/skill deficient areas For the first time in ICAR, training need/skill deficiency of all categories of employees was undertaken at the Institutes. Almost all Institutes have identified the training areas/skill deficiency for different categories of employees and identified 128 training areas for scientists, 87 for technical, 49 for administrative personnel and 36 for skilled-supporting staff. This first time exercise has paved the way for further designing and developing the new training programmes. Development of Annual Training Plan (ATP) based on training needs Developing Annual Training Plan (ATP) based on training need assessment is necessary as per National Training Policy-2012 of Government of India.
