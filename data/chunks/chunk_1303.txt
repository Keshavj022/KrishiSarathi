 The kitchen gardening component, although limited to a 36 m² area, generated modest net returns. Nevertheless, this subsystem enhanced food security and contributed to the sustainability of the IFS by providing additional produce for household consumption or local sale. Farmer 1 achieved the highest total net returns (`1,24,056), underscoring a well-integrated and profitable farming system, closely followed by Farmer 5 (`1,20,438) and Farmer 6 (`1,10,038). Farmer 2 had the lowest total net returns (` 86,555), suggesting potential inefficiencies or higher production costs. The observed variability in profitability across farmers may be attributed to distinct agronomic practices, input costs, and enterprise selection within each farming system. Integrated farming system model for farms An economic analysis of various enterprises within Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) across six distinct farms is given in Table 2. Each farm included multiple agricultural components, such as cropping systems, vegetable production, livestock, vermicomposting, and seed production (Berseem), along with supplementary activities like mushroom production, beekeeping, and pig farming. The area considered for these enterprises is referred to as the gross cropped area, which includes the total land dedicated to crops on a farm, accounting for multiple cropping cycles within a year. This area encompasses land used for crops grown in different seasons (rabi, kharif, and zaid) and reflects the overall agricultural activity and land-use efficiency. Farm 1, with a gross cropped area of 19.24 ha, generated total gross returns of `3,370,820 and net returns of `1,918,765, primarily from its cropping and livestock enterprises. In terms of crop cultivation, Farm 1 dedicated 6.8 ha to wheat, 8.0 ha to paddy, 1.6 ha to maize, 1.6 ha to mustard, and 0.08 ha to turmeric. Vegetable production on this farm included cucumber, bitter gourd, brinjal, and chilli. Additionally, Farm 1 produced vermicompost with one unit and maintained a nutrition garden spanning 0.05 ha for fruit crops. The livestock component included three buffaloes and one cow, further contributing to the farm’s income. Farm 2, the largest at 26.4 ha of gross cropped area, recorded the highest gross return of `6,022,277 and a net return of `3,727,606, with livestock as the main source of income. Farm 2 allocated 8.0 ha for wheat, 12.0 ha for paddy, 3.6 ha for maize, 2.0 ha for potato, 0.4 ha for sugarcane, 0.2 ha for moong, and 0.2 ha for sarson. For vegetable production, Farm 2 cultivated chilli on 0.2 ha, turmeric on 0.04 ha, and onion and garlic on 0.08 ha. The farm also engaged in vermicomposting with two units and had five cattle in its livestock enterprise. Farm 3, covering 9.4 ha, demonstrated a balanced integration of enterprises, yielding total gross returns of ` 1,800,354 and net returns of ` 1,033,438. Farm 3 focuses on wheat cultivation, with 3.2 ha dedicated to wheat, 4.8 ha to paddy, 1.2 ha to maize, and 0.
