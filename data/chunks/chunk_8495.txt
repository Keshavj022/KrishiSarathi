79 tonne breeder seed of 7 varieties has been produced against the DAC indent of 0.24 tonne. Fertilizers at 40 kgN/ha + 40 kg P/ha gave maximum seed yield when phosphorus was supplied half as DAP/SSP + half as rock-phosphate, enriched with FYM. Sulphur at 20 kg/ha with recommended dose of fertilizers gave maximum yield. Niger + Frenchbean (4 : 2) with 20-cm row spacing at Semiliguda, niger + castor (2 : 2) at Chhindwara and niger+ricebean (2 : 4) at Igatpuri were most remunerative intercropping systems. In niger, component technology such as adoption of improved variety (34.0– 57.1%), improved variety+biofertilizer (41–137%), recommended dose of fertilizers (37.7–107.6%), intercropping (37%), sowing method (47.3%) and time of sowing (246–294%) enhanced productivity on the farmers’ fields. LINSEED Crop Improvement Four varieties have been identified/released for cultivation. Out of 200 germplasm screened at hot spots, ES 1465, ES 1496, ES 1329, ES 131-10, FRW 6, GLC 1-1, GS 15, GS 53, GS 85, GS 157, GS 158, GS 234, GS 252, GS 270, GS 208 have showed resistance to powdery mildew and GS 148, GS 165 and GS 202 against rust diseases. l In niger, component technology enhanced its productivity in farmers’ fields. l Linseed lines A 95b, EC 1392, EC 1424, GS 234 and JRF 5 proved promising against bud-fly. l In rainfed areas of Sagar, in linseed + safflower (4 : 2), 100% RDF to main crop and 50% to intercrop recorded highest linseed equivalent yield.
