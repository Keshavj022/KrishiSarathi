 Germplasm resistant to Turcicum leaf blight (TLB), downy mildew, and bacterial leaf and sheath blight were also developed and distributed to the national maize program. Conservation agriculture based sustainable intensification practices promoted by CIMMYT have achieved large scale adoption; these include zero tillage, direct seeded rice, precision land levelling, residue management, precision input management and mechanization and climate smart agriculture (CSA). Since 1969, more than 360 Indian visiting scientists and nearly 90 trainees have been hosted at CIMMYT. Between 1969 and 2019, more than 2,500 Indian scientists improved their knowledge and skills through various capacity building activities with CIMMYT. A short (2 weeks) advance international course on conservation agriculture was introduced in India in year 2010. Since 2017, a long term (10 months) training of wheat breeders/pathologists at Mexico (for wheat breeding) and Bolivia (for wheat Blast research), has been introduced. The progress of work plan activities implemented during the year 2019-20 have been summarized below: International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) ICAR-CGIAR | ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 46 Bread wheat improvement The project focuses on breeding and testing of more productive wheat germplasm that combines a range of other necessary traits to enhance productivity and acceptance to farmers, industry and consumers. The major results are given below: yy Eight varieties of diverse parentage selected from previous international trials and nurseries were either identified or released for cultivation by national partners in 2019.

Multisite yield performance in India identified superior yielding, rust resistant lines for further testing. By seed multiplication and preparation of new international trials and nurseries a total of 195 sets provided to partners in India for growing in current season 2019-20 (Fig. 6). About 60% and 80% lines in the trials and nurseries had high to adequate resistance to Ug99 race group and yellow rust races present in India, respectively.
