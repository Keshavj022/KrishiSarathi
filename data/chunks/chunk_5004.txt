PEST AND DISEASE MANGEMENT (hing) and Vitex negundo are given in Annexures II and III. The effect of this pesticide in controlling the insect pest of wheat over a period of time is given below: On first day after spray All aphids and armyworm larvae were killed with monocrotophos spray. But the number of these insects significantly declined after treatment with cow urine and its mixing with different herbal pesticides. On tenth day after spray The number of aphids increased under control conditions and significantly declined under treated conditions. Same pattern was observed in Fig. 1. Efficacy of different insecticidal sprays against wheat aphid Fig. 2. Effectiveness of different insecticidal treatments against larvae of armyworm case of number of armyworm larvae and number of infested plants per plot.The total control of wheat aphid was observed with monocrotophos. On twentieth day after spray The increase in the number of aphids showed an interesting phenomenon. Here the population of aphids significantly increased to maximum number besides insecticidal treatment and also in the control. The infestation ratio in plant was maximum at this stage. Such an increase in population can be attributed to migration and peculiar reproduction pattern of the aphids On thirtieth day after spray The number of aphids increased only under control condition. The population of aphids and armyworm significantly declined with all other insecticidal formulations used. Total eradication of wheat aphids took place with monocrotophos treatment. On fortieth day after spray The number of aphids marginally decreased in control conditions but there was significant decline in the number of aphids with different herbal and chemical insecticidal treatments used.
