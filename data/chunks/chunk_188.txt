 Afterwards, powdered dolomite is applied (at the rate of 100 g per m2 pond area) as a liming material to correct acidity and enhance phosphorus and carbon content, promoting higher phytoplankton production. Following this, the ponds are filled with water using a pump through a 200-micron mesh screen to prevent the entry of unwanted fish or fish eggs. Pond fertilization involves the application of dried cow dung (4 kg/cent), groundnut cake (300 g/cent), and urea (50 g/cent). To induce consistent production of phytoplankton bloom in ponds, it is essential to apply fermented liquid extract of oil Sardine and Jaggery at the rate of 1 ml/m2 of pond area an at interval of 15 days. Creating breeding environment In one acre pond, 400 sufficiently mature pearlspot brood fish each approximately weighing 100-150 g and 100-200 mm length need to be deposited. Ensuring proper nutrition, a formulated feed with 40% protein and 8% fat in the form of 3 mm floating pellets is advised. The feeding regimen should be carried out during both dawn and dusk to meet the dietary needs of the brood fish. This strategic approach aims to enhance the health and reproductive capabilities of the pearlspot brood fish, contributing to a thriving aquaculture environment in the one-acre pond. Pearlspot brooders show a preference for stationary solid objects for egg-laying, particularly those near the bunds. Therefore, the installation of mud tiles, each approximately 400 mm in length and 150 mm in width, and wooden poles measuring 1 m in length, made of materials such as bamboo and casuarina, is recommended. These structures should be erected vertically on the pond bottom in a line, maintaining a constant distance of 1 m from the sidewalls of the ponds. It is advisable to keep a pole-to-pole distance of 2 m to facilitate brooders in affixing their eggs. Breeding and egg hatching Pearlspots exhibit year-round breeding tendencies, with peak breeding periods observed from February to May and October to December. The pearlspot brood fishes move in pairs around the sides of the ponds approximately seven days after stocking. The brood fish’s kissing behaviour and jumping movements around the bamboo poles are indications of egg-laying. Together, the pair clean the bamboo substrate using their mouths and subsequently lay eggs. Eggs undergo a continuous colour transformation as they advance towards hatching stage. Soon after fertilization, the egg’s colour will be yellow, which changes to brown, dark brown, and eventually black. Approximately 90-96 hours of incubation is necessary for the eggs to hatch. From a single batch of eggs, an average of 900 to 950 fries can hatch out, resulting in an average hatching percentage of approximately 80-85. For the first two days, no external feed is necessary for the fries, which are around 800±40 µm in size, due to the presence of a sufficient yolk sac.
