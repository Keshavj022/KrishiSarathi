 Hence, JAC holds immense potential as a new indigenous product under the banner of ‘Make in India’ and may help the Indian food testing laboratories to perform food analysis at a lower cost, leading towards the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat.’ Eco-friendly sustainable extraction of keratin from animal hair: India has the 3rd largest sheep population in the world having 74.26 million sheep, producing 36.93 million kg wool. Out of this about 85% is carpet grade wool, 5% apparel grade and remaining 10% is coarser grade wool (2020–21) not suitable for textile application. Wool contains about 95% keratins which have huge applications in medical and pharmaceutical industries. Coarser grade wool having Uncoated Coated Banana Pseudostem for Paper and Functional Textile The banana pseudostem has potential for extraction of textile fibres, sap for dyeing and finishing, and other portion for making paper-based products. Semi-solid banana plant biomass was used for making paperboard, similar to paper with higher areal density comparable with conventional handmade paper. Thickness of banana paperboard (0.8 mm) was lower than jute paperboard (1.4 mm). Tenacity and puncture load of banana paperboards (2.6 cN/tex, 199 N) were higher than the jute-fibre paperboards (1.4 cN/tex, 165 N). The banana paper board was used for making disposable moulded cutlery items, e.g. bowl (weight 3.5 g), plate (17 g) and thali (32 g). The sap of banana pseudostem was used as a bio-mordant for dyeing jute fabric and they showed better colour strength (K/S of 4.8) than only dyed sample (K/S of 1.5) with satisfactory colour fastness to rubbing and light. Bowl and plate made from banana plant paperboard Post-harvest Management and Value-addition icar annual report 2022-23 138 no textile use can be used for extraction of keratin. ICAR-NINFET, Kolkata, West Bengal has developed a microbial protocol for keratin extraction from animal hair using a keratinolytic bacterial culture AR31 which was isolated from poultry waste by serial dilution technique. The isolate resulted in about 54% dissolution of coarse wool when incubated at a suitable temperature and pH. Dissolution of wool takes 6–8 days, after which the liquid is centrifuged to get a clear supernatant from which keratin is precipitated with organic solvent (40– 45% yield) with a cost of about ₹2,000/kg keratin. Manufacture of high value products from nettle fibre and its blends: Fibre producing species of nettle are European nettle (Celtis australis) and Himalayan nettle (Girardinia diversifolia). The Himalayan nettle plant is abundantly available in India. It grows wild at an altitude of 1,200-2,900 m amsl in the hills of Himalayan region. ICAR-NINFET, Kolkata, West Bengal has developed 100% nettle, nettle/viscose (75:25, 50:50,25:75), and nettle/polyester (75:25, 50:50, 25:75) blended yarn and also union fabrics using cotton yarn in warp and these nettle based yarns in the weft.
