When population was less, single crop in a season with grazing animals and least use of machines and material inputs was a reality rather than exception. As we grew in numbers and in ambitions, the intensive use of man, machine and material started with less use of animals. The man-to-man interface, structured or unstructured, played a catalytic role in this evolution of agriculture. The agricultural extension system in India evolved through phases. Firstly, it helped in the intensive use of inputs and dwarf varieties of rice and wheat, hybrids of maize and other coarse cereals for food security. The community development programme in 1950s, intensive area development programme, T&V programme, lab to land programme in 1970s and oilseeds & pulses promotional programme in 1980s, micro-irrigation and farm mechanizations 1990s onwards and more intensively post MGNREGA are the critical endeavors done by the agricultural extension system in the past that shaped todayâ€™s technology and skill intensive agriculture. Agricultural extension helped reducing the gaps in potential yields and farm realized yields.
