Lastly, the environmental component underlines the significance of water quality, crucial for effective irrigation. Challenges like high pH levels in irrigation water and varying fertilizer usage patterns can impede proper water solubilization and crop growth. In summary, the negative correlation between resources and use might be attributed to overdependence on single irrigation source, inadequate infrastructure, knowledge, and challenges related to water quality and farming practices. Addressing these aspects through edu­ cation, technology adoption, and improved water management strate­ gies is vital for maximizing water utilization and agricultural productivity. Discussion In this discussion, we delve into the sub-indicators that emerge from our analysis, shedding light on the capacity components. Each sub- indicator offers a perspective on the factors influencing water manage­ ment and agricultural practices in the study area as given below. • Watering Efficiency and Infrastructure: Insufficient watering dura­ tion due to power issues underscores the need for reliable three- phase power and proper infrastructure. Initiatives like subsidized solar park pumps can enhance watering efficiency. • High-Pressure Irrigation Pumps: Adequate horsepower in irrigation pumps, especially for water-intensive crops like sugar cane, is vital for meeting irrigation needs, particularly for large land holdings. • Diversification for Extra Income: Encouraging non-agricultural employment and small-scale businesses on farms can diversify in­ come sources, reducing livelihood vulnerability. • Community Training and Participation: Empowering the economi­ cally active population through training and encouraging participa­ tion in water management activities is essential for sustainable practices.
