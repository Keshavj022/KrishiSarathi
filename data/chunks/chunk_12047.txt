 Application of Bio-Pulse could reduce the wilt incidence by 40- 75% in chickpea, 30-55% in lentil, 45-60% in pea, 25-40% in pigeonpea, and 60-75% damping off/seedling mortality in papaya under different agroclimatic condition depending upon soil type and crop species. Application of Bio-Pulse as seed biopriming with recommended dose of fertilizer resulted in yield increase in chickpea (15-25%), pea (20-30%), lentil (10-20%) and papaya (25-42%) under different pathogenic stress as compared to pathogen challenged condition. 6.

Name of technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/species): BioCompost is a carrier based formulation of consortium of four lignocellulolytic fungi namely Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trichoderma viride, Aspergillus awamori and Pleurotus florida. 2. Target crops and delivery system: Agricultural residue of almost all field crops like wheat, rice, mustard, maize, and soybean can be converted into mature compost within 65- 70 days by pit or windrow methods. Each windrow is prepared using straw mix (substrates for composting) + Cow dung + good quality soil + old compost in the ratio of 8 : 1 : 0.5 : 0.5 (For preparing 1 ton of compost: 800 kg substrate + 100 kg fresh cowdung or poultry droppings + 50 kg soil + 50 kg old compost has to be mixed). In case, P enriched compost is to be prepared, Rock phosphate @1% is also added as a source of insoluble P. At all times, 65 -70 % moisture is maintained in the biomass. The piles containing raw material needs to be turned after every 15 days. By this process N (1-1.5%) and P (0.3-0.5%) enriched compost can be prepared from diverse crop residues within 70-75 days. 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): For plains. 4. Validation and commercialization: Eight villages were covered in the districts of Mau and Azamgarh of Eastern Uttar Pradesh since the technology underwent spread under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna project sponsored by Govt. of Uttar Pradesh. The windrow composting technology has been disseminated among more than 1000 farmers in >24 villages of Mau and Azamgarh districts. 5. Benefits: The application of nutrient enriched compost in soil leads to a significant increase in the soil fertility status, in terms of microbial biomass, N and available P, enhancing the overall physical, chemical and biological health of soil. The Cost: Benefit ratio is 1:3 taking Rs 6/ per kg as the minimum sale price. The technology is very much suitable for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and will help to improve rural sanitation. 6.
