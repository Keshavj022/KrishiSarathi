 Root growth not only increases the mineral uptake but also increases the mineral content of the sprout from day 4 and evidently more as the nutrient solution is used instead of water. The sprouts are the most enzyme- rich plants and maintain the highest level from germination to 7 days of age. They are rich in antioxidants, especially carotene. Uses/potential benefits  Hydroponic technology is eco- friendly.  The hydroponic system allows growing green fodder at a wider temperature (15–32°C) and humidity range (80–85%) without fungal growth.  Hydroponically grown fodder is highly nutritious and free from contamination.  It saves water and labour cost.  The green fodder from the hydroponic system improves animal/livestock health and reproductive efficiency. Precautions for cultivation  The seeds should be procured from a certified organization to be used for cultivation.  Seeds treated with pesticides and fungicides should not be Hydroponic maize fodder after 7 days Source: http://vadic.vigyanashram.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day-7-1024 x 577.jpg Hydroponic green fodder production Source: Feedipedia Low-scale hydroponic fodder unit Source: https://agricultureguruji.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Hydroponic- fodder-system.jpg Indian Farming 5 February 2023 used for cultivation as any residue may adversely affect the health of animals.  The water should be replaced at every 3 days to reduce microbial contamination.  The green shed net is important for aeration and lighting to prevent yellowing of the leave because the green shade net allows sufficient light and maintains favourable temperature and humidity for optimum photosynthesis which results in a better yield of hydroponic fodder. Economic benefit As compared to the conventional forage production system, hydroponic fodder production is an economically feasible method Table 1.
