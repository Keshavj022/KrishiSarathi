 Spraying the gerbera plants with copper oxychloride (0.03%) followed by Mancozeb (0.02%) was found superior than other fungicides in reducing the leaf spot/blight disease in gerbera under Kahikuchi conditions. • For the control of foot rot/root rot disease of gerbera, the treatment of plants with Benomyl (0.01 %) + Captan (0.02%) followed by Benomyl (0.01%) and Trichoderma viride (20 g/m2) was found to be very effective under Pune agro‐climatic conditions. • Foliar application of Difencanozole (0.05%) and Panchanozole(0.05%) controlled the disease effectively under Pune conditions. • During 2004‐05, four new crops were included. About five cultivars of tulip were collected, maintained and evaluated at Srinagar, Solan and Katrain. In daffodils, five cultivars were maintained at Katrain , Srinagar and Solan. 17 varieties of Lilium were collected, maintained and evaluated at Solan, Srinagar and Katrain. In alstroemeria, 15 varieties were maintained at four centres viz., Kalimpong, Srinagar, Katrain and Solan www.icar.org.in 8 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Horticulture All India Coordinated Research Project on Potato 1.

Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years): New varieties Six hybrids following multilocation testing under AICRP (Potato) were recommended for release as new potato varieties for different regions/purposes. Salient features of these hybrids under new varietal names are given below: Hybrid Variety name Salient features Areas of adaptability JW‐160 Kufri Pushkar (2003) High yielding medium maturing hybrid having field resistance to late blight and excellent keeping quality Plains and plateau regions of the country MS/92‐2105 Kufri Arun (2003) A red skinned high yielding hybrid having field resistance to late blight Indo‐Gangetic plains SM/87‐185 Kufri Shailja (2003) A late blight resistant hybrid having higher tuber dry matter and better keeping quality Hilly regions of the country HT/92‐621 Kufri Surya (2005) A heat tolerant hybrid suitable for early planting conditions and having high dry matter is also suitable for processing into French fries Northern plains and warmer areas of the country. MP/97‐583 Kufri Chipsona‐3 (2005) Produces high yield, high tuber dry matter and excellent chip color. It produces more processable grade tubers and acceptable quality chips after storage at 10‐12°C upto 180 days. Indo‐Gangetic plains, Kota and Indore region SM/91‐1515 Kufri Himalini (2005) Better resistance to late blight than all available varieties, good tuber shape and no tuber cracking.
