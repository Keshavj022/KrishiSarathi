 Equipment handling and maintenance • Selection of incubators: Choose reliable, energy- efficient incubators suited to your egg types and capacity. Consider both setter and hatcher units, or combined units, based on your needs. • Regular calibration: Calibrate incubators and other equipment according to the manufacturer’s specifications. This ensures accurate temperature and humidity control. • Cleaning and disinfection: Regularly clean and disinfect incubators, hatcher units, and all associated equipment to prevent contamination and disease spread. • Maintenance schedule: Implement a routine maintenance schedule to inspect and repair equipment. This includes checking for wear and tear, and ensuring all parts are functioning properly.

Ensure eggs are collected, stored, and handled properly to maintain fertility and hatchability. • Temperature and humidity: Maintain optimal temperature and humidity levels as recommended by the incubator manufacturer. Regularly monitor these conditions to prevent deviations. • Turning of eggs: Ensure eggs are turned regularly, either manually or automatically, to promote even embryo development. Avoid turning eggs during the last three days of incubation. Biosecurity and health management • Biosecurity measures: Implement strict biosecurity practices to prevent disease introduction. This includes sanitizing footwear, equipment, and hands before entering the hatchery. • Health monitoring: Regularly monitor the health of both the eggs and newly hatched chicks. Look for signs of disease or abnormalities and take corrective actions promptly. • Vaccination: Follow a vaccination schedule for chicks to prevent common poultry diseases. Ensure vaccinations are administered correctly and at the recommended ages.
