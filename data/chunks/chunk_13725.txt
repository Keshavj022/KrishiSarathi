With the exception of 180 DAS in the winter wheat crop, weed control and tillage treatments signiﬁcantly (p = 0.05) varied TWD. 3.2. Phyto-sociology of summer season weeds According to Concenço et al. (2017), phyto-sociology of weeds reveals a pattern of variation in plant populations within a crop, and these changes are related to production techniques. This Table 3 The impact of weed management practices and tillage on the number of weeds per square meter in a wheat crop (pooled data).

ZT-ZT, zero tillage in maize and wheat; ZT-ZTR, zero tillage + residue retention in maize and wheat crops; CT-ZT, conventional tillage in maize followed by zero tillage in wheat; CT-ZTR, zero tillage + residue retention in maize and wheat crops; Herbicides for maize and wheat crops are advised by H-H; Integrated weed management for maize and wheat crops (IWM-IWM); in maize and wheat crops, HW-HW, hand weeding.

A highly important value index would be present in the dom- inating weed species. Important value index (IVI) has been given for ﬁfteen tillage and weed management treatment combinations (Table 4). A total of eight weed species, which have annual type of life span, were identiﬁed in the experimental area.
