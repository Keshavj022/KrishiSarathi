 Sub-surface drip fertigation system in maize-wheat system ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 67 CROP MANAGEMENT or 4 splits for water productivity. Applying 50% RDK in 4 splits was significantly superior to 100% RDK applied without drip under CA under CT. Designing biointensive cropping system for profit maximization and environmental sustainability: Legume integration with cereal proves superiority over other combinations. Temporal integration of maize + blackgram (raised bed) + soybean (furrow)-chickpea (raised bed) + wheat (furrow) (3:2)-greengram (raised bed) + sunflower (furrow) (5:1) was found economically feasible by recording higher productive efficiency (175%) concerning maize-wheat systems with the lowest greenhouse gases intensity (GHGI). Starch debranching enzyme pullulanase assay indicated the role of linear amylopectin chain in crystallized RS formation within the grains. This is probably the first report on the natural presence of high RS (crystallized) in rice (IG 23) with lower AC exhibited low GI value (52.49). Chilli and turmeric as promising alternate crops to tobacco in Andhra Pradesh: Among different crops/ cropping systems studied system productivity in terms of tobacco leaf equivalent yield (TLEY) was high in chilli (2,416 kg/ha) followed by turmeric (2,172 kg/ha) compared to fallow-tobacco (1,645 kg/ha) and other Development of economically efficient and environmentally robust Integrated Farming System model An IFS model (1-acre area) comprises polyhouse cultivation of vegetables (600 m2 area for cultivation of tomato, capsicum, and cucumbers), mushroom production (50 m2 area), agri-horti system (1,200 m2 area), apiculture and open field cultivation of vegetables, flowers, cereals, oilseeds and pulses on 2,200 m2 area was for small and marginal farmers developed. The IFS model is economically efficient and environmentally robust and has the potential to generate a net income of I 1,75,650 per year. Integrated farming system model Designing biointensive cropping systems Selected rice genotypes with contrasting GI values and variable AC and RS Rice genotypes Glycemic index Amylose content (%) Resistant starch (%) IG 40 (Kohila) 56.00 24.52 1.89 IG 23 (Shamjira) 52.49 15.65 2.28 IG 72 (UPR 3506-7-1-1) 63.00 12.25 0.64 Identification of determinant for low glycemic index rice: Generally, rice with high amylose content (AC) exhibits slower starch digestion resulting in slow rise of postprandial blood glucose level. In addition to AC, linear chains of amylopectin also affect the rate of starch digestibility. The values of glycemic index (52.49-63.0), resistant starch (RS) (0.64%-2.28%) and AC (3.82-24.52%) were found to vary widely in 110 rice genotypes. Genotypes IG 23 and IG 40 with contrasting AC revealed that amylose alone did not affect digestion rate. Starch morphology, bio-accessibility and pasting properties differed noticeably between the genotypes. ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 68 CROP MANAGEMENT tobacco based cropping systems.
