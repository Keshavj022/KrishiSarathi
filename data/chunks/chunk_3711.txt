This system minimizes the water losses in the conventional irrigation methods such as deep percolation, runoff and evaporation. General tentative water requirement of greenhouse crops Name of the crop Water requirement in lit/day/sqm Roses 5 to 7 Gerbera 4 to 6 Carnation 4 to 6 Capsicum 5 to 7 Tomatoes 5 to 7 Fogging and misting system: Fogging systems are fairly effective and uniform methods of greenhouse cooling that provide a reasonable increase in relative humidity in a greenhouse. Foggers are connected to lateral with micro-tube and it is hanging over iron wire in green house (3m above). Misters are attached on Stake in beds. Fogger and misters produce very small droplets (about 70 micron) of water in the air and evaporated before falling onto the crop canopy. Foggers and misters are equipped with an anti-leak device which does not allow flow of water droplets to fall down after the system is switched off. Foggers/Misters have low discharge rate with smaller area coverage. The operating pressure of fogger/ mister is varying in between 3.0 kg/cm2 to 5.5 kg/cm2. Generally, the time of operation of foggers and misters is 0.30 sec. to 60 sec. three to four times in an hour at some specific time interval. The frequency of fogging/misting depends upon the temperature and humidity inside the green house. Generally, foggers and misters are used more frequently in summers as compared to winters.
