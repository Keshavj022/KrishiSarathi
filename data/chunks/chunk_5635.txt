This practice helps in conserving soil moisture, minimizing the soil loss and weed and pest populations (Nanaj, North Sholapur, Maharashtra). Anonymous (2000d) 2 Harrowing for soil and moisture conservation Harrowing with bullock-drawn harrow is done in ploughed lands after loosening of clods. The depth of the harrowing varies from 8 to 10 cm with width of 60 to 75 cm. This practice helps to remove weeds, attain proper seed bed condition and also conserve rain water in soil (Sholapur, Maharashtra). Anonymous (2000d) 3 Tillage across the slopes to reduce runoff The farmers in Bijapur and Bhagalkot of Karnataka do ploughing as part of land preparation activity across the slopes to form preparation activity across the slopes to form miniature barrier for reducing the velocity of runoff water. It provides more opportunity time for rainwater to infiltrate into the vertisols. Above 28â€“30% increase yield of rabi sorghum and sunflower was observed by the farmers as compared to cultivation along the slopes (Bijapur and Bhagalkot, Karnataka). Anonymous (1999b) 4 Submergence bundh for run off harvesting In this system water is impounded in heavy black soils by constructing big dykes at lower elements of the slope. The soils are generally medium to deep with 1 to 3% slope. The height of the dyke could be 2 to 5 m with 10 to 12 m base and 1.5 to 2.0 m top dimension, slope being 1.5:1. These bunds could be 2 to 3 m long and at 2 to 4 m vertical interval. These will help in ground water recharge. Such a system is called haveli or bundh. These bundhs are put to permanent vegetation like Acacia nilotica (Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh). Dhruvanarayana (1993) 1 INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE S. No.
