 Variations in parboiling conditions yield rice with differing physical qualities, which may affect consumer preference. The summary of the parboiled rice processing condition variation can be seen in Figure 1. Table 1 provides a brief comparison of the parboiling processes reported earlier. A comparison of rice parboiling methods with respect the soaking and steaming steps is set out below. Agriculture 2023, 13, 1390 3 of 24 Figure 1. Summary of parboiled rice production. Table 1. A comparison of several parboiling methods. Process Beneﬁts Disadvantages Reference 1. The single-batch boiling process Soaking at ambient temperature for 2 h, steaming at 100 ◦C, and drying using sun drying/shade drying until moisture is 12–14% Simple, easy, and low-cost technology Off-ﬂavor development [3,26] 2. Double boiling process Steaming at 100 ◦C, then soaking for 36 h at ambient temperature and drying using sun/shade drying until 13% moisture content Faster soaking process Off-ﬂavor development and grain bursting [3,26] 3. Hot water soaking process Soaking in hot water at 60–75 ◦C until 24% moisture, steaming at atmospheric pressure, and sun drying or hot air drying until 12–14% MC Reduce soaking time and reduce odor generation Off-ﬂavor generation High wastewater generation [6,27] 4. Limited hot water soaking process Minimum water or recycling water during soaking at 70 ◦C, steaming at 100 ◦C, and drying at room temperature Reduce wastewater generation Risk of uneven quality [18,28] 5. Pressure parboiling process Soaking until the moisture content reaches 24% (40–70 ◦C), steaming above atmospheric pressure at 115 ◦C (69.98 kPa) for 10 min, and drying in a convection oven for 48 h at 25 ◦C Shorter processing time Darker color and more rigid texture [29,30] 6. Pressure parboiling process Soaking at 70 ◦C for 5 h, steaming at 103◦C for 5–10 min, and sieving for 5–15 rpm; drying is only tempered at ambient temperature until moisture was 12–14% Decrease parboiling time and even the quality of parboiled rice. Complex operation [21] 7. Superheated steam process Paddy is steamed and dried using a superheated steam in a ﬂuidized drier; the steam pressure of 1.2 bar and at three temperatures (120, 140, 160◦C) for 6 h were investigated Combining steaming and drying using superheated steam; less chalky kernel, higher head rice yield, lessen dark color High process installation cost, complex operation [23] 8. Dry heat process with halogen lamp drying Dried using a halogen lamp in a hot air-ﬂuidized bed drier at 130, 150, and 170 ◦C with the halogen power set at 1500, 3000, and 4000 W No steam needed Possible complete gelatinization, darker than superheated ﬂuidized bed drier [14] Agriculture 2023, 13, 1390 4 of 24 Table 1.
