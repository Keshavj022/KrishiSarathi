cifa@icar.gov.in Pengba Osteobrama belangeri (Valenciennes, 1844)  Pengba, a State Fish of Manipur, is popular food fish of North East India, and distributed in India, Myanmar and China. Potential species for culture in seasonal ponds and carp polyculture system.  Attains maturity at 2+ years of age when male and female attain weight of 0.6-0.8 and 0.8-1.0 kg, respectively. Breeds in running waters during July-August.  Brooders are raised in earthen ponds along with other carps at biomass of 1500-2000 kg/ha. Sexes are distinguishable with females having bulged abdomen and males with oozing milt on pressing the belly.  Two-year class broodstocks are taken for breeding. Breeds easily with commercial hormone, Ovaprim/Ovatide. Matured males (250-600 g) and females (350-1000 g) are injected with single injection @ 0.30 ml/kg and 0.15 ml/kg, respectively, and are released in spawning pool in 1:1 sex ratio for breeding.  Spawning occurs after 6-8 h of injection. Hatching takes another 14-16 h. Hatchlings reach spawn size in 50-55 h in tropical climate. Around 0.70-1.0 lakh spawn are obtained per kg female body weight.  Spawn are stocked in nursery ponds/tanks at 500-1,000 nos/m3 and fed powdered carp diet for 15-20 days to get fry with 50-60% survival.  The species is largely bred in Manipur, Odisha and West Bengal for food and conservation purposes. 16 Golden Mahseer Tor putitora (Hamilton, 1822)  Golden Mahseer is an important species in upland fisheries of Himalayan sub-continent by virtue of its economic, ecological, recreational, heritage, cultural and food values. It has been declared an endangered fish.  Multiple spawner, spawns in flowing waters during May to September with two peaks during May-June and August-September.  Males mature at the age of 3+ years while females at 5+ years. Sexes are separate and distinct when fully mature, females having bulging belly and males with oozing milt condition.  Captive breeding is undertaken with either fully mature brooders collected from wild or reared in captive conditions that require artificial interventions of temperature and photo period control. The fish does not require any hormonal injection.  Eggs are fertilized by mixing of ova and milt through stripping of female and male brooders. Ova are lemon yellow/brownish-golden. Fully swollen eggs have a diameter of 2.0-2.5 mm. The fecundity ranges 3,000-9,000 eggs/kg female body weight.  Fertilization levels of 90-95% is achieved. Eggs are reared in flow-through hatchery system, where hatching occurs in 80-96 h at 22-24ºC with 80-85% survival.  Yolk-sac is absorbed in 11-13 days and swim-up fry start moving freely. Swim-fry are then shifted to nursery for further rearing.  The breeding technology is largely adopted in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Nagaland, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.
