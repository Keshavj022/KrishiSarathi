 On the basis of the DEG analysis, virus-host interaction in Musa balbisiana was found to bring changes in: (i) cellular signaling machinery, (ii) host gene expression, (iii) hormonal signalling, (iv) cellular metabolism, and (v) host protein degradation pathway. Mapping and transcriptome analysis of seed protein, β-carotene and mineral contents in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.): Chickpea genotypes were characterized for nutritional traits such as total seed protein, minerals (Zn and Fe content) and β-carotene content. Four hundred four chickpea germplasm were characterized for total seed protein content at ICAR-IARI New Delhi, PAU Ludhiana and ICAR- IIPR Kanpur and for Fe, Zn and β-carotene at ICAR-IARI, New Delhi and PAU, Ludhiana. High yielding cultivars were found to contain higher amounts of seed Zn and Fe. There was negative correlation of phytic acid with Zn & Fe. GNG2171, KWR108, Pusa128, JAKI9218, GBM2 and Phule G 95311 were the HYVs containing high Fe and Zn with low phytic acid (4-5 mg/g). High protein genotypes had higher amounts of essential amino acids. Sulphur amino acids showed negative correlation with protein content. The expression analysis of more than 125 genes (across all the traits) was validated qRT-PCR analysis in mature seeds. Zinc and iron contents ranged from 1.10 – 5.91 mg/100g and 0.50 – 8.54 mg/100g, respectively and were comparable to some of the best bio fortified crops of Harvest Plus target levels. High yielding chickpea cultivars were found to contain higher amounts of seed zinc and iron at ICAR-IARI, New Delhi and PAU, Ludhiana. Heera, H82-2 and H214 for Zn; and L550, KGD1168, PG114, JG74 and ICCV6 for Fe are the cultivars identified with higher contents of Zinc (>4 mg/100g) and iron (>6 mg/100g). Analysis of phytic acid in cultivars with higher mineral contents showed negative correlation with zinc and iron. Seed β-carotene content ranged from 248.76 µg/100g (Pusa 72 and ICC 5948) to 538.11 µg/100g (ICC 5002). Transcriptome analysis for seed protein and zinc content using contrasting cultivars identified conserved and novel miRNAs with respect to seed protein content. Large numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified with respect to seed protein and zinc contents between contrasting genotypes. Validation of conserved miRNAs in two cultivars revealed presence of miR399 and miR398 exclusively in high seed protein content cultivar i.e. ICC8397. The expression analysis also resulted in differential expression of miRNAs in two contrasting cultivars. Six of the DEG validated in high and low seed protein genotypes through real-time PCR. Target prediction of miRNAs revealed genes encoding seed storage proteins and their sub-classes as important target genes for both conserved and novel miRNAs. Epigenetic regulation of host-pathogen genetics in leaf rust resistance of wheat: Leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina is a major devastating disease of wheat.
