 Indian Sundarbans are rich in canal systems which covers an area 907.33 ha (Table 1&2) and exist highest at Gosaba block (427.34 ha). The natural forms of these resources are excavated for freshwater by erection/ setting up of sluice gate in the connecting channel of the parent river. Human settlements are prominent in both the banks of these canals in Indian Sundarbans. Industrialization and consequent urbanization in this era has brought environmental degradation and stress on coastal ecosystems of India, which adversely impact their inherent biota, physico-chemical profile of water and productivity. Sundarbans is not an exception from these anthropogenic pressures thereof. Large numbers of canals in Indian Sundarbans are fed by the tidal water through connecting channels (Fig. 1). Naturally, fish enter into these canals and some fish species form natural populations. Yet, information on trophic status of canal habitat, biotic community structure and hydrographical characters are lacking. Hence, ICAR-CIFRI initiated the investigation on trophic status of canal habitat, biotic community structure on three canals; Bhetkimari (21°44’29.7"N 88°15’06.7"E) and Bherua canal, (21°36’38.0" N 88°15’21.1"E) in Namkhana and Bishalakhi canal (21°46’47.3"N 88°05’30.6"E) in Sagar Island of Indian Sundarbans. Physico-chemical properties of soil and water in selected canals of Sundarbans The preliminary investigations of ICAR-CIFRI in selected canals (Namkhana and Sagar Island) of Sundarbans revealed that canals are generally experienced with 8-10 feet Table 2.

Richness and Shannon- Weiner diversity index with a calculated value >2.95 in the studied canals indicated moderately rich phytoplankton diversity in the systems. Similarly, Pielou’s evenness index also calculated with a mean value 0.88 showed the evenly spatial distributions of phytoplankton in the studied canals. Periphyton is the heterogeneous group of community assemblage that attached in plants, woods, stones and various other substrates. It has great importance as primary producers together with phytoplankton and macrophytes which provides foods to many aquatic organisms. The periphytic associations in the selected canals of Sundarbans showed the dominance of six groups which represented as Bacillariophyceae > Cyanophyceae > Coscinodisco- phyceae > Chlorophyceae > Conjugatophyceae > Nematoda.
