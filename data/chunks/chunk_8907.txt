 Sheep for Fine Wool Bharat Merino: Ram lambs for future breeding were selected on the basis of selection index developed by incorporating GFY and body weight at 6 months of age. The overall annual greasy fleece yield of Bharat Merino sheep was 2.02 kg. Annual lambing per cent on the basis of ewes available was 55.0%. The survivability in 0-3, 3-6, 6-12 and adult age groups was 97.40, 98.15, 98.40 and 89.52%. The average body weight at birth, 3,6 and 12 month were 2.75, 11.41, 20.11 and 29.72 kg. The strain has the potential to substitute for the exotic fine wool breed of sheep. Sheep for Mutton Production Malpura: Malpura is an important breed of Rajasthan. Overall means for birth, 3, 6 and 12 months body weight were 2.93, 13.43, 22.04 and 28.65 kg in Malpura, 3.65, 15.58, 24.30 and 32.13 kg in Awassi × Malpura halfbred, and 2.08, 11.54, 17.80 and 23.40 kg in Garole × Malpura. Malpura ewes were crossed with Garole rams considering the importance of multiple births in sheep breeding. Garole × Malpura halfbred ewes yield encouraging results in terms of twin lambing percentage. Of 34 lambings obtained during 2000-2001 from above mentioned genetic group, 44% were twin lambings, whereas, Malpura gave birth to single lambs except 1-2% twin lambing. Survivability of above genetic groups was almost as in semi arid conditions. Garole crosses have the potential for increased lambing rate. A systematic study on Garole sheep was initiated. Network Project on Sheep Improvement Chokla: At the CSWRI, Avikanagar, Chokla sheep is being improved through selection for carpet wool production. Average annual greasy fleece yield was 2.00 kg. Average body weights at birth, 6 month and 12 month of age were 2.53, 16.90 and 22.63 kg, respectively. Overall survivability of the flock was 93%. Annual lambing was 70%. Marwari: At Arid Region Campus (CSWRI), Bikaner, Marwari sheep is being improved through selection for carpet wool production. Males are selected based on selection index incorporating 6-month body weight and first 6 monthly greasy fleece weight. The average birth, 3, 6, 9 and 12 month weights were 2.76, 10.73, 17.17, 21.95 and 22.69 kg, respectively. Birth weight for spring 2001 was 3.08 kg. Elite lambs had higher body weights than tester lambs at all stages of growth. Tupping was 54.3%. Lambing on available and bred basis was 44.1 and 81.1% in elite animals. In tester ewes tupping was 56.9%. Lambing on ewes available and bred basis was 44.1 and 81.1% in elite animals. Lambing on available and bred basis was 47.1 and 82.6% respectively. Elite animals produced heavier clips as compared to tester animals. Average annual greasy fleece weight for adult animals was 1.00 kg. The Avikalin sheep produced annual greasy fleece weight of 1.663 kg in rams and 1.229 kg in ewes Malpura sheep attained 28.
