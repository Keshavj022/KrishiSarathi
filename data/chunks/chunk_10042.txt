 Mandate and activities • Management and promotion of sustainable use of plant genetic and genomic resources of agri-horticultural crops and to carry out related research. • Coordination and capacity building in PGR management and policy issues governing access and benefit sharing of their use. • Molecular profile of varieties of agri-horticultural crop and GM detection technology research. 3. Salient achievements • The institute acts as National Genebank (NGB) repository which is the second largest in the world, in terms of germplasm holdings (~4.6 lakh accessions), has conserved ex situ in the form of seeds/embryo/embryonic axes/ meristems/ DNA as well as whole plants. It currently holds 4,62,466 accessions belonging to 1991 species of agri-horticultural crops and their wild & weedy relatives. In addition, 1,943 accessions are conserved in vitro and 14,468 accessions have been cryopreserved. In the last five years over 64,742 germplasm accessions were provided in the national agricultural system. • A total of 2,835 explorations executed and 2,81,610 accessions of different crops have been collected so far. In addition, >23,665 herbarium specimens of 4,271 species belonging to 1,521 genera and 267 families are conserved in National Herbarium of Cultivated Plants (NHCP). • Stringent quarantine examination of 49,97,795 imported samples resulted in interception of 78 exotic pests of quarantine significance including insects/ mites (26), fungi (6), viruses (19), nematodes (9) and weeds (18) preventing possible yield losses in the event of their introduction into the country. • Institute is ISO 9001:2008 certified for Quality Management System in the mandated PGR activities (w.e.f. 7.3.2015). • Its GM Detection Facility is designated as a ‘National Referral Laboratory’ to detect the presence/absence of LMOs and GMOs under the Seeds Act, 1966 (w.e.f. 15.11.2017) and accredited as per international standard ISO/IEC 17025:2005 (w.e.f. 29.06.2018). 39 Crop Science 39 4. Knowledge/skill/technologies/products other services available for different stake holders Various services provided by Bureau include: • DNA fingerprinting of released varieties in the country. • National supply of germplasm to various stakeholders in the country. • Import and export of PGR under exchange. • Quarantine of imported PGR including transgenics and issue of Phytosanitary Certificate for PGR exported. • Registration of germplasm for unique traits. • GM Lab is gazette notified National Referral Laboratory to detect presence or absence of LMOs and GMOs. • NHCP serves as a reference collection for identification, taxonomic studies and teaching of cultivated plants. • NBPGR has been organizing trainings on PGR management, Biosecurity, GM detection, etc. It is the Centre of Excellence for training on in vitro conservation and cryopreservation for Asia-Pacific Region (since 2006). 40 ICAR Institutes Profile 40 ICAR-National Institute for Biotic Stress Management 1.
