 It involves utilizing inputs such as organic waste, cow dung, green manuring, bio enzymes, and some mechanical operations, which are not only less costly than chemical inputs but also contribute to sustainable agriculture. However, it demands more time and effort. One challenge of organic farming is the need for a substantial amount of organic matter, requiring the maintenance of a large number of animals to generate organic waste. Additionally, inoculating bacterial cultures and using diesel or fuel for mechanical operations entail capital investments that may be beyond the means of small or marginal farmers. Despite growing awareness of the benefits of organic products, distinguishing genuine ones can be challenging. This difficulty arises from the fact that plants absorb nutrients in inorganic forms. Nutrients in organic sources remain unavailable for crop use until the material undergoes decomposition, releasing its nutrients into the inorganic soil pool. Natural farming Natural farming is an ecological farming approach established by Masanobu Fukuoka (1913 to 2008), a Japanese farmer and philosopher. Natural methods of farming respect life, maintain natural laws, and apply natural products. Natural farming includes earthworms, microorganisms, and small creatures and it intends to have a positive impact on the environment. Natural farming restores soil damage caused by chemicals and equipment. Natural farming products offer a pleasant taste, superior quality, and higher yields and have high nutritional content. The very essence of the term suggests that nature takes care of the farming process. This method requires minimal external inputs, with just one indigenous cow being sufficient for nearly 30 acres of land. Renowned natural farming advocate Padmashree Mr. Subhash Palekar emphasized that hybrid seeds are more responsive to chemical fertilizers and pesticides, but their responsiveness diminishes over time with increased use. In contrast, indigenous seeds exhibit high responsiveness to natural farming practices, resulting in more productive, nutrient-rich, and healthier crops compared to hybrid seeds. Mr. Palekar asserts that Basmati Rice production using chemical fertilizers reaches only 12 quintals per acre, while natural farming can elevate it to 18 quintals per acre. Similar benefits are expected for Bansi wheat in the Madhya Pradesh region. Table 1.
