 Data must be stan­ dardized to binary format (0,1) using the minimum and maximum normalization method for the model to progress the interpretation of the model, increase its effectiveness, and reduces error rates (Bhagat et al., 2020; Tumer and Edebali, 2019). The standard value of Vn is shown in Eq. (15). Vn = V −Vmin Vmax −Vmin (15) where Vmin the minimum and Vmax represent the maximum values of the data values in the dataset, V is the actual observed value in the dataset, Vn is the standard value of the actual value in the dataset. In the next step of the mode-building process, the data is split into training and testing datasets. The data in this study were divided in the ratio of 80:20 percent. Twenty percent of the samples are used to test whether the predicted value matches the testing dataset and the remaining eighty percent of samples are used to train the algorithm model. There is no consistent standard rule for segmenting the dataset during model cali­ bration and validation (Bhagat et al., 2021; Singha et al., 2021; Ahmed et al., 2019a, 2019b). 2.6.4. Model calibration and validation In the model calibration step, the training method is optimized by diminishing the loss function. Model weights are computed using the applicable training dataset. At this stage, the model develops a usual error called overfitting, which produces noise and adversely affects training. Hyper-parameters make the model more complicated to opti­ mize and extract information directly from the training dataset. Consequently, hyperparameters of all models were adjusted throughout the model calibration procedure. Model calibration was used by Singha et al. in 2021 in their study to fine-tune the model to reduce errors and block noise. The four categories of irrigation water quality index (0, 1, 2, and 3, 4) are considered as dependant parameters or values for assessment. Model perfection is calculated during training and validation using the following metrics: Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and RMSE-observations stan­ dard deviation ratio (RSR), coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). Model performance can be characterized based on that presented in Table 2 (Moriasi et al., 2007; Singha et al., 2021). The accuracy of the model is shown by a low mean absolute percentage error, while a larger mean absolute percentage error indicates that the accuracy of the model has decreased (Lu and Ma, 2020; Singha et al., 2021). Model Calibration and validation are undertaken by Daggupati et al. (2015); Zamani et al. (2023); Gad et al. (2023); Singha et al. (2021); Moriasi et al. (2007) in their research tune the model and obtain maximum efficacy results. In Table 2 Model performance classification based on the RSR and NSE utilized for the Arjunanadi River basin of south India. Performance RSR or NSE Excellent <0.50 or > 0.75 Good 0.50 to 0.60 or 0.75 to 0.
