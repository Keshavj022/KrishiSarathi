 The number of alleles varied from 2 to 11. Effective number of alleles ranged from 1.09 to 6.46. Allele frequency distribution at 25 loci ranged from 0.01 to 0.92. Other genetic variability measures calculated on the basis of allele frequency included heterozygosity, PIC for each marker and mean diversity indices for the investigated breed. Expected heterozygosity estimates for different microsatellite loci varied from 0.0 to 0.85, and observed heterozygosity values for different markers ranged from 0.004 to 1.000. PIC varied from 0.08 to 0.84. The average high number of alleles (6.20), observed heterozygosity (0.603) and PIC values (0.63) reflected high level of genetic variability in the Garole breed. Estimated means of Wrights fixation index (Fis-0.228) revealed a low rate of inbreeding. LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 97 buffalo and sheep was 379 bp. The RFLP analysis with the restriction enzyme Hin fI and Hind III revealed that all the buffaloes under investigation were homozygous for most favourable allele “B”. The cattle under investigation were heterozygous for this allele, and the sheep had altogether different genotype. Conservation of Animal Genetic Resources Nicobari and Aseel breeds of poultry: Nicobari and Aseel breeds of poultry were subjected to microsatellite analysis at the NBAGR, Karnal. Aseel birds were collected at random from its breeding tract—Baster (Chhattisgarh) and Khammam (Andhra Pradesh). Number of alleles ranged from 3 to 11. Microsatellite loci having PIC values higher than 0.5 were considered highly informative. Unbiased heterozygosity ranged from 0.3472 to 0.8373 in Nicobari and 0.0832 to 0.8513 in Aseel. Both populations revealed higher unbiased-heterozygosity and average- heterozygosity. These high heterozygosity values far exceed the values estimated for commercial breeds. High level of heterozygosity in both the populations signifies that (i) there was very little selection in the population with respect to single/multiple traits of economic importance, and (ii) sufficient numbers of alleles representing genetic diversity existed in the populations studied. The values obtained as mean unbiased heterozygosity over all loci were 0.62 and 0.61 and heterozygosity (direct count) were 0.51 and 0.55, respectively, for Nicobari and Aseel birds. All the loci selected were highly polymorphic and suitable for genetic diversity analysis. A resource population for naked neck gene introgression was developed, and the crossing up to BC1 generation involving two genetic groups (Na. nn and nn. Na) was completed by crossing the F1 and recipient line in reciprocal way. Two panels of microsatellite markers, i.e., panel I of 11 markers from chromosome 3, and panel II of 10 markers from other chromosomes, were identified. Initially the microsatellite markers from chromosome 3 were used in genotyping. The genetic similarity between grand sire and BC 1 progenies ranged from 0.25 to 0.86.
