 It is also tolerant to cowpea golden mosaic virus and Cercospora leaf spot under field conditions. An average green pods yield is 125-150 q/ha. French bean Kashi Sampann: This variety was released and notified by State Variety Release Committee in 2019. It has ability to set fruits at 32-34ºC, hence off-season green pods availability is up to second week of March. This is true vegetable type which yields 24.9 t/ha (green pods). Also, it is tolerant to French bean golden yellow mosaic virus under field condition. March–April 2023 17 Kashi Rituraj has been released for Uttar Pradesh by SVRC in October 2022, and its female parent is a CMS line (VRRAD-201) which has been registered as Unique Germplasm (INGR20032) by ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi in 2020. Water spinach Kashi Mannu: This variety can be grown throughout the year and can withstand extremely high temperature, drought, cold and water-logged conditions along with low input cost required for raising the crop. First variety for upland field conditions and fast growing. First harvesting starts 20-25 days after seed sowing. Leaf biomass yield of 693.0-1000 q/ha; multiple cuttings (3-4 cuttings/ month). drainage induces water-logging situation. Water-logging coupled with high ambient temperature increases the temperature of stagnated water, resulting in quick plant wilting. Tomato is considered one of the most susceptible vegetable crops to excessive soil moisture/ water-logging and excess water which can produce hypoxic and anoxic soil conditions within few hours. To overcome water- logging situation and thereby early production of tomato, grafting study was conducted at ICAR-IIVR, Varanasi during 2013-18. Several rootstocks of brinjal (cultivated and wilds) were evaluated to water-logging tolerance in tomato. Both grafted and non-grafted plants were exposed to water-logging stress for 48 to 120 hour both during vegetative and reproductive stages. All brinjal genotypes showed some tolerance to water-logging situation, but two rootstocks, i.e. IC-111056 and IC-354557 were identified as most promising because tomato grafted on these rootstocks did not show any wilting or yellowing, and also maintained higher CCI, chlorophyll fluorescence yield with optimum enzymatic and non-enzymatic biochemical traits when exposed for 72 hour during vegetative stage (August- September; 30-40 DAT) and 96-120 hour during reproductive stage (November-December; 45-60 DAT). In contrast, the non-grafted tomato plants registered 39.6-41% reduction in Fv/Fm, and 41-100% reduction in CCI at 4 days after relieving from water-logging stress. Non-grafted plants completely wilted and died in 4-5 days after relieving from water stress; whereas the grafted plants recovered completely from 96 hour of water-logging stress shock, 3 days after relieving from the stress. This technology has also been demonstrated successfully at 24 farmer’s fields in 5 villages of Mirzapur and Varanasi districts of Uttar Pradesh.
