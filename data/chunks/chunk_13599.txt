 The second step is to deﬁne network beneﬁciaries (N) as farmers who beneﬁted from a frontline demonstration intervention due to inclusion in a social net- work. Speciﬁcally, Ni ¼ 1ifSN A FLDi > 0 ð4Þ To quantify spillovers, we estimate the percentage of network beneﬁciaries of frontline demonstrations in demonstration villages as the ratio of the total number of network beneﬁciaries in such villages to the total number of farmers in such villages. Similarly, we estimate the percentage of network beneﬁciaries of capacity- building programs in capacity-building program villages as the ratio of the total number of network beneﬁciaries in such villages to the total number of farmers in such villages.27 4.2.3. Effect of frontline demonstrations and capacity-building programs: Network beneﬁciaries To identify the effect of frontline demonstrations on the adop- tion of improved technology for network beneﬁciaries, we deﬁne the treatment group as network beneﬁciaries of frontline demon- strations, but exclude farmers who also received capacity- building program beneﬁts to remove the effect of such programs. Again, the control group comprises non-beneﬁciary farmers who reside either in non-KVK villages or in non-capacity-building pro- gram villages, and it contains 813 farmers for the reasons discussed above. We use the same set of covariates as in Eq. (1). Table 3, Table 3 Summary statistics for FLDs’ primary or secondary and network beneﬁciaries: Treatment vs control group (matched differences).

We use an epanechnikov kernel function and the bandwidth parameter equals 0.06. We deﬁne a common support region by dropping those treated farmers whose propensity score is higher than the maximum or less than the minimum of control farmers and vice versa.
