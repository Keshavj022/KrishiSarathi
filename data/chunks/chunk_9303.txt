 The identified elite females had average lactation yield of 3238 kg in Gir, 3553 kg in Kankrej and 3393 kg in Sahiwal breeds. Similarly, increase in milk production of Frieswal cattle from 3285 in 2014 to 3336 kg in 2019 in a standard lactation of 300 days obtained showing improvement of 1.55%. Overall improvements in milk yields of (305 days) of Gir, Sahiwal and Kankrejbreeds were found to be 36.73, 24.33 and 20.02%, respectively, during a short span of 10 years only (2010 to 2019). Besides this, a few more indigenous cattle breeds namely; Tharparkar and Rathi of Rajasthan, Ladakhi cattle of Ladakh and Khillar from Karnataka state are also being proposed in forthcoming plan (2021-2025). 4.1. Characterization and Conservation of Cattle Genetic Resource About 73% of Indian cattle population is uncharacterized and regarded as non-descript, which poses major hurdle in conservation and improvement of these animals. Sustained efforts are being made for characterization and conservation of the remaining cattle genetic resources of the country by ICAR-National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR), Karnal. The non-descript cattle of the country are being studied for their morphological, biochemical and molecular characteristics for their recognition as breeds. As such, till date 50 cattle breeds of the country have been characterized and gazette notified in The Gazette of Govt. of India. NBAGR is also working on the in-situ and ex-situ conservation of the endangered/critical/ threatened cattle breeds. A national gene bank is also being maintained at NBAGR with semen from large number of indigenous cattle breeds. Conservation of Punganur cattle was taken up under National Agriculture Technology Project (NATP) by NBAGR, Karnal during the years 2000-2004 in collaboration with SVVU, Tirupati and 2691 semen doses were cryo-preserved, whereas conservation of Ongole cattle was taken up by the institute during 2012-17 under Network Project on AnGR and 7100 semen doses were cryopreserved. The ex-situ conservation of Kangayam, Rathi, Nagori, Ponwar, Kherigarh, Bargur breeds through semen cryopreservation, whereas in- situ conservation in Tharparkar, 31 Krishna Valley and Ongole breeds by producing progenies has been undertaken under Network Project on AnGR by NBAGR, Karnal during the period from1997 to 2017. A total of 133608 semen doses of total 24 indigenous cattle breeds have been cryopreserved at NBAGR gene bank. Most remarkable achievement was revival of Krishna Valley cattle in Maharashtra and Karnataka. The number of this cattle breed was reduced to only 400 when NBAGR initiated an in situ conservation program and after 12 years of continuous efforts the number has increased to 10,000. 4.2.
