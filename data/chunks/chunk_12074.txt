Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/ species): ICAR-FUSICONT is a bio-formulation developed using antagonistic fungal isolate CSR-T-3 of Trichoderma reesei and a bacterial PGPR isolate CSR-A-11 of Lysnibacillus fusiforms in a unique IPR protected media with a dynamic substrate. It has an effective shelf life of 14-18 months when stored at ambient temperature. 2. Target crops and delivery system:   ICAR- FUSICONT can be applied in the control of wilt diseases in banana, vegetables (tomato, potato, capsicum, chillies) and spices (cumin and fenugreek).   Can be applied as seed treatment with 1 % solution prepared by dissolving 10 g in 1 litre of water along with 2 g of jaggery.   Field application through drenching with 3 percent solution at the critical stages of the crop growth. 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): All 4. Validation and commercialization: The technology has been validated in the hot spots of banana wilt affected regions of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. It is also being validated under AICRP fruits program for the management of banana wilt disease caused by race 1 at Dr. YSR Horticultural University, Andhra Pradesh, TNAU, Coimbatore, Navsari Agricultural University, Gujarat, Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat and ICAR-Central Institute of Sub-tropical Horticulture, RRS, Malda. Validated for control of cumin wilt in Jodhpur region. The formulation has been submitted for approval of CIB&RC. 5. Benefits It is the only validated effective formulation in the country for the management of devastating outbreak of banana Fusarium wilt disease caused by TR-4. Its application could restore 273 acres of wilt affected banana plantations in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar back in to cultivation and restricted the proliferation of the disease to other districts of the country. The technology revived the income of banana growers in the hotspot region to about 16.38 crores through community based intervention along with ICAR-Central Institute of Sub-tropical Horticulture, Lucknow. 6.
