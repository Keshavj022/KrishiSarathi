Both technologies outperform traditional methods in terms of water-use efficiency, energy conservation, and yield enhancement, proving technically feasible and environmentally sustainable (Dhawan, 2000; Kumar and Palanisami, 2010). Multiple studies have demonstrated the substantial cost savings associated with Micro Irrigation (MI), including up to 25% reduction in fertilizer use, decreased labor expenses, and improved crop yields for cotton, castor, groundnut, and potato by 5% to 80%, all while main­ taining soil health (Bhaskar et al., 2005; Narayanamoorthy, 2006; Verma et al., 2004; Wrachienb et al., 2014; Reddy et al., 2017). Addi­ tional research by Kumar et al. (2016) and Namara et al. (2005) has underscored the water-saving potential of drip irrigation, with optimal field water use efficiency observed at a 65% irrigation level and increased marginal productivity of water with MI technologies. Despite these advantages, the adoption of MI technologies has been limited in water-scarce semi-arid regions of India due to farmers’ capacity constraints, the capital-intensive nature of the technology, and a lack of awareness of its potential benefits (Misquitta and Birkenholtz, 2021; Nair and Thomas, 2023). However, the government’s subsidy scheme for MI aims to encourage wider adoption by farmers. In 2020, the actual area under micro-irrigation covered only 18.7% of semi-arid states and 17.4% across India, raising uncertainty about its future farm-level adoption rate and performance in semi-arid areas. Economic benefits can be realized by farmers through the adoption of MI technologies. Extensive research has identified various factors influencing the adop­ tion of MI technologies, including personal and farm characteristics, economic resources, natural conditions, social networks, and physical assets (Singh and Gandhi, 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Apio et al., 2023; Angom and Viswanathan, 2023; NCAP, 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). Un­ derstanding these determinants, perceptions, and challenges is crucial to enhance farmers’ adaptive capacity and scale up irrigation systems. Therefore, promoting the widespread adoption of MI technologies is Fig. 2. State-wise distribution of the area covered under MI Technologies in India, 2014–15, and 2020–21.
