 Soil, water, plant and manure samples brought by farmers were analyzed at KVKs, and suitable advisories based on analysis were provided to them. Soil health cards (4.56 lakh) were also issued to the farmers by KVKs. During the year, 5.81 lakh farmers visited ATICs for obtaining solutions related to their agricultural problems. Research for tribal and hill regions: During the year, the following crop varieties were released and notified: VL Sweet Corn Hybrid 2, VL Masoor 148, VL Bhat 202 and VL Matar 61. A total of 220.52 q breeder seed of 42 released varieties/inbreds of 15 crops was produced. The 15.18 q Truthfully Labelled (TL) seed of 25 varieties of 16 crops were produced. Sixty rice genotypes were evaluated for leaf and neck blast diseases under the Uniform Blast Nursery system. Four genotypes (VL 865U, A57, GSR 125 and GSR 142) for leaf and five ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 7 OVERVIEW genotypes (VL 3187, VL 31851, VL 31916, VL 31997 and GSR 132) for neck blast were found highly resistant, with 1 disease score on 0-9 scale. The susceptibility of greenhouse whitefly against different insecticides, viz. Thiomethaxam, Imidacloprid and Pymetrozine were high with LC50 values 12.30, 18.62 and 22:38 ppm, respectively. The brinjal accessions both cultivated and wild relatives were screened against the virulent strain Fom-Megh 1 isolated from Meghalaya. All cultivated varieties of brinjal, Pusa Bhairan, Pusa Shyamla, Pusa Uphar, Pusa Ankur and Pusa Purple Round were highly susceptible to Fom-Megh 1 in northeastern region. Dragon fruit cultivation has a huge potential in Mizoram as the climatic condition is highly suitable for better yield and quality with market demand. Shweta Kapila, a cattle breed from Goa was registered with ICAR-NBAGR, Karnal. The value-added formulation CCARI Bio 3 and CCARI Bio 4 was evaluated for their growth-promoting efficiency in the soil @ 50 g/m2. Growth parameters were higher in the value-added formulation compared to untreated control. To improve the livelihood of the tribal farmers of Goa and coastal districts of Maharashtra and Karnataka farm and process machinery, technologies developed by ICAR-CCARI were distributed. Training and awareness required were also carried out for the capacity building of the farmers. Organization and management: Fifty-three new patent applications were filed during this year in different subject domain of agricultural sciences at the Indian Patent Office (IPO). The cumulative figure of patent applications at ICAR has now risen to 1,172 applications. To protect the plant varieties, proposals for 45 varieties (24 extant and 21 new varieties) were filed at Plant varieties and Farmersâ€™ Rights Authority (PPV&FRA). For applications filed earlier, 54 varieties (43 and 11 new) were granted registration certificates during this period, which raised the cumulative figure of registered varieties to 900.
