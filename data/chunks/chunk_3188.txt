 Crop production • Field studies were carried out on various agronomical aspects viz. response of new genotypes to nitrogen application, integrated nutrient management in pearl millet based cropping system, residue management to sustained the productivity of pearl millet, crop establishment under sub‐optimum conditions, amelioration of drought stress, response of pearl millet to zinc application, effect of fertilizer and bio‐fertilizer on pearl millet with and without intercropping under rainfed conditions, irrigation management in summer pearl millet and local specific problems. • Application of 60 kg N/ha increased 21.64 and 7.58 per cent grain and 17.39 and 6.29 per cent fodder yield over 20 and 40 kg N/ha respectively in zone A1. Similarly in zone A, application of 90 and 60 kg N/ha increased 25.5 and 11.4 per cent grain and 18.9 and 10.7 per cent fodder yield over 30 kg N/ha. Also in zone B application of 90 kg N/ha increased 17.65 and 4.82 per cent grain and 21.97 and 4.93 per cent fodder yield over 30 and 60 kg N/ha. • Grain and fodder yields increased significantly in summer pearl millet advance hybrids by application of 120 and 90 kg/ha over the 60 kg N/ha. MSH 155 responded more than MSH 162. Spreading of 5 t FYM over planted rows in A1 and A zone provided better www.icar.org.in 65 2002 ‐ 2007 establishment of the crop and produced maximum grain and fodder yields as well as net return. • Application of 20 kg ZnSO4/ha enhanced grain and fodder yields. Also foliar application of ZnSO4 at tillering and pre‐flowering stage slightly increased grain and fodder yield. • Optimum management of the crop produced 38‐42% more grain and 15‐20% more fodder as compared low management practices in zone A1 and A while only 8% increase in grain yield and 10% increase in fodder yield were observed with optimum management practices in zone B. • Maximum grain yield was recorded in plots of dust mulching when trial was conducted to mitigate the adverse effect of drought stress under rainfed condition. Spray of 0.1% thiourea at tillering and flowering also helped to mitigate drought stress. Pearl millet crop irrigated at an interval of 1.00 IW/CPE ratio produced 12% and 17% more grain and fodder compared to when the crop was irrigated at critical stages. Transfer of technology • Large number of frontline demonstrations on newly developed hybrids/ varieties and on agronomic practices was planned in different states during summer and kharif 2002. Hybrid GHB 526 in summer and hybrid GHB 558 during kharif showed substantial superiority over the check hybrid. A new hybrid CoH(Cu8) showed more than 20 per cent superiority over local. • Frontline demonstrations on 1500 ha were allotted on pearl millet crop during 2003‐04 and these were taken up by different SAUs, ICAR institutions and NGO’s on 1254.80 ha. Of these, 1870 FLDs on 1140.15 ha were successfully harvested.
