 Agri-solar-livestock-fish farming system: In Rajasthan’s arid zones, farmers have integrated agriculture (horticultural crops), livestock, fish farming, and solar energy. Solar panels are installed on the farm to generate electricity, which powers water pumps used for irrigating crops and fish ponds. Livestock manure is used to fertilize crops and fish ponds. Rajasthan State Agriculture Department reported reduction in farmers’ energy costs by 40%, allowing for more efficient irrigation and water-use due to the solar energy. Crop yields increased by 20%, and fish farming contributed to a 30% rise in income. Beel fishery-livestock farming system: In the floodplains of Assam, beel fisheries (seasonal floodplain wetlands) are integrated with livestock rearing (mainly cattle). Fish are stocked in the beel during the monsoon season, while cattle graze around the beel. Manure from the cattle enhances the growth of phytoplankton for fish feeding. This system has maintained fish production despite environmental challenges such as flooding. The integration of cattle has ensured that both fish and livestock continue to thrive even in difficult conditions. Research by the Assam Agricultural University has shown a 50% increase in fish yields, along with a stable income from cattle rearing. Rice-fish-duck farming system: In the Sundarbans, farmers have developed a model that integrates rice farming, fish farming, and duck rearing in the same field. Ducks roam freely in the rice paddies, where they feed on insects and weeds, acting as natural pest control. Fish are cultivated in the water between rice plants, while their waste provides nutrients for the crops. This system has improved yields for rice and fish, increased protein availability, and diversified income streams for the farmers. Ducks also provide eggs and meat, adding to nutritional security. Studies conducted by the ICAR- Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture (CIBA) have shown a 40% increase in rice yield and up to a 30% increase in fish production in such systems. Livestock-poultry-crop farming system in rainfed areas: In the semi-arid regions of Maharashtra, farmers have adopted a farming system that combines livestock rearing (mainly goats and cattle), poultry (local breeds like Aseel), and rainfed crop cultivation (millets, sorghum, and pulses). Goats and poultry are reared alongside crops, and their manure is used to improve soil fertility. The inclusion of poultry provided an additional source of income through egg and meat sales, contributing to a 40% rise in household income. Integrated watershed management with livestock and fish farming system: In the drought-prone regions of Karnataka, watershed management projects have integrated livestock (mainly cows and buffaloes), Indian Farming 63 January 2025 fodder cultivation, and fish farming in community ponds.
