 • Livestock care: Recommendations for providing adequate water and shade to livestock, adjusting feeding times, and taking steps to prevent heat- induced illnesses. • Soil moisture retention: Techniques like deep ploughing and using organic matter to retain moisture in the soil and prevent rapid evaporation during high temperatures. Advisories for managing erratic rainfall • Rainfall forecasting: Short- and medium-term rainfall forecasts enable farmers to adjust their sowing times, optimize water usage, and plan for irrigation or drainage systems. • Contingency crop planning: In regions with unpredictable rainfall patterns, advisories can provide alternative crop plans, such as switching to crops that are more tolerant to delayed or excessive rain. • Drainage management: Recommendations for constructing drainage systems or raised beds to avoid waterlogging during heavy rains, which can damage crops, particularly in areas that face erratic rainfall. Flood management advisories • Flood warnings: The issuance of real-time flood forecasts and alerts allows farmers to safeguard their livestock, store agricultural inputs, and harvest mature crops early. • Soil erosion control: Advisories may suggest planting cover crops or constructing bunds and check dams to prevent soil erosion caused by floods or heavy rains. • Post-flood crop management: Recommendations for replanting fast-growing or flood-tolerant crops after floodwaters recede, as well as guidance on restoring soil health. Cyclone risk mitigation • Cyclone alerts: Early warnings of impending cyclones allow farmers in nearby dryland regions to take preventive actions, such as securing greenhouses, shifting livestock to safer areas, and harvesting mature crops. • Crop protection measures: Advice on how to minimize cyclone damage through the use of windbreaks, sturdy staking for horticultural crops, and protection of nurseries. • Post-cyclone recovery: Guidance on replanting and rehabilitating damaged fields after cyclones, as well as measures to restore soil fertility by incorporating organic matter. Cold wave management advisories • Cold wave forecasts: Timely forecasts of cold spells help farmers prepare for frost or low temperatures, particularly in northern India’s dryland regions. • Frost protection: Advisories recommend techniques like covering sensitive crops with plastic sheets or using smoke to reduce frost impact. Farmers are also advised to irrigate fields before cold waves, as moist soil retains heat and can help protect crops. • Crop selection: Suggestions for cold-tolerant crop varieties and adjusting planting schedules to avoid sensitive growth stages during periods of extreme cold. Pest and disease management under extreme weather • Weather-pest forecast integration: Advisories based on the relationship between weather conditions and pest/disease outbreaks.
