Progress in pulse and oilseed production and Import reduction During 2015-16 to 2020-21, agri-exports from India were increased by nearly 1.43 times and agri-imports by nearly 1.06 times. Indian agricultural produce that includes dairy, cereals, spices, fruits & vegetables, rice, wheat, cotton, and others are exported to more than 100 countries while India majorly imports vegetable oils, fresh fruits, pulses, and spices. Vegetable oil accounts for more than half of the agri-imports while fresh fruits and pulses accounts for almost 10 and 8 per cent respectively. Government has initiated several initiatives to reduce the imports and ICAR is supporting it through continuous efforts in research and development on the targeted commodities, particularly pulses and oilseeds. Major achievements and efforts made by ICAR in reducing imports are briefly described below: 31 DARE–ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2021-22 Increase in Area, Production and Yield of Pulses Years Area (m ha) Production (m t) Yield (kg/ha) 2015-16 24.91 16.32 655 2020-21 28.83 25.72 892 % Increase 15.73 57.60 36.18 yy The increase in pulse production during last six years (2015-16 to 2020- 21) was about 57.6% with increase in area by ~15.7% and yield by ~36.2%.
