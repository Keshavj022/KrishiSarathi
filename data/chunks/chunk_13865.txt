PHCs are the base characteristic for buyers in columns (3) and (4). Information received from the government is the base characteristic for information sources for columns (1), (3), and (4). Information received from NGOs is the base characteristic for the information source for column (2). Complete regression results are shown in the Appendix. A.H. Villacis et al. Economic Analysis and Policy 81 (2024) 1308–1321 1317 Table 5 reports these results for the statistically significant market channel variables reported in Table 4. Panel A in Table 5 shows estimates of Oster’s delta, and Panel B estimates Diegert et al.’s breakdown point. Oster (2019) suggests that a |δ| > 1 leaves limited scope for unobservables to explain results. Thus, based on estimates from Panel A, unobservables are unlikely to drive our results for baby corn, okra, and onion – Columns (2), (3), and (4), respectively. However, our results for Column (1), although close to 1, suggest we need to be cautious when discussing the negative relationship between prices received by pomegranate farmers and selling to APMC mandi markets. The estimates from Panel B of Table 5 confirm these conclusions, which allow for arbitrarily endogenous controls. Columns (2), (3), and (4) of Panel B indicate that the breakdown point estimates for baby corn, okra, and onion are between 40% and 100%. For example, for the average price received by onion farmers, we can conclude that APMC mandi markets β > 0 as long as the selection on unobservables is 99.90% as large as the selection on observables. In contrast, the breakdown point estimate in Column (1) is substantially smaller: 11.80%. For this outcome, we only need the selection of unobservables to be at least 12% as large as the selection of observables to overturn the conclusion that APMC mandi markets β < 0. The findings based on Oster’s and Diegert, Masten, and Poirier’s (2022) methods show that the pomegranate (high-value export crop) analysis is highly sensitive to selecting unobservables. In contrast, the analysis for the high-value local crops (baby corn, okra, and onion) is quite robust to the choice of unobservables. Based on the above robustness test results, Fig. 2 illustrates a sequence of estimated identified sets for the high-value crops’ sta­ tistically significant market channel variables (baby corn, okra, and onion). The identified sets of coefficients (β) are a function of rx, which is plotted on the horizontal axis.
