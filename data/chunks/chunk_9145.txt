Research on the crop began in 1935 at the newly established potato-breeding substation of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, acquiring the status of a full-fledged Institute, Central Potato Research Institute, Shimla, in 1949. Early collections of the potato varieties and species had been built up at this station especially with the cooperation of the Commonwealth potato expeditions.
