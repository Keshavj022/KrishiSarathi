Handholding Support by CAFT Centres: Response of CAFT Directors To assess the perceived impact of CAFT programmes on various activities of participants as perceived by the CAFT Directors based on their experiences in handholding support, an instrument was designed to get the opinion of CAFT Directors. The instrument was circulated among CAFT Directors with a request for quick response. More than two-third (68%) of the CAFT Directors responded for this survey. Based on the response of CAFT Directors, it was understood that an average of 23 programmes were organized by CAFT Centres so far and an average of 400 participants/ CAFT Centre were benefitted. The results of such survey are given below. Table 30. Handholding Support-Response of CAFT Directors # Handholding by CAFT Directors Average impact 1.
