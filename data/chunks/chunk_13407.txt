 Bioversity International would be continuing the work on Seeds for Needs and Community Seed Bank projects, management and mitigation of the spread of Tropical Race 4 of Fusarium wilt in banana, facilitation of germplasm import of the selected crops (wild species of cotton, winter wheat, temperate fruits, trait specific soybean, cocoa, oil palm, olive and other identified germplasm), developing protocols for cryopreservation and regeneration of difficult-to-store species and developing human resource in this technology and establishing mother clone orchards, exploration, collection, ex-situ conservation, evaluation, chemical profiling of Neglected and Underutilized Species (NUS) of promising fruits, vegetables, root and tuber ICAR-CGIAR Agricultural Cooperation 6 crops and the wild relatives of crop plants, establishment of “Community Germplasm Banks” involving custodian farmers, studies on ecosystem services and project on mainstreaming agro-biodiversity conservation and utilization in agricultural sector to ensure ecosystem services and reduce vulnerability will be taken up. ICARDA has made good efforts for bringing germplasm to India for use by the national program. A need has been highlighted to define heat stress and to develop new varieties of wheat with specific traits for the country. Besides this, introduction of disease resistant (Stemphylium blight) and high yielding lentil varieties from Bangladesh to India and their testing, interventions both on mapping of rice fallows and technical interventions of growing pulses like lentil and grasspea, bringing grasspea lines having less ODAP from ICARDA HQ to the Indian program for growing in barren areas and introduction of better varieties of date palm for multiplication and large scale demonstrations will be taken up. IFPRI will focus on estimating returns on agricultural research investment and mapping adoption of improved technologies, strategies to enhance pulse production and to stabilize prices, developing transparent performance indicators for KVKs, developing mechanisms to implement innovative institutional arrangements (such as e-NAM, farmer producer organization and PMFBY) and to assess their impact on smallholders, and constraints in adoption of improved varieties and technologies be given more emphasis, especially in eastern India, and it should include strengthening of seed chain and delivery of key inputs and resources to the farmers. CIMMYT is providing germplasm of wheat for quite long, a comprehensive document on how we are getting benefits of this germplasm in release if varieties and status of use of this germplasm in ICAR programmes is to be prepared by ICAR-IIWBR, Karnal. Also, the genetic gain in the existing varieties is to be mentioned.
