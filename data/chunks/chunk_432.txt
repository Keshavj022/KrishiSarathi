 Soils on active flood plains (Tall lands) are moderately suitable for wheat and maize (rabi) and marginally suitable for rabi-pulses and rabi- vegetables due to the constraints Fig. 2. Representative soils under different landform types of the study area. Table 1. Major constraints and land suitability assessment of the study area Landform Major land use Constraints Land suitability with best management practice (BMP) Meander plains Paddy-Fallow Maize-Fallow Sugarcane Moderate to severe flooding, strong soil alkalinity and high calcareousness of soils, low OC, low availability of nitrogen and phosphorus and Zn-deficiency in soils Paddy- S3fns; Wheat-S2fnsw; Maize-S2fnsw; Rabi-Pulses-S3fnsw; Rabi-Vegetables-S3fsnw; Makkhana-S2fn; Mango/Litchi-S3fnw BMP- Conservation tillage, Ridge and furrow, Recommended dosage + 25% Extra N+P, Zinc sulphate @ 25 kg/ha, Phosphate solubilizing bacteria and Blue Green Algae (Nostoc, Scytonema, Microcoleus sp.) @ 5 kg/ha, FYM @10-15 t/ha.
