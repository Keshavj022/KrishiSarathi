The four IFS models were 1), Agriculture + Horticulture + Animal Husbandry + Fisheries + Water harvesting; 2), Agriculture + Horticulture + Silviculture + Animal Husbandry + Fisheries + Water harvesting; 3), Agriculture + Horticulture + Animal Husbandry + Water harvesting and; 4), Horticulture + Animal Husbandry + Water harvesting. The selected farmers involved were initially given trainings on IFS approaches, system objectives, goals and field demonstration and visits were conducted on the research farm. They were also supported with farm inputs under the programme of ICAR Centre and constant technical guidance was given to the farmers to adopt the new farming system. Regular field visits and inspections were carried out for successful intervention of the IFS model. Farmers’ practice before IFS intervention All the farmers have practiced traditional mixed farming system using locally sourced seeds, poor yielders, and without following scientific method of cultivation. The farm components were not utilized efficiently and were lacking important components for sustainability of the farm. The farmers practiced mixed cropping without crop and soil management and were grown under rainfed condition. Crop production was not carried out during rabi due to lack of proper water harvesting structures. Only few perennial crops were irrigated during dry spells with poor irrigation facilities from pond water or rivers nearby. Poor allocation of farm resources hampered easy resource cycling and management resulting in lowering IFS model 1: Agriculture + Horticulture + Animal husbandry + Fisheries + Water harvesting IFS model 2: Agriculture + Horticulture + Silviculture + Animal husbandry + Fisheries + Water harvesting Indian Farming 42 August 2023 farm productivity. Fish ponds were also not managed properly (Table 1A). Farmers’ practice after IFS intervention and their impact on farm income With the technical guidance of ICAR centre and support through need-based inputs, the four IFS models were found to be more profitable than mixed farming systems before technology intervention. The gross income of the four IFS models was higher to the extent of 115.03– 321.
