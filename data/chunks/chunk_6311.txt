Results and discussion Application of ITK ointment revealed that, there was significant reduction in the swelling as well as pain in shoulder in all the animals. Further it was found that, there was reduction in mean scores of swelling of joints and limbs. The pain decreased after the application of ITK on the affected part. The treated animals also revealed gradual improvement in weight- bearing scores. Iodine ointment is a proven mild counterirritant and strong antiseptic, having ability to dilate the superficial blood vessels with enhancing phagocytosis, which literally helps dilute and drain the inflammatory fluid through lymphatic and thereby reduce the inflammation of the part. It was also found that there was regular linear decline trend of swelling over leg and joints. The overall observation revealed the decreasing trend of swelling on day 30 as compared to day zero which suggested that the application of ITK and iodine ointment on swelling was found to be effective due to its anti-inflammatory action. Further, it was found that, weight bearing depends upon extent of inflammation of the joint, flexor tendon, ligament, nerve, weight of the animals and the type of work extracted. If such animals are used for heavy work, they show signs of lameness. However, low-grade inflammation of the part could be treated successfully with ITK ointment. If ligaments or tendons are affected, more time is required for healing. Therefore weight bearing is delayed.
