Third, it can reduce regional disparities and ensure that people in these areas can access the same opportunities as those in more prosperous areas. Fourth, districts with low food grain productivity are often vulnerable to environmental degradation due to unsustainable agricultural practices and climate change and its impact. Improving agricultural productivity using sustainable agriculture practices can reduce the adverse impact of climate change, protect the environment, and support long- term food security. Thus, prioritizing low-food grain productivity districts is important for addressing poverty, food insecurity, environmental sustainability, climate resilience, and promoting inclusive growth. Low crop productivity in these districts may be due to low and erratic rainfall, inadequate water resources, poor soil quality, and undulated farmland. To increase crop yield and reduce production risk, efficient water management, in-situ water conservation, and rainwater storage structures for supplementary irrigation can be employed.
