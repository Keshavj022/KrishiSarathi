 This emphasis on in-kind transfers could also potentially explain why the casual daily agricultural cash wage does not appear to respond in Table 9. Next, I present cultivators with a series of hypothetical scenarios pertaining to agriculture (Fig. 4, Panel B). In the first hypothetical scenario, I describe the option of hiring agricultural labor from two equidistant villages – one with a hard-topped road and one with a dirt road – and elicit responses on hiring preferences. While 99 percent of respondents report that workers from both villages would be equally hardworking, 76 percent express a strict preference for hiring from the village with a hard-topped road. In the second hypothetical scenario, I describe the construction of a new road that connects the village to a nearby village that was not easily accessible previously by road, and elicit responses on how cultivation practices would be affected. 43 percent of cultivators report that it would be easier for them to find workers to hire for work on their land and 29 percent report that they would be able to hire workers more frequently, while only 8 percent report that it would be less expensive to hire labor. This suggests the existence of underlying frictions in the rural labor market – for example, transaction costs associated with hiring agricultural labor (Binswanger and Rosenzweig, 1984) – that are alleviated by improvements in connectivity. Taken together, these results suggest that even in villages that have existing road connectivity at baseline, establishing a reliable supply of agricultural labor remains to be an important concern during the agricultural peak season. Access to extension workers and traders. Improvements in road in- frastructure can increase access to key agricultural agents such as extension workers and traders (Owens et al., 2003; Anderson and Feder, 2007). The most recent round of the REDS survey included modules on households’ sources of information on issues pertaining to agriculture – types of agricultural credit, input and output prices – as well as households’ crop production practices. Since this module was only added to the 2006 REDS survey, I am unable to run the difference-in-differences analysis on this set of outcomes. Instead, I plot the frequency at which households report extension workers (panel A), traders (panel B) and village elders/neighbors/friends (panel C) Journal of Development Economics 152 (2021) 102686 15 Y.
