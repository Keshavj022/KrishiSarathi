Majority (80.0 %) of households produced these for their own consumption. In contrast, potato, onion, and garlic were exclusively grown for household use. Pesticides were reportedly used mainly for wheat by 78.2 % of wheat cultivators. Pesticide use was re­ ported to be a common practice in village and was primarily for pest and weed control. Private markets were the primary source of pesticides, and government guidelines regarding their usage were not followed. 3.1.2. Animal health profile Livestock rearing was reported by 68.8 % of the households. The section on animal health profile in the village aimed at identifying if the households were investing their time in rearing animals, to meet their dairy requirements or sell the products to get some extra money, or habitually or because they got some provision to do so. Of the total households, 68 % responded that they had livestock at home (irre­ spective of their primary source of income) The livestock population consisted mainly of buffaloes, cows and goats. Fourteen cows and 48 buffaloes were pregnant at the time of the survey. In the past year, three cows suffered from lumpy disease, while 48 buffaloes experienced various health issues, including fever, uterine prolapse, failed preg­ nancy, and post-partum illness. Veterinary services were sought for the treatment of these ailing livestock. 3.1.3.
