 In addition to farmers utilizing SMI, a Rajasthan farmer and breeder have introduced a variety known as, yielding between 3-3.5 tonnes per hectare with an impressive 42% oil content. Nutrient management During field preparation, the application of fertilizer is crucial, incorporating compost @ 8 t/acre, Trichoderma @ 1.5 kg/acre, DAP @27 kg/acre, and MOP @ 13.5 kg/acre. Subsequently, @ 15 DAT, plants should receive 27 kg of urea/acre. Depending on weather conditions, at 35 DAT, urea should be applied at the root zone @13.5 kg per acre. At 40 DAT, plants can be provided with Nursery and transplanting Effect of system of mustard intensification on mustard plant Field visit by Dr S S Rathore (Head, Division of Agronomy), Dr T K Das (Professor, Division of Agronomy) and P R Sahu (Research Scholar), ICAR-IARI, New Delhi 60 cm × 60 cm transplanting Direct sowing Direct sowing Direct sowing 60 cm × 60 cm transplanting 60 cm × 60 cm transplanting Indian Farming 14 January 2024 13.5 kg of MOP per acre (equivalent to 8.1 kg of potassium per acre). The judicious use of fertilizers is a cornerstone of SMI. Soil testing is recommended to determine the specific nutrient requirements of the mustard crop. This personalized approach to nutrient management ensures that the plants receive the right balance of essential elements for robust growth. Weed management SMI advocates for non-chemical weed control methods. Mechanical methods such as inter-cultivation and hand weeding are preferred to minimize the environmental impact of herbicides. This approach not only reduces input costs for farmers but also aligns with sustainable farming practices. Weeding should be carried out within the first 20 days after transplanting and then again at 35 DAT to minimize competition between the crop and weeds. This can be achieved through either hand weeding or mechanical weeding. Pest and disease management White rust (Albugo candida or A. cruciferarum), downy mildew (Peronospora parasitica), and powdery mildew (Erysiphe cruciferarum) stand out as the major diseases affecting mustard. These can be effectively controlled through seed treatment with Trichoderma at a rate of 4g/kg of seeds, followed by a single spray of Metalaxyl (Ridomil MZ) at 0.2%. Mustard aphid and painted bug are the major insects of mustard can be controlled through imidacloprid (17.8 SL) @ 0.2 g/litre. Challenges The system of mustard intensification prescribes specific recommendations for water, nutrients, and spacing. Some farmers may encounter challenges in implementing these agronomic principles due to resource constraints, particularly regarding nursery preparation, seed treatment, water availability and the affordability of inputs. The effectiveness of SMI may vary across regions and climates, requiring tailored approaches to suit diverse agro-ecological conditions. Addressing this challenge mandates strategic outreach and education efforts for successful adoption.
