 Citrus, Apple and Grapes Drones Garuda Aerospace Drone technology is used for precision spraying of pesticides, fertilizers, and nutrients, significantly reducing chemical usage and improving crop health. Drones also carry out surveillance and crop monitoring. Banana and grape farmers in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh use Garuda drones to spray micronutrients and pesticides over large areas. This reduces human exposure to chemicals, lowers application costs, and ensures uniform coverage, especially in hilly terrains and large orchards. Banana, Grapes and Pomegranate Aarav Unmanned Systems Drones equipped with multispectral sensors capture high-resolution images of fields, helping farmers detect crop stress, nutrient deficiencies, and pest infestations. It facilitates timely intervention and improves yield. In Maharashtra’s mango and citrus orchards, drones help detect early signs of water stress or pest damage by analyzing the reflected light from crops. This information enables farmers to take preventive measures, saving them from potential yield losses. Mango and Citrus Skymet Weather Services Drones are used to gather micro-climatic data to monitor weather patterns and assess crops’ vulnerability to extreme weather events like droughts or floods. Over 250 Air Quality Sensors, and 1,000 Lightening Detector Sensors that can detect Lightening to Cloud to Ground which is required to predict the areas under thunderstorms and hailstorms. The data helps farmers plan better and adapt to climate risks. Pomegranate and orange farmers of Nagpur in Maharashtra use this service to receive alerts on extreme weather conditions. This helps them take precautionary measures such as installing protective nets or adjusting irrigation schedules. Pomegranate and Orange Robotic Harvesters Nanovel (Autonomous Tree Fruit Harvestor) Robots designed for automated harvesting, can pick fruits like apples and citrus based on ripeness. They use sensors and AI to identify ripe fruits and ensure gentle handling to avoid damage. In California, USA, fruit orchards are testing robotic harvesters for mango and citrus. These robots are capable of working for longer hours and handling labour shortages, reducing harvest time while maintaining fruit quality. Citrus, Stone fruit, Avocado and Mango Agribot (Multi-Tasking Agricultural Robots) Agribot designs multi-tasking robots capable of performing activities such as planting, spraying, and harvesting in horticulture. These robots can be programmed to perform repetitive tasks with minimal human intervention. In Tamil Nadu, Agribot is being used in lemon plantations for tasks like planting, spraying pesticides, and fertilizers. The robot’s precision helps to optimize input usage, minimize wastage, and reduce manual labour in large citrus farms.
