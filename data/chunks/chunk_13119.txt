It is distributed in Indo-Pacific region from Red Sea and East Africa to Australia.  Euryhaline and can tolerate fresh to seawater salinity. Spawn in the sea and juveniles migrate into freshwater for growth.  Sexes are separate, but difficult to differentiate. Generally, bigger sizes are female and smaller are males. Mature males exude white milt on pressing the belly, whereas female are identified through cannulation of eggs and measuring ova diameter.  Broodstocks of 100-150 g are developed in small net cages (2 m x1 m x1 m) in ponds or open- water bodies at 100 nos/cage.  A 100 g female release about 80,000-1,00,000 eggs. Hatching can be noticed after 16-18 h and the hatchlings measure 2.0 mm in size.  Larval rearing is done by stocking the larvae in 10 ton FRP tanks @ 10-15 nos/litre with addition of green algae, Chlorella salina and rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis as initial feed and later with Artemia salina nauplii. The larvae can be easily weaned to artificial feed at the fry stage.  By 45 days, the larvae reach to fry size of 2.0 cm and weigh 300-400 mg. Survival rates of 30- 40% can be attained with good feed, water quality and health management practices.  The technology is being extended in Tamil nadu. Compiled by: Dr S.N. Sethi, Dr M.U.

Considered an important fish for mariculture.  Wild caught sub-adults of cobia (5-6 kg) are developed into broodstock in sea cages. Gravid males and females are identified through cannulation and tagging since sexual dimorphism is not distinct in this species.  Mature fishes weighing around 8-10 kg and above, with female having more than 20% of the intra-ovarian egg diameter above 700 µm, are transferred to the spawning tank (>60 tonne capacity) for spawning induction with a female: male ratio of 1:2.  Spawning is induced through single injection of HCG@ 500 IU/kg body weight for female and 250 IU/kg body weight for males. Fish breeds naturally in the tank and lay 0.5-2.5 million eggs.  Eggs are incubated in 2 tonne capacity tanks at stocking density of 200-500 eggs/litre, which hatch within 18-22 h and develop to larvae in 60-72 h.
