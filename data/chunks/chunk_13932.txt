 Even though government implemented several agricultural credit pol­ icies, majority of the farmers face barriers in accessing the agricultural credit in India where only 33 % of farmers have access to credit facilities (Ramasamy & Malaiarasan, 2023). This indicates inefficient credit dis­ tribution system that excludes a majority of farmers. In this context, the gap between policy intentions and practical outcomes becomes even more critical. Therefore, the need for effective sustainable agricultural credit policies should be given paramount importance where agriculture forms the backbone of the economy and sustains the livelihood of mil­ lions in a developing country like India. Many studies explored and concluded that access to agricultural credit is essential for rural development and allows farmers to make investments that increase productivity and income (Benson & Faguet, 2023; Ogundeji et al., 2018; Sekyi et al., 2017). Studies show that credit boosts productivity by 24 % and reduces downside risk by 16 % (Birthal et al., 2025). Further, a study by (Sher et al., 2024) referred that sus­ tainable finance policies such as interest-free credit, has been shown to improve smallholders' marketing decisions, producer prices, and tech­ nological progress, leading to increased sustainable supply response and farmers' income. Such timely interventions proven to be more impactful in agricultural development. In particular, researchers propound that the different types of policy interventions such as influencing income diversification (Saqib et al., 2016), doubling of agricultural credit (Manoharan & Varkey, 2022) to farmers is crucial for economic devel­ opment and socio-economic transformation, as it can lead to improved * Corresponding author.

Farmers require credit for investment, short-term crop production, and consumption, which are essential for family sustenance (Assouto & Houngbeme, 2023; Jia et al., 2015). (Martey et al., 2019) argued that credit may help farmers adopt more efficient production technologies and cope with income variation. Furthermore, credit support will motivate farmers to employ various techniques such as crop rotation, cover crops, agroforestry, organic farming, carbon sequestration, decreased tillage, water management strategies, and precision agricul­ ture to preserve environmental sustainability.
