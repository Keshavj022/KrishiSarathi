 The immediate short-term impact is a reduction in TRP incidences, with notable improvements in animal health and productivity. Using magnets also lowers the risk of severe conditions like peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal lining) or traumatic pericarditis (inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart), both of which can be fatal. Better health results in higher productivity; healthier animals The videographic success story of oral magnet therapy has been documented and uploaded on the FFP Portal which can be viewed using the link below https://ffp.icar.gov.in/images/upload_video/FFP%20GADVASU%20(S.%20Lachman%20Singh).mp4 Picture showing the placement of plastic pipe and oral magnet in dairy animal Oral Magnet Plastic pipe Indian Farming 27 October 2024 utilize feed more efficiently, which leads to higher milk yields and growth rates. The long-term impact involves the lifelong protection provided by oral magnets in preventing TRP, resulting in lower mortality and culling rates on the farm. By preventing TRP, oral magnets help extend the productive lifespan of dairy animals, thereby reducing herd replacement costs. Treating TRP can be costly, involving veterinary services, medications, surgery, or euthanasia in severe cases. Preventing TRP with magnets reduces these expenses by eliminating the need for extensive medical intervention. Furthermore, oral magnet therapy aligns with animal welfare and ethical standards, as it avoids unnecessary pain caused by metallic objects. The administration of an oral magnet is a simple, non-invasive procedure that can be performed by a veterinarian or experienced farm staff, requiring minimal animal handling and no special treatment. Economics In this study, an assumption-based economic model was developed to assess the economic impact of oral magnets. This model considered the cost of the animal, feeding costs, treatment costs, and milk production losses. If an animal dies due to TRP, it is a direct loss to the farmer. In the project area, the cost of a buffalo producing 10 litres of milk ranges from ` 80,000 to 1.00 lakh, while a cow with the same milk yield costs between `60,000 and 80,000. However, if the animal suffers from TRP, losses accrue from treatment costs, feeding costs, and lost milk production. Surgical correction of TRP or diaphragmatic hernia (a complication of TRP) can cost between `15,000 and 25,000. During recovery from surgery and the resumption of milk production, the animal must be fed a full ration, with per-day feed costs for a 10 litre milk-producing animal ranging from `100 to 150. Milk yield reduction of up to 80% has been observed in animals with TRP, and even after surgical correction, the animal takes a long time to regain peak yield levels. As a result, an entire lactation cycle can be lost due to TRP, creating a major economic setback.
