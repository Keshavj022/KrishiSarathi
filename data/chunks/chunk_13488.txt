 Shafi (1960) subsequently applied this method to evaluate agricultural efficiency in Uttar Pradesh (India), focusing on eight crops. Sapre and Deshpande (1964) introduced crop share weightage to enhance the precision of the ranking coefficient method. The “weighted average yield efficiency index” introduced by Bhatia (1967a, b) played a pivotal role in measuring the spatio-temporal variation of agricultural efficiency. Khursheed and Taufique (2019) applied Bhatia’s methodology to assess horticulture efficiency in India, focusing on five major fruits. Agricultural efficiency, representing the interplay between input and output, denotes the optimal productivity achievable from agricultural land (Dayal, 1984). Shafi (1960) attributed the maximum output per unit area of agricultural land to soil, climate, and farming techniques. Burja and Burja (2016) underscored the substantial impacts of key factors such as land, capital, and farm size on agricultural efficiency. Shafi (1960) asserted that achieving the maximum output per unit area indicates higher efficiency for the agricultural land. This perspective contrasts with the finding of Nin-Pratt et al. (2010), who reported sluggish agricultural productivity growth in India. This discrepancy emphasizes the need for thorough micro-level studies in policy-making to enhance agricultural output. 3. Study area and methods 3.1. Study area Karnataka State (11°30′–18°25′N, 74°10′–78°35′E) is located in the west-central part of India, encompassing coastal plains, gentle slopes, and the elevated Western Ghats (Fig. 1). From a physiographic standpoint, the state can be classified into four regions: northern, central, and southern Karnataka Plateau, and Karnataka coastal region. The state’s agricultural land is primarily dependent on the precipitation from southwest monsoon. Karnataka constitutes 5.83% (19.10×106 hm2) of the total land area and 5.05% of the total population in India, positioning as the sixth-largest state by area and the eighth-largest by population. The net crop area of this state is 10.70×106 hm2, accounting for 55.60% of its total land area. However, only 35.01% of the total crop area is under irrigation (Department of Economics and Statistics, 2019). The occupation rate in the state is reported at 45.60%, involving 13.70×106 persons (49.28% of the total population) directly engaged in agricultural activities. According to the Agriculture Statistics at a Glance 2014 (Government of India Ministry of Agriculture Department of Agriculture & Cooperation Directorate of Economics & Statistics, 2014), agricultural land in 2010–2011 amounted to 7.83×106 hm2, of this, 49.14% of the agricultural land is categorized as marginal land and 27.30% as small land, S.
