 po Onan w Integration of innovative applications across domains would be much easier. 10. Device Management becomes easy. 11. Certification would become feasible (with standardized test suites) for- a. Devices: Ecosystem of Certified products b. Applications: Sharing of data, interworking, Security c. Services: Compliance C-DOT Common Service Platform (CCSP): C-DOT Common Service Platform (CCSP) for loT/ M2M Communication is based on oneM2M specifications. CCSP (loT platform) allows any loT application to discover and interact with any loT device.

DoT/ TEC Initiatives in M2M/ IoT Domain DoT/ TEC has taken several initiatives to facilitate organized and sustainable growth in M2M/IoT domain. Few important initiatives are given below- 1. National M2M Roadmap was released in 2015 (https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/National%20Telecom%20M2M%20Roadmap.pdf). Through this document “National Telecom M2M Roadmap”, Government has made efforts to put together various standards, policy and regulatory requirements and approach for the industry on how to look forward for M2M. This document focuses on communication aspects of M2M with emphasis on Interoperable standards, policies and regulations to suit Indian conditions across sectors, across the country. 2. National Digital Communication Policy (NDCP) was released in 2018 (https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Final%20NDCP-2018_0.pdf). It covers many points related to IoT, Artificial Intelligence and 5G including ‘ Developing market for IoT/ M2M connectivity services in sectors including Agriculture, Smart Cities, Intelligent Transport Networks, Multimodal Logistics, Smart Electricity Meter, Consumer Durables etc. incorporating international best practices’. 3. Guidelines for KYC of M2M SIMs & Instructions for embedded-SIMs (e-SIMs) were issued in 2018 (https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/M2M%20Guidelines.PDF?download=1). It describes the Instructions for implementing restrictive feature for SIMs used only for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication services (M2M SIMs) and related Know Your Customer (KYC) instructions for issuing M2M SIM to entity/organization providing M2M Communication services under bulk category and instructions for Embedded- SIMs (e- SIMs). 4. The 13-digit numbering plan for SIM based IoT/ M2M devices has been implemented w.e.f 1st October 2018. 5. The oneM2M Release 2 and Release 3 specifications have been adopted as National Standards by TEC, DoT in 2020 and 2022 respectively. The important benefits of implementing oneM2M standards based solution includes interoperability of device & application; authentication & authorization of devices; and Data security & Privacy. Details of these National Standards are available on TEC website (https://www.tec.gov.in/onem2m). 6.
