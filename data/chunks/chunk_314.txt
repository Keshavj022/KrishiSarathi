 The ICMR recommendation is 180 eggs per person per year. This clearly depicts the huge gap present in NEH region. Table 3.

By seeing the challenges faced by tribal people of NEH region, ICAR has introduced improved backyard poultry germplasm in NEH Region through Poultry Seed Project. Vanaraja and Srinidhi poultry developed by ICAR-Directorate of Poultry Research, Hyderabad are dual purpose birds suitable for backyard poultry farming in rural and tribal areas for meat and egg purpose, respectively. Due to the similarity in phenotypical appearance of these birds with desi birds, these birds are well adopted and accepted by the tribal farmers of the region. In addition, these birds lay brown coloured eggs and their meat texture and flavour is almost similar to desi birds. Moreover, these birds have higher growth rate, less mortality, brown colour egg and higher egg production. Vanaraja cocks attain 2.5 to 3.0 kg body weight in three to four months and hens lay 120 to 150 eggs in backyard conditions with little supplementary feeding. Similarly, Srinidhi male birds attain 2.5 to 3.0 kg in three to four months and female birds lay 220 to 250 eggs in one laying cycle in backyard production system. Since the inception of Poultry Seed Project at ICAR Nagaland in 2010-11, ICAR Nagaland Centre has provided around ten lakhs of improved backyard poultry germplasm to more than five thousand tribal households. Besides, the ICAR Nagaland Centre has trained around two thousand farmers in scientific management of backyard poultry. With these efforts, improved backyard poultry germplasm has reached the every nook and corner of NEH region including at Indo-Myanmar border. These birds are now households Table 2.
