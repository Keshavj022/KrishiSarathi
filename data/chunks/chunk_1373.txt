 The FFP team also promoted high-quality vegetable varieties to diversify income sources, introducing varieties such as Kashi Sandesh for brinjal, Kashi Ratna for chili, and Kashi Abhiman for tomato to enhance vegetable farming in the region. Fodder crops: In Jhansi, as in other semi-arid regions, livestock farming is commonly used to mitigate climate- related crop risks. Even landless and small farmers often keep at least one cow, buffalo, or a few goats as a reliable source of income. However, livestock feeding practices rely heavily on dry fodder and agricultural waste, with a minimal green component from cut-and-carry grass. Although farmers recognize the benefits of green fodder, adoption rates for fodder crops remained low. To address this, improved varieties such as berseem (BL-10), oat (JHO-822), MP-Chari (sorghum), and the IGFRI-6 variety of Bajra-Napier hybrid grass were promoted. Training on cultivation practices: Farmers received comprehensive training aimed at enhancing their cultivation practices. This training emphasized summer ploughing to break soil compaction and improve moisture retention. Effective application of farmyard manure (FYM) was taught to enrich soil health and promote sustainability. Vermicompost use was also Improved crop varieties at farmerâ€™s field Wheat (RAJ-4079) Brinjal (Kashi Sandesh) Groundnut (TG-37A) Berseem (BL-10) Indian Farming 59 October 2024 promoted, highlighting its benefits in boosting soil fertility and microbial activity. Soil testing was a crucial part of the training, helping farmers identify micronutrient deficiencies, particularly zinc, which was addressed through the application of zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) at 20-25 kg per ha. The training also covered line sowing techniques to optimize plant spacing and light exposure for better growth and yield. Farmers were guided on appropriate seed rates to ensure optimal plant density and competitiveness. The importance of irrigation at critical crop stages was stressed to prevent water stress and maximize productivity. Finally, integrated weed management practices were introduced, equipping farmers with effective weed control strategies while minimizing chemical use. To reinforce these improved agronomic techniques, the FFP conducted demonstrations, allowing farmers to observe and practice these enhanced cultivation methods firsthand. Economic performance of improved varieties Farmers in the selected villages rapidly adopted improved varieties of groundnut, greengram, and wheat, resulting in substantial economic benefits. The adoption of the improved groundnut variety TG 37A led to an impressive yield increase of approximately 26% compared to the local variety (Table 1). Similarly, farmers saw yield gains of 23% for green gram and 13% for wheat, underscoring the effectiveness of these improved varieties in boosting productivity. With the exception of groundnut, the cost of cultivation was significantly lower for the improved greengram and wheat varieties.
