The problem of crop residue burning is intensifying in recent years due to mechanized harvesting of crop, narrow time gap between harvesting of the previous crop and sowing of the next crop and shortage of human labour for removing the crop residues from field. As per the available estimates, burning of crop residues is predominant in northern and central states, namely, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. A Central Sector Scheme on In-situ Crop Residue Management is in operation for the past three years and it has yielded increasing results in reducing the residue burning incidents. There are various ex-situ crop residue management options are available today.
