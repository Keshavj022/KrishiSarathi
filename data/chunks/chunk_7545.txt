 The SNPs located on Chr2 and 6 were validated in F2 and F2:3 phenotyped populations using the SSR primers designed specific to the regions where SNPs are present. The candidate genes (2 each located on Chr 2 and 6) linked to anthracnose fruit rot resistance have been identified. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), could identify two major genomic regions located on chr2 and chr6 as candidate resistance loci associated with anthracnose fruit rot in chilli. A total of 19 SNPs (QTNs; Quantitative Trait Nucleotides) significantly associated with fruit rot resistance (at –log10 (p) value >2.82 for % lesion area), of which five SNPs located on chr2 (physically positioned at 12666827 bp to 141379584 bp) and seven SNPs located on chr6 (physically positioned at 247161384 bp to 252255814) were found highly associated. Resistance related genes within the candidate genomic regions on chr2 (major locus) were searched on pepper pan genome and Cluster of Nucleotide Binding Site-Leucine Rich Repeat (NBS- LRR) domain was found to be involved in disease resistance in plants. The identified SNPs associated with candidate resistance loci are validated in the segregating populations and can be further used in Anthracnose Fruit Rot Resistance (AFRR) breeding program. Utilization and refinement of haploid/doubled haploid induction systems: Three hundred ninety six DHs in rice and more than 800 DHs in maize were evaluated and promising lines were identified for further advancement and use in breeding programme. In case of wheat, 560 DH lines carry rust resistant genes Yr15, Yr5, Yr36 and Lr34, Lr57 in different combinations. Besides, about 150 high tryprophan+high provitamin A maize DH lines were generated and evaluated and promising lines were identified for use in development of biofortified maize hybrids. In rice, significant achievements were made in establishment of in vitro androgenic method in indica rice where callus induction frequency was observed to be 30.4–52% and green shoot regeneration ranged from 61.00 to 85.99%, cumulatively. No haploids were observed among the regenerants, which signifies 100% spontaneous doubling without the treatment of antimitotic agents. Subsequently, application of 5 mg/l of proline to MS media supplemented with NAA (0.1–1.0 mg/l) + Kn (0.5–2.0 mg/l) + BAP (1.0–2.0 mg/l) could enhance the green shoot regeneration by 3.42 times in IR20 x Mahulata followed by 2.44 times in TCN,1.76 times in Arize 6453 and 1.47 times in Arize 8433DT as compared to media devoid of proline; not a single albino was observed in the regenerants. In wheat, application of colchicine for 12 h after pollination (HAP) was found to produce higher doubling percentage as well as a greater number of seed per plant compared to colchicine application for 24 HAP. The frequency of full plant doubling was also high in 12 HAP of colchicine application.
