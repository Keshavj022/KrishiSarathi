 CONCLUSION The study revealed that spreading of parasi leaves once 5-10 days after transplanting @ 100 kg/ha helped in reducing both the rice caseworm infestation and larvae population. Application of parasi leaves showed significantly lower infestation of caseworm than control. â–¡ Contents PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT Code Title of the ITK Description of the ITK Name and address of the discloser Location of use of the ITK Experimenters : 1422 Control of gallfly (Pachydiplosis oryzae) in rice : Gallfly {Pachydiplosis oryzae) is very harmful to rice crop. It damages whole crop of rice. Farmers of Tamar block of Ranchi district in Jharkhand use parso or persu {Cleistanthus collinus) leaves for controlling gallfly. In this practice, fresh leaves of parsu or persu are collected and spread in the infested field without processing. About 10 kg leaves are required for 100 m2 area. These leaves are spread at the initial stage of infestation. This practice controls 70-80% insects. All farmers of the village use this age-old practice. : Shri R.S.

METHODOLOGY Location: Initially the experiment was conducted village Deori, block Tamar, Ranchi (Jharkhand) during kharif 2003-2004, where results have been published in Validation of Indigenous Technical Knowledge in Agriculture Document 3 (2004). The experiment was repeated during kharif 2004-2005 at the same location. It was also conducted for cross validation during kharif 2004 at Central Research Farm of BCKV, Gayeshpur, Nadia, West Bengal. Experiment: The field experiment was Fig. 1. Farmers spreading leaves of Cleistanthus collinus in rice field Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE conducted in rainy (kharif) season of 2003-04 at Deori village in randomized block design with three treatments, viz., T1, control; T2, parso leaf @ 25 kg/ha; and T3, application of carbofuran 3 G @ 15 kg/ha (two doses), having 10 replications. Each treatment covered 2,000 m2. Observations were taken on number of tillers/m2, affected tillers/ m2, infestation (%), and extent of control. During kharif 2004-05, 10 replications were made with four treatments, viz. control, application of parso leaf @ 50 kg/ha, application of parso leaf @ 100 kg/ha and application of carbofuran @ 30 kg/ha. The changes in treatment were made to identify effective dose for control of gallfly. The experiment conducted at Central Research Farm, BCKV had seven replications with three treatments, viz.
