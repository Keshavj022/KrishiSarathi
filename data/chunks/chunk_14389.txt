Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) also demonstrate increased expenses, which are not statistically significant. The type of family structure (nuclear or joint/extended) does not appear to significantly impact total agricultural expenses. The odds ratio of 0.98 suggests no substantial difference in expenses between nuclear and joint/extended families. The gender of the household head is a significant factor influencing agri­ cultural expenses. Female-headed households exhibit 1.62 times higher expenses compared to male-headed households. This statistically sig­ nificant result indicates a gender-based difference in agricultural spending patterns. The education level of the household head does not show a clear pattern of influence on agricultural expenses. The odds ratios for different education categories (illiterate, primary, secondary, and higher secondary and above) are close to 1, indicating that educa­ tion level may not be a decisive factor in determining agricultural ex­ penses. The size of the landholding has a substantial impact on total agricultural expenses. Households with less than 1 acre or more than 1 acre of land exhibit significantly higher remittance expenses, with odds ratios of 4.21 and 4.51, respectively. The odds ratio for Landholding is significant for all the dependent variables with a p-value less than 0.001. These findings suggest that landholding size is a crucial determinant of agricultural expenditure. The duration of migration does not appear to have a significant effect on remittances on total agricultural expenses. The results are not statistically significant. Households receiving re­ mittances monthly show a 1.66 times increase in expenses compared to those who receive remittances only when required. This result is sta­ tistically significant, indicating that the frequency of remittance notably impacts agricultural spending patterns. Finally, the individuals receiving remittances also influence agricultural expenses. Specifically, households with parents are the recipients demonstrating a significant expense increase, with an odds ratio of 1.89. In contrast, when the wife is the receiver, the increase is 1.64 times, but this result is not statisti­ cally significant. This suggests that the recipient of remittances within the household has a varying impact on agricultural spending. 5.
