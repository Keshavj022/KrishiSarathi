 In the standing crop, the broadcasting of the insecticide treated soil 15 DAS be practiced. For this, endosulfan 35EC @ 2.3 Lor chloropyriphos @ 3 L mixed in 50 Kg soil be used for one hectare field.

Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): Assessment of loss due to mites • Crop loss estimation studies indicated that the yellow mite of chilli Polyphagotarsonemus latus causes a yield loss of 28.6% a equivalent to monetary value of Rs. 3261 per hectare at Navsari, while in Byadagi Dabbi variety it is 41.81% loss in yield, in Karnataka, and 49% loss in yield of local chilli varieties like Suryamuki, Beldanga and Bullet in West Bengal. This mite has also been observed to cause a yield loss of 17.61% in Sesamum in Gujarat. Evaluation of yield loss due to the two spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae, indicated that it causes 16.65% loss in yield in brinjal in Ludhiana and 14.03% loss in yield in Varanasi, 18.00% loss in yield in okra in Navsari. In cucumber it causes 52.63% loss in yield in Kalyani. Infestation of Tetranychus sp on marigold reduces the yield of flowers by 39%. In wheat the loss in yield caused by brown mite, Petrobia latens in Punjab is 14.85%. Mite Vector management • The role of eriophyid mite, Aceria cajani as a vector of the virus causing pigeonpea sterility mosaic disease was confirmed following successful transmission of the virus by stapling mite infested diseased leaflets on to the healthy seedlings. Studies on spatial distribution of vector mites on pigeonpea plant ascertained their preference for trifoliate leaves in the top canopy. Within a branch also, the trifoliate leaves at the tip harboured more number of mites. In a leaflet, basal half recorded relatively more number of vector mites. Application of profenophos 0.02% between 30 and 45 days after sowing effectively controlled the vector mite leading to significant reduction in the incidence of sterility mosaic disease. Biological control using predatory mites and acaropathogens • Neoseiulus longispinosus suppressed the population of T. urticae on rose in 2‐3 weeks.Studies on the role of plant architecture on predatory efficiency of Neoseiulus longispinosus revealed that bushy nature of plants aid in faster suppression of spider www.icar.org.in 109 2002 ‐ 2007 mites.
