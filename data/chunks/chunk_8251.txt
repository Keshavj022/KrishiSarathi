Ajmer Dill-2 Drumstick (Moringa oleifera), Thar Harsha, is late maturing type (harvesting from April-June, i.e. 160- 180 days after sowing). Pods are green and straight (1 m long). It is drought hardy and resistant to leaf eating caterpillar and moderately resistant to fruit fly under field condition. Pod yield is 45-48 kg/ plant. Leaves are suitable for both vegetable and fodder purpose. Potato Kufri Mohan has been recommended for release. This variety produces attractive white-cream, ovoid, uniform tubers and is suitable for northern and eastern plains of the country. Medium maturing (90 days) variety, suitable for fresh consumption. With mealy texture, pleasant flavour and free from discolouration after cooking, it produces high tuber yield (35-40 tonnes/ ha). It is resistant to late blight (Phytophthora infestans) and recommended for cultivation in Indo-Gangetic plains. CROP IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 55 Further, based on consistently good performance over the years, seven advanced breeding lines (hybrids) namely J/8-85, J/8-91, J/8-119, PS/09-16, PS/09-9 (table purposes); MP/9-28 (chips) and HT/07-1329 (heat stress) were identified for multi-location trials. Tuber crops Greater yam clone, Dah-9/196, produced highest yield (30.2 tonnes/ha), followed by Da-293 under non- trailing conditions. Among white yam hybrids, Drh- 1150, produced highest tuber yield (61.70 tonnes/ha), followed by Drh-1125 (59.70 t/ha). The dwarf white yam hybrids, viz. Drd-1038, Drd-1110, Drd-1835, Drd- 920, Drd-1089 and Drd-1078 had excellent cooking quality. Ornamental crops Two hybrids, Arka Manorama and Arka Aayush, of gladiolus were released. Vallabh Isabgol 1 Medicinal and aromatic plants Isabgol, Vallabh Isabgol-1, is a high-yielding (12 q/ha) medium-duration (120-125 days) variety, recommended for cultivation in semi-arid regions of India. ❑ 6. Livestock Improvement Cattle Frieswal Project: The strength of elite cows at various Military Farms was 1,176 which has increased by 6% from previous year (1,111). Out of the 8 bulls inducted for the genetic evaluation in 2006, five exceeded the herd average and the top ranking bull had 3.97% genetic superiority over the population mean.
