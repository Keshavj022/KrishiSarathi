 Under National FMD Serosurveillance, 68,948 bovine serum samples collected at random from various parts of the country were tested in r3AB3 NSP-ELISA for assessing the prevalence of NSP-antibody (NSP- Ab) positive animals, which is an indicator of FMD virus exposure regardless of vaccination status. The test revealed overall seropositivity in ~ 23.41% samples/ animals, which is comparatively lesser than the previous yearâ€™s average (29.2%). The percentage protective antibody titre (SP antibody) in the serum samples collected at random from FMD-CP states were higher when compared to the other states. During the reported period, 191,402 pre- and post- vaccinated serum samples were tested under FMD Control Programme (FMDCP). Of these 90,244 serum samples were from first phase (2003-04) FMDCP districts representing XVI, XVII and XVIII phases of vaccinations, and remaining 101,158 serum samples were from expanded FMDCP districts of 2010 representing Phases VI and VII. Currently, 89, 78.6 and 87.1% of animals tested were having protective (log10 1.8 and above) antibody level against serotypes O, A and Asia 1, respectively, in post-vaccination serum samples in the initial FMDCP (2003-04) districts. Similarly in the expanded FMDCP districts (2010), 93.2, 89.5 and 89.7% of animals tested had protective antibody level against serotypes O, A and Asia1, respectively in post-vaccination serum samples. Avian influenza Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 viruses: Avian influenza H5N8 viruses were isolated from water fowls for the first time in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and Kerala in October 2016. One representative isolate each from National Zoological Park, New Delhi and Gandhi Zoological Park, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh were processed for genome sequencing and analysis. Based on the presence of multibasic cleavage site (PLREKRRKR/GLF) in the haemagglutinin (HA) gene, the virus can be categorized as highly pathogenic to poultry. These viruses belong to the new phylogenetic clade 2.3.4.4, and are closely related to the H5N8 viruses isolated from wild birds in Russian Federation suggesting dispersal of virus during southward winter migration of birds. Antigenic analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses: Antigenic analysis of HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from poultry during 2006 to 2015 in India comprising 25 isolates from four phylogenetic clades, 2.2 (01 isolate), 2.2.2.1 (01 isolate), 2.3.2.1a (17 isolates) and 2.3.2.1c (06 isolates) was carried out. Seven H5N1 isolates from all four clades were selected for production of chicken antiserum, and antigenic analysis was carried out. The data indicated antigenic divergence (6-21 fold reduction in cross-reactivity) between the two recently emerged clades 2.3.2.1a and 2.3.2.1c. A systematic analysis of antigenic drift of the contemporary strains will help to determine the strain(s) suitable for vaccine candidate.
