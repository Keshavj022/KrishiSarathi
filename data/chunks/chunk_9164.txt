More indigenous breeds are being included. BREEDS AND STRAINS Crossbreeding with improved exotic breeds has been adopted to improve the low-productivity of the Indian breeds. In cattle, new genotypes KARAN SWISS, KARAN FRIES and FRIESWAL have been evolved. They are continuously being improved upon through selection and progeny testing. KARAN SWISS (BROWN SWISS x RED SINDHI or SAHIWAL) and KARAN FRIES (FRIESIAN x THARPARKAR) crossbreds at the NDRI, Karnal, are giving an annual lactation of 3,385 and 3,820 litres. The first lactation yield of FRIESWAL (HOLSTEIN x SAHIWAL) has been 2,832 litres of milk, at the Military Farm, Meerut, which is around 4,000 litres in mature lactation. At the Central Sheep and Wool Research Institute (CSWRI), AVIKALIN (RAMBOUILLET x MALPURA, 50%), producing 2 kg of superior carpet wool per annum; AVIVASTRA (RAMBOUILLET/MERINO x NALI/CHOKLA, >50% exotic) producing 2.5 kg of apparel wool per annum and BHARAT MERINO (RAMBOUILLET/ MERINO x native, 75% exotic) yielding 2.9 kg greasy wool with 19 micron fibre diameter have been evolved.
