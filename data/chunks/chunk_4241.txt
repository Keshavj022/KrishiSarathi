 The variety has got moderate field resistance against bacterial wilt disease and field tolerance against fruit and shoot borer. This variety has been released by the State Variety Release Committee, West Bengal and notified by the Central Variety Release Committee for State release during 2022. This variety performed well in eastern parts of India apart from West Bengal. Research Arup Chattopadhyay*, Asit Kumar Mandal, Subrata Dutta, Subhradeep Pramanik and Pranab Hazra Fruits of Bidhan Suphala Indian Horticulture 10 quality produce. Spray the young seedlings with 0.2% chlorothalonil + 0.1% carbendazim/L to control damping off in the seed bed. Alternate spray with imidachloprid @ 3 ml/10 L and acetamiprid @ 0.15% is effective to control the vector population of little leaf disease and jassids. Spray the crop with copper oxychloride @ 0.3% to control Phomopsis blight disease. Nipping off of the withering shoots and picking up the bored fruits twice or thrice in a week and burying them deep into the soil, installation of pheromone trap in the field, and need based alternate spray with spinosad (0.15 ml/l) or flubendiamide @ 0.05% are effective to manage fruit and shoot borer.

Generally 20-25 days fruits after anthesis are optimally matured for harvest. Fruits are harvested with stalk at joint. Based on State and National trials over three years (2013-14 to 2015-16), the average yield of Bidhan Suphala is 307.46 q/ha (Table 2).
