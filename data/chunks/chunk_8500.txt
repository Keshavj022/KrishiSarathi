 Mungbean lines Pusa 105, Pusa 9871 and UPM 78-1 are identified as resistant to root-knot nematode. Rhizobium strain CRM 6 proved as most effective, followed by PMR 2001 in mungbean. And in urdbean, PUR 34 and PUR 16 performed better. LENTIL AND FIELDPEA A new lentil variety NDL 94, a pedigree selection from DLG 105 × PL 406, has been identified for eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa. It has small seeds with an average yield of 1.52 tonnes/ha. The variety possesses resistance to rust. Seed rate of 75 kg/ha resulted in higher grain yield of bold-seeded varieties in northern states. In utera cultivation, 2 hr of seed soaking in 2% KH2PO4 was effective with 9% higher yield. In fieldpea, 2 sprays of Mancozeb (0.25%) were effective in controlling rust and 2 sprays of wettable sulphur (0.3%) in controlling powdery mildew. Fieldpea HUP 15, HUD 16, KSP 22, KPMR 144-1, KPMR 557, DPFPD 8, DPFPD 62 and JP 181 have showed tolerance to rust in Uttar Pradesh. ARID LEGUMES Crop Improvement Cowpea GC 9714 has yielded 10.50% (1 tonne/ha) higher over the better check GC 3 (0.79 tonne/ha) in the multilocation trial. It flowers in 47 days and takes 72 days to mature. Mothbean CZM 45 has yielded 32.2% (0.59 tonne/ha) higher over the corresponding check CAZRI Moth 1 (0.45 tonne/ha) in the all-India co-ordinated trials. This flowers in 40 days and yields 26.13% crude protein. In guar genotypes HGS 365, GG 1 and HGS 880, maximum galactomannan gum (31.2%) and endosperm (38.45%) contents, and means viscosity profile (3726 Cp), respectively, were observed. Crop Production At Hisar and Bawal, 0.5% ZnSO4 spray at 25 and 45days after sowing (DAS) gave 69% yield (1.7 tonnes/ha) increment in guar yield over control (1.05 tonnes/ha). Spray of 0.5% ZnSO4 + 0.5% FeSO4 on cowpea at 45 DAS proved quite effective at Pattambi, wherein grain yield increased by about 44.9% over control (0.42 tonne/ha). Crop Protection Guar entry HGS 870 was found resistant (less than 10% infection) to bacterial leaf blight (BLB), and GAUG 12 and HGS 885 showed less than 3% infection against Alternaria leaf blight. Seven cowpea entries TC 101, TC 102, TCM 77-4, DCP 3, DCP 4, V 649 and HC 98-50 are found free free from YMV. l Fieldpea genotypes HUP 15, HUD 16, KSP 22 showed tolerance to rust in Uttar Pradesh. l Mothbean CZM 45 yielded 32.2% higher over CAZRI Moth 1, the check. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 40 COMMERCIAL CROPS COTTON Crop Improvement Intra-hirsutum cotton hybrid NCHH 207 for irrigated areas of South Zone and intra- arboreum hybrid ADCH 1 for rainfed areas of Central Zone have been identified for release. Genotypes of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) GJHV 370, LH 1948, PH 348, NH 545 and H 1252 for irrigated areas and LH 1948, NH 545, Khd.122, CNH 155 and KH 11 for rainfed areas have showed promise. LH 1948 and NH 545 are found suitable for rainfed and irrigated areas. Genotypes identified for salt tolerance are LRK 516, PKV 081, Khandwa 3, Badnawar (G.
