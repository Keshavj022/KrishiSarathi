   Oil palm based inter-cropping systems in mature plantations with Cocoa, red ginger, heliconia, bush pepper, long pepper, mango ginger, banana, ornamental crops enhanced CB ratio from 1:2.38 to 1:2.86.   Developed oil palm based mixed farming system with fodder crops, dairy & back yard poultry (CB ratio - 1:3.28).   Training programmes on oil palm cultivation were organized for 3500 officers and 36000 farmers.   Published Mobile Apps (23), short video films (6) on different aspects of oil palm cultivation. yy Multiplication of quality planting material for enhanced area under oil palm: Production of oil palm sprouts by ICAR for area coverage 2021-22 2017-18 to 2021-22 Number of germinated seeds (lakhs) 2.56 13.35 Area spread (ha) 1423 7896 Revenue generated (Rs. lakhs) 76.86 454.51 Saving of foreign exchange (Rs. lakhs) 204.8 1068.0 11 DARE–ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2021-22 4. Climate Resilience Indian Agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change. As per the latest IPCC AR-6 Report, increase in rainfall, high inter-annual variability, intense and frequent heat waves, likely temperature increase by 1.5 to 4.0oC, and rise in sea level by 300 mm could be the major challenges for sustainable agriculture in the coming years. Bringing climate resilience by developing and adopting appropriate adaptation techniques is the mechanism to cope with the changing climate. Breeding stress tolerant varieties and supplementing them with proven NRM technologies and contingent preparedness could effectively mitigate the vulnerabilities of crops to weather abnormalities. The major achievement of ICAR during 2021-22 towards bringing climate resilience to farm sector are highlighted below: yy 322 of total 389 varieties released during 2021-22 are tolerant to one or more biotic and abiotic stresses. These include 15 climate resilient varieties tolerant to traits like water logging, drought, heat, salinity etc. A total of 14 such varieties released and notified during 2021-22. yy Developed a new rice variety for coastal saline tracts of Odisha (CR Dhan 412/NICRA Dhan). yy Identified submergence tolerant rice varieties (Swarna Sub1, Ranjith Sub1, Ratnagiri-1, 5, 7, MTU-1061) to minimize the impact of flood on yields by 70% over farmer’s practice. yy Undertaken 829 demonstrations, 613 capacity building programmes and 110 extension activities on various climate resilient technologies. yy Developed a mobile app for accessing information on risk and vulnerability at district level for adaptation planning. yy Climate resilient villages established in 151 vulnerable districts involving one lakh farm families; 45 new villages added. yy Updated 15 district agriculture contingency plans. Organized seven interface meetings with department of agriculture of state Governments i.e. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha, Telangana, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan to enhance the preparedness of state Governments to delayed/deficit/excess rainfall situations.
