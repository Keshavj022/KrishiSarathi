 Heterogeneous impacts Given that the adoption of new technologies is associated with upfront fixed costs and scale effects (Foster and Rosenzweig, 2010), I test for heterogeneity in treatment effects by farm size. Using the within-district gross cultivated land distribution at baseline, I split the sample into two subgroups – below and above median cultivators – and fully interact Eq. (8) with a binary variable that takes the value 1 if a household is an above median cultivator at baseline. As shown in Appendix Table B12, effects are largely concentrated among small- scale (below median) cultivators — I find a significant extensive margin response in non-cereal cultivation (row 1, column 1), substantial take up of non-cereal high-yielding varieties (row 1, column 2) and a significant increase in investments in material inputs and farm labor (row 1, columns 3 to 9). As before, this increase in farm labor is driven by a significant increase in the number of labor-days hired per acre of cultivated land (row 1, column 8). I find no detectable impact for above median cultivators — none of the p-values from the F-test of joint significance are less than 0.1. Baseline non-cereal cultivation and usage of agricultural inputs are much higher for this subgroup; this suggests that small-scale cultivators are more likely to be constrained in making productive investments in agriculture in the presence of poor infrastructure. 6.5. Robustness checks Placebo test. To further validate the parallel trends assumption un- derlying my difference-in-differences framework, I conduct a placebo test where I define 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡to be an indicator that equals 1 if the program- eligible village received a program road between 2007–2010. I drop all villages that received a program road prior to 2007; the relevant control group in this set up thus consists of program-eligible villages that received program roads after 2010. If villages that were treated earlier by the program were on differential trends from those that were treated later by the program, I would expect to see significant effects for the placebo treatment group. Table 7 summarizes the results from this placebo test. Other than the indicators for non-cereal cultivation and HYV use in villages far away from towns, the remaining coefficients are not statistically significant at standard levels, further supporting the pre-trends assumption underlying the difference-in-differences analysis. Accounting for multiple hypothesis testing. Given that a large number of outcome variables are considered in the analysis, I address concerns about multiple hypothesis testing following the approach in Kling et al. (2007). I construct standardized indices for four main families of outcome variables — staple crop cultivation, crop diversification, farm inputs and market activity — using components from Tables 4 through Table 6.
