 The irrigation schedule may however be changed suitably based on the soil conditions. Integrated pest management is the best option for management of FAW viz., summer ploughing, growing single cross hybrids, clean cultivation, intercropping with pulses, balanced application of fertilizers, release of egg parasitoids (Trichogrammasp) and as a last resort spray Chlorantraniliprole @ 0.4 ml or Spinetoram @ 0.5 ml or Emamectin benzoate @ 0.4 g/l of water in plant whorls. For Post Flowering Stalk Rots, invariably to go for crop rotation, removing plant debris, summer ploughing, application of balanced K fertilizer, avoiding moisture stress after flowering and growing tolerant hybrids should be followed. For zero tillage maize Dibble the seed after harvesting Vanakalam rice at 2-3 cm depth, in optimum moisture, or else, give light irrigation before dibbling depending on the soil type. Spraying of Combination of Gramoxone 1.0 l/ac and Atrazine 1.0 kg/ac can also be used for controlling re-growth of rice stubbles and broad-leaved weeds. Groundnut Seed treatment: Seed treatment with Tebuconazole @ 1g or Mancozeb @ 3g per kg of seed. At places where stem rot is common, treat the seeds with Imidacloprid (600 F.S) @ 1 ml in 7 ml of water per kg of seed before sowing. Wherever severe root grub incidence is common, seed treatment should be done with Chlorpyriphos @ 6.5 ml before sowing. For newly sown Groundnut fields or Groundnut sown under previous paddy fields, treat the seeds with ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 368 Rhizobium culture @ 200 g. per kgs of seed for 1 acre. At places where dry root rot and stem rot is common treat the seed with Trichoderma @ 10 g. per kg of seed for better control. For efficient weed control, spray pre-emergence herbicides such as Alachlor @ 1litre or Pendimethalin (30% EC) @ 1.30-1.60 litres per 200 liters of water, immediately after sowing or 2-3 days after sowing. Inter cultivation should be done 25-30 days after sowing. Maintain weed free conditions in the field up to 45 days after sowing. To control Spodoptera, install 4-5 Pheromone traps per acre. Spray 5% NSKE solution to control early-stage larvae. To control later stage larvae spray Novaluron @ 200ml or Flubendiamide @ 400 ml per 200 liters of water per acre. Use Poison bait pellets prepared with rice bran 5 kg + Jaggery 0.5 kg + 500 ml Monochrotophos and broadcast them in field at evening hours. To manage Tikka leaf spot, spray Chlorothalonil @ 400 g. or Tebuconazole @ 200 ml per 200 litre per acre. To control leaf folder Spray Chlorpyriphos @ 500 ml or Acephate @ 300 g per 200 liters of water per acre. Chickpea Sowing should be done in rows with spacing of 30 x 10 cm to maintain optimum plant population of 30-35 plants /sq.mt. to get good yields. Use of Wilt resistant varieties suitable for mechanical harvesting JG-11, JAKI- 9218, NBeG-3, NBeg-47.
