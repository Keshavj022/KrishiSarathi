 The sorbent was sandwiched between two micro­ porous polyethersulfone (PES) membranes (0.1 μm pore size, 90 mm, outside diameter, Pall Corporation) and secured tightly with two stainless steel rings (90 mm, outside diameter) and three screws. POCIS devices were deployed in triplicate for 28 days, from April 20th to May 24th, 2022, in six borewells of the Berambadi catchment at depths ranging from 30 to 75 m depending on the local groundwater table depth (Fig. 1). Due to the unavailability of on-site monitoring in­ struments, groundwater characteristics such as pH, depth, and other parameters could not be recorded during this study. Consequently, our analysis primarily focused on location-based observations. J. Masbou et al. Journal of Hazardous Materials 488 (2025) 137428 3 2.4. Profenofos extraction and analytical methods 2.4.1. Profenofos extraction from water, soil and POCIS Profenofos was extracted from water using a liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) method. Aqueous solutions ranging from 1 mL (volatilisation experiment) to 10 mL (photolysis experiment) were extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) in 15 mL Falcon centrifuge tubes. The LLE procedure involves adding 3 mL of EtOAc, vortexing for 30 s, and centrifugation at 4000 rpm (2473 RCF) for at least 5 min or until phase separation. The EtOAc supernatant phase was carefully transferred to an amber glass vial, and the extraction procedure was repeated twice. The extracts were then evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen (grade 4.5) and reconstituted in 0.5 mL of ACN. A test to assess potential loss of profenofos during evaporation revealed no significant reduction in profenofos levels. Recovery rates are provided in Table S-3 and S-4. Profenofos was extracted from soil samples using a previously described modified ultrasonic-assisted extraction protocol [33], with the modification that 5–10 g of soils were placed in an amber glass centri­ fuge tube prior to the addition of 1 mL of EtOAc per gram of sample. The POCIS extraction procedure was adapted from [34]. Each POCIS was carefully opened, and the sorbent was transferred into an empty solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge, which was sealed on both sides with HDPE frits (AFFINISEP or Thermo Scientific). The samples were then processed using a SPE method [33,34]. Cartridges were dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen for 20 min, and pesticides were eluted (5 mL. min−1) using successively 5 mL of EtOAc and 5 mL ACN. The extracts were evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen and reconstituted in 0.5 mL of ACN. 2.4.2. Profenofos quantification Profenofos and its transformation product, 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol, were quantified with a gas chromatograph (GC, Trace 1300, 172 Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with a mass spectrometer (MS, ISQ™, Thermo Fisher 173 Scientific) [35]. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a TG –5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µ film thicknesses).
