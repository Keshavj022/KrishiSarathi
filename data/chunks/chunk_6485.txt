 Climate-smart interventions to reduce GHG emissions in adopted villages: A village Momanpur in the Bhopal district of Madhya Pradesh was selected to introduce crop-specific climate smart technologies to mitigate the climate variability and climate change. The village comprises of 30 farmer families and total agricultural land is approximately 152 acres with major crops like rice and soybean in the kharif season, while wheat and chickpea in the rabi season. Several climate- smart interventions for rice, chickpea, wheat, soybean, and greengram have been identified for the NICRA- adopted village Momanpur using the CCAF-mitigation option tools. Adaptation and mitigation potential of different cropping system/farming system: To assess the quantum of greenhouse gases emission from rice- wheat cropping system under the influence of different organic carbon strata (Medium and High) along with different establishment techniques and various sources of nitrogen, a field experiment was conducted during the year of 2020-21 at Modipuram under irrigated conditions. It was found that global warming potential (GWP) increased by 3.9% in zero tillage plot as compared to conventional practice under higher carbon strata. However, under medium carbon strata, it increased by 21.5%. The crop productivity was reduced to the tune of 8.3 and 4.4% in zero tillage practice as compared to conventional practice injunction with recommended Climate-smart options for NICRA-adopted village Momanpur Crop Farmer practices Intervention-1 Intervention-2 Intervention-3 Rice Puddling + N 120 kg, P2O5 60 kg and K2O 60 kg + residue burning (8080) Puddling + N 120 kg, P2O5 60 kg and K2O 60 kg + no residue burning (7327) Puddling + N 120 kg, P2O5 60 kg and K2O 60 kg+ multiple drainage + short drainage + no burning (3583) Reduce tillage + N 120 kg, P2O5 60 kg and K2O 60 kg+ multiple drainage + long drainage + residue not burned (2073) Chickpea Two tillage + N 40 kg + P2O5 60 kg + residue not burned (711.8) One tillage + N 40 kg + P2O5 60 kg + residue not burned (354) No-tillage + N 40 kg + P2O5 60 kg + residue not burned (104) No tillage + N 40 kg + P2O5 60 kg + residue incorporation 2.5 ton + residue not burned (86.2) Wheat Two tillage + N 130 kg, P2O5 and K2O 60 kg each + residue burning (2367) Two tillage + N 120 kg, P2O5 and K2O 60 kg each + no residue burning (1487) Reduce tillage + N 120 kg, P2O5 and K2O 60 kg each + no residue burning (1129) No-tillage + N 120 kg, P2O5 and K2O 60 kg each + no residue burning (879) Soybean Two tillage + N 40 kg, P2O5 60 and K2O 20 kg + no residue burning (1111) One tillage + N 40 kg, P2O5 60 and K2O 20 kg + no residue burning (753) No-tillage + N 40 kg, P2O5 60 and K2O 20 kg + no residue burning (503) No-tillage + N 40 kg, P2O5 60 and K2O 20 kg + no residue burning + residue 2.
