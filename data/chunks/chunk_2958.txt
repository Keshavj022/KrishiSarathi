 There is also a need for extension research by ICAR research institutes and SAUs to suggest innovative approaches and methodologies to KVKs for critical assessment of location specific technologies, frontline demonstrations, and effective capacity building of stakeholders, vocational training, and entrepreneurship development and for up-scaling successful experiences. (Action: all VCs/KVKs/Zonal Coordinators) 6 Agenda 3: NAIP Activities ND, NAIP presented the agenda and reviewed the progress so far in all four components of NAIP.

It is read write platform where anybody can submit any worthwhile information on any aspects of the crop. It aims to bring together a community practice through an ICT mediated knowledge creating and organizing platform with an effort to leverage the existing agricultural extension system. It is envisioned to be a one stop shop for all kinds of information related to Indian agriculture. The practice of crop knowledge models (KMs) has been defined and developed for the first time worldwide to create architecture for accumulating known codified and approved information about crops, with the support of FAO, Rome. The knowledge models of Chickpea, Pigeonpea, Sorghum and Groundnut are developed at ICRISAT, Wheat, Sugarcane, Litchi and Vegetable pea are developed at GBPUAT and Rice is developed at IITK. The agricultural scientists are requested to enrich this platform by their knowledge and expertise. (Action: ICAR Directors/VCs/SMDs) Agenda 5.1: ARS/NET Examination and Performance of ARS Dr M.J. Modayil, Member, ASRB, New Delhi presented some significant trends in the performance of SAUs on the basis of the data for last 18 years. Students from some of the newly established universities have shown good promise in certain subjects. How this success can be replicated in other 7 departments of the same university and how other SAUs can benefit from the example of selected bright spots, needs discussion. Further, the board is in the process of making changes in the grouping of subjects for purpose of NET examination which will serve preliminary examination for ARS.
