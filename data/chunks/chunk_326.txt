 NABARD also showcased millet products’ commercial potential to farmers, FPOs, and SHG members at the IGKV Agri Export Summit in 2022, promoting their significance in the market. SUMMARY Millet cultivation in Chhattisgarh has faced several challenges in recent years, including low demand, lack of knowledge and infrastructure and competition from other crops. However, millets continue to be an important crop for the State’s food security and cultural heritage. With the launch of government schemes and policies, including the Millet Mission, Chhattisgarh has taken significant steps towards promoting millet cultivation and improving the livelihoods of farmers. Encouraging the cultivation and consumption of millets in Chhattisgarh will not only provide nutritional benefits to the population but also contribute towards sustainable agriculture and food security. *Corresponding author e-mail: surendra.babu@nabard.org Table 4.
