In west‐coast region, the performance of forage maize + cowpea was superior (65‐ 136 %) in terms of green forage yield ( 198 q/ha) in rice fallow than sorghum and pearlmillet in sole stands and intercropping with cowpea. 6. Forage seed production • In arid region, the spray of Thiourea @ 0.05% to Lasiurus sindicus increases the seed yield by 13‐15 per cent over Gibberelic acid (10 ppm) and control. • The semi spreading type forage cowpea cv. Bundel Lobia‐1 with narrow spacing of 30 cm produces 17 per cent higher seed yield as compared to other popular cultivars of cowpea viz., IGFRI‐95( erect type), UPC‐9202 & UPC‐4200 ( spreading type). Location wise, forage cowpea varieties like Bundel Lobia ‐1 at Rahuri, Jhansi and Hisar; UPC‐9202 at Pantnagar and Hyderabad; UPC‐4200 at Jabalpur and Bhubaneswar were superior for seed yield. 7. Forage production under plantation crops • In South zone, Guinea grass + Desmenthus (3:1) intercropped in Banana plantation produces higher green fodder (1984.3 q/ha) and realizes highest net monetary return (Rs. 93558/ha/yr) than other combinations of forages in banana orchard. Similarly, coconut + www.icar.org.in 36 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science Guinea grass + Desmenthus (3:1) in intercropping system realizes highest net monetary return (Rs. 55612/ha/yr) in this agro climatic situations. • Production potential of guinea grass under shade was also promising at Coimbatore and Vellayani (under coconut) and Jorhat (under Machilis bombycina). The reduction in green forage yield was 17.4, 15.9 and 15.9 per cent only over open at Coimbatore, Vellayani and Jorhat, respectively. However, at Bhubaneswar condition, the forage yield of guinea grass increased by 6 % under coconut than open. 3 ( C ) Forage Protection Technology • In cowpea, seed treatment with carbendazim @ 2g/kg, followed by two sprays of neem seed kernal extract @ 3% in 30 and 45 days crop is the most economical and productive measure for managing pests in an integrated manner. • In Lucerne, soil treatment with carbofuran 3G @1g/m row along with seed treatment of carbendazim @ 1.0 g/kg and spray with neem seed kernal extract @ 3% , 15 days after each cut provides maximum fodder yield (381.9 q/ha) but economically seed treatment with carbendazim @1g/kg has been found most viable (C:B 53.43) than the other treatments studied. • In Berseem, soil treatment with carbofuran @ 3G@1g/m row along with seed treatment with carbendazim @ 1g/kg provides maximum forage yield (518.89 q/ha) but economically seed treatment with neem seed powder@ 50g/ kg has been found most viable (C:B 50.95) than the other treatments studied. • For white clover disease management, seed treatment with Trichoderma @5g/kg and alternate spray of cantaf and karathane @ 0.05% at 15 days and 7 days was economical. www.icar.org.in 37 2002 ‐ 2007 All India Coordinated Research Project on Groundnut 1.
