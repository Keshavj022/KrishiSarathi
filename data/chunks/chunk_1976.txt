New license authorization for UL(M2M) and UL-VNO(M2M) under UL and UL-VNO is required for entities providing services exclusively through the LPWAN or equivalent technologies using unlicensed band or obtain licensed spectrum to provide M2M services exclusively. f. M2M SPs and WPAN/WLAN connectivity providers are required to mandatorily connect to licensed telecom operators network for backhaul connectivity. 10. TEC is the nodal authority for Mandatory Testing and Certification of Telecommunication Equipment (MTCTE). Every telecom equipment must undergo mandatory testing and certification in respect of parameters as determined by the telegraph authority from time to time prior to sale, import of use in India. The testing of telecom products to be carried out by TEC accredited testing labs as per the Essential Requirements (ER) prepared for corresponding device under MTCTE regime. loT devices hardware will be tested as per Essential Requirements (ERs) under MTCTE having testing specifications related to EMC, Safety, communication interfaces, IP, SAR and Security. loT/M2M devices such as loT gateway, tracking device, environment end point monitoring device have been covered under mandatory testing and certification w.e.f. 01.01.2024. Smart Electricity meters will fall under mandatory testing and certification w.e.f. 01.04.2024. Security specifications i.e ITSARs (Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements) which are also the part of ERs, are being prepared by NCCS (National Centre for Communication Security), Bengaluru. 11. TEC released standard on Fairness Assessment and Rating of Artificial Intelligence Systems in 2022. This Standard enumerates detailed procedures for accessing and rating artificial intelligence systems for fairness. Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in all domains including telecommunication and related ICT for making decisions that may affect our day-to-day lives. Any unintended bias in the Al systems could have grave consequences. This standard provides a systemic approach to certifying fairness for Al systems. (https://www.tec.gov.
