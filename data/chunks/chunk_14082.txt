 We tried to use the most commonly and robust indicators; however, it should be noted that sustainability indicators are very dynamic like the concept of sustainability. Thus future researchers, depending on the scope of their research, can use other indicators to design and validate agricultural sustainability index. Lastly, this study does not capture the farm-level impacts, does not take into account more nuanced physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of agricultural systems, and is not able to use a continuous set of data to understand the time-series nature of advances in agricultural sustainability.
