Social Science ASRB-Online Application and Scorecard Information System (ASRB-OASIS) ASRB-OASIS application (http://www.asrb.org.in/) was developed for inviting online applications for the RMP positions at ASRB level. System has the provision to auto-compute the scores based on information filled for different positions. Applications were invited online for various RMP positions (DDG/ADG/Directors) using this system. System was also developed for inviting application for Non-RMP positions. Information Systems/Portals/MobileApps yy IVRI Online Vet Clinic App was developed by ICAR-IASRI in collaboration with ICAR-IVRI. The app is targeted to impart knowledge and skills to Graduating Veterinarians & Field Veterinary Officers about most frequent clinical conditions encountered in field conditions related to medicine. id=com.icar.ivri.
