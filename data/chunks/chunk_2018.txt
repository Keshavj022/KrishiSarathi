Appendix Appendix 1: Actor / Business Role S Actor Business role No 1. Field We collected images of an experimental wheat field of the Experimentati HD 3059 variety located at the research farm of Indian on and UAV Council of Agricultural Research-Indian Agricultural Image Research Institute (ICAR-IARI) (28°38'28.314"N latitude Acquisition and 77°9'3.106"E longitude) 228 m above mean sea level. The wheat field consisted of three replications of fifteen plots (7.2 x 13 m size each), maintained at five graded TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 93 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 94 nitrogen levels (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha−1), and three irrigation treatments (soil moisture sensor-based treatment (I1); crop water stress index (CWSI)-based treatment (I2); and conventional treatment (I3)) 2. Pre- processing Includes resizing, normalization, noise reduction 3. Augmentation Flipping, Rotation, Zooming, Brightness adjustments 4. PROSAIL Simulations and Model Evaluation The simulated dataset from PROSAIL RTM was used for retrieving wheat biophysical traits. PROSAIL is a combined RTM of the PROSPECT-4 leaf reflectance model and the 4-SAIL canopy reflectance model 5. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) First, it provides an additional quantitative measurement of prediction accuracy in terms of uncertainty estimates (σ). A lower σ indicates a better prediction for crop traits.
