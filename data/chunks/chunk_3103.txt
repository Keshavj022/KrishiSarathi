In order to reduce the import cost, borax penta hydrate in its granular form (known as “Granubor II”), was developed and tested as one of the boron sources for soil application in crop production under contractual research project Network Sponsored by M/S Rallis Research Centre, Bangalore. Total 26 field trials were conducted in eight states through state agricultural universities/ ICAR institute Treatment at 75, 100 and 125% of the optimum dose to respective crops were applied through soil application by Granubor II and crystalline borax decahydrate. Crops were raised by adopting all standard agronomic practices. Boron control 0.75 kg B /ha Fig. 5.1 Effect of boron fertilization on cauliflower in alfisols of Himachal Pradesh • In 80‐85% experiments, crops showed response to added boron. Optimum response of crops to boron rates found limited either to 75% or 100% of the recommended dose in most of the field trials . Thus, crops need 0.50 to 1.00 kg boron ha‐1. Soil application of 125% boron generally caused deleterious effect. Thus, considering residual effect of B it is advisable not to apply higher doses of boron and only judicious use of 0.5‐0.75 kg B ha‐1 annually will be beneficial in sustaining higher crop productivity ( Table 5.1).

Thus considering the benefits accrued from above sources borax penta hydrate has been notified in the Fertilizer (Control) Order (FCO) 1985 vide amendment order notification under section 3 of the Essential Commodity Act, 1955 of Govt. of India for agricultural use . 4.2 Seed treatment as an option for enhancing NUE and correcting micronutrient deficiencies • Amelioration of micronutrient is becoming a costly affair. The use efficiency of micronutrient is very low. So seed treatment is one of the promising techniques to enhance use efficiency of micronutrient.
