15. For optimal survival at the farmers’ end, the minimum size for saleable seeds should exceed 5 cm. It is imperative to disseminate information regarding the availability of these seeds to other farmers through channels such as newspapers, brochures, posters, and social media, leveraging the power of free advertisements within the farming community. Additionally, on-site delivery services can be extended if farmers acquire at least 2,000 seeds or more, particularly within the same district. Agriculture magazines can serve as effective platforms for promoting this news, and farmers are encouraged to explore innovative methods for marketing their produce at a premium price, bypassing intermediaries. The successful buy-back arrangements and marketing models demonstrated by ICAR-KVK Ernakulam in the Ernakulam region are viable examples supporting agencies can adopt. SUMMARY The innovative pond system approach for pearlspot seed production, introduced by ICAR-KVK, Ernakulam, emerges as a promising solution to bridge the gap between demand and supply. Overcoming challenges like low fecundity and intricate breeding behaviours, this method offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional hatchery systems. The emphasis on water quality management, predator control, and efficient harvesting techniques contributes to the success of sustainable pearlspot aquaculture. The economic feasibility and marketing strategies presented provide valuable insights for farmers, ensuring optimal seed production and dissemination in the market. *Corresponding author email: vikaspattath@gmail.com and 60 mm mesh high-density polyethylene (HDPE) nets. Similarly, the pond-side walls are covered with 2.5 mm wide and 30 mm mesh HDPE nets to prevent otters’ entry. Pest control and water quality The existence of the ectoparasite Caligus minimus poses a substantial threat to pearlspot seed production. To mitigate this risk, it is crucial to uphold optimal water quality. Additionally, careful broodstock selection is essential to ensure that the brood fish introduced to the ponds are free from external parasites. Achieving this involves stocking the brood fish in separate tanks or ponds for quarantine, typically for about a week, to meticulously confirm the absence of external parasites. This quarantine process stands as the most effective measure to prevent the entry of external parasites into the ponds. A precautionary approach to water quality management is essential for preventing and controlling infestations in breeding ponds. Achieving optimal pond water quality involves the systematic use of probiotics to ensure the decomposition of fish faecal matter and other wastes accumulated at the pond’s bottom. Regular applications of probiotics enhance water quality, creating a favourable environment for phytoplankton bloom.
