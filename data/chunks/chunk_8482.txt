Simple sequence repeat profiling in maize revealed high level of polymorphism (432 SSR alleles), leading to effective discrimination of its various inbred lines. The average number of detected SSR alleles per locus was 7.45. Reconfirmation of allele designations aided in placing a high degree of confidence in dataset generated using SSRs. The study also revealed a large number of ‘rare’ SSR alleles (limited to 3 out of 69 inbreds), of which 89 alleles were found in Indian maize inbreds, and only 20 were found in the CIMMYT lines. l Molecular profiling carried out of 15 hybrids of maize, including 10 released single-cross maize hybrids. l Identified resistant genotypes of maize for maydis leaf blight, Turcicum leaf blight and sorghum downy mildew. In maize, an early composite Narmada Moti of white semi-flint type has been released and notified for kharif. It is promising for Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh Maize composites/hybrids released and notified Variety Yield Maturity Season Grain type Area of adaptation tonnes/ha Central Releases Composite Narmada Moti 4.0 Early Kharif White semi-flint Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh Priya sweet corn 2.22 Medium Kharif and rabi Yellow dent, sweet Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka State Releases DHM 2 5.4–5.6 Full season Kharif Yellow semi-flint Karnataka bold grain Gujarat Makka 3 5.49–7.25 Early Rabi White flint Gujarat NAC 6002 5.6 Early Kharif Semi-dent Karnataka Jawahar Makka 216 5.0–5.5 (kharif) Medium Kharif and rabi Flint to semi-dent Madhya Pradesh 5.5–6.3 (rabi) CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 23 Molecular profiling of 15 hybrids including 10 single-cross maize hybrids released was carried out. The SSR profiles showed distinct genetic nature of Almora hybrids (Vivek Hybrid 4 and Vivek Hybrid 5) from the rest.
