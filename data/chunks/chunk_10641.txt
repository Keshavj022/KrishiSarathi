 Marine cage culture with cobia (Rachicentron canadum), silver pompano (Trichinotus blochi) and seabass (Lates calcarifer) has emerged as one of the highly remunerative system. During 2014-21, marine cage culture has been expanded DARE-ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2014-2021 32 High Value compounds /Nutraceuticals all along the coast with more than 3500 cages as compared to only 476 cages during 2007-14. ICAR-CIFT designed green fishing vessel Sagar Harita DARE-ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2014-2021 33 G. Natural Resources Management & Climate Resilient Agriculture The land resource inventories of 314 blocks were developed during 2014-21 against only 19 during 2007-14 for effective agricultural land use plans. Land resource inventory also developed for 27 aspirational districts in 8 states. The soil health scheme was rolled out as a National Priority. A solution to the challenge of rapid analysis was provided by developing a portable and low-cost soil test kit/mini lab (Mridaparikshak) in 2015- 16 for rapid analysis, and distribution of soil health cards to farmers. During 2014-21, 11399 units were sold which facilitated soil testing service at farmers’ door step. Developed granular minerals fertilizers using low-grade rock-phosphate and feldspar, as an alternative to conventional P and K fertilizers. A matrix of slowly decomposing C compounds prepared by chemically treating mixture of indigenous leonardite and cellulosic waste. The application of these mineral fertilizers on various crops gave comparable yield at par with DAP and MoP but with half of their cost. As such these mineral fertilizers could be promising substitute of DAP and MoP. Developed soil biological health kit based on substrate induced respiration. The kit contains assemblies to incubate soil with a defined substrate along with an indicator “Gel probe” which changes its color based on the amount of CO2 evolved from soil. The color-change of the gel exhibits positive correlation with actual measure of CO2 and soil biological quality index. The kit is a simple, quick and cost effective to monitor soil biological health without much scientific skill and equipment. Developed a machine for coating of seeds with different microrganisms like rhizobium, azotobacter, azospirillum, phosphorous solubilizing bacteria one after other with a sticking agent through film-coating method. The formulation enhanced the yield of maize, ragi, red gram and groundnut by 17-34%, with a cost benefit factor 1.31-2.97 and prolonged Mridaparikshak: a mini soil testing Lab. DARE-ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2014-2021 34 the survival of the microbial inoculants on the seed (about 103cfu/seed) up to 90 days of storage. Designed and standardized mini pan evaporimeter of 30 cm diameter GI (20 gauge) with a height of 25 cm for on-farm irrigation scheduling in Eastern India.
