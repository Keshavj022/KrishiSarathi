 Way forward The way forward for promoting natural farming can be accomplished by supporting and promoting it through various schemes and initiatives. Financial incentives, training programs, and research grants can encourage more farmers to adopt natural farming practices. The government should collaborate with agricultural universities and research institutions to improve innovative practices and crop combinations that suit local conditions. Steps should be taken to facilitate market linkages for farmers practicing natural farming which create a demand for organic and eco- friendly products in the markets. Highlighting and sharing success stories can also inspire and motivate others to adopt similar practices. By implementing these strategies, Himachal Pradesh and other regions can further promote natural farming as a viable and sustainable alternative to conventional farming. Table 2.

The net returns per 100 plants were high in all combinations in natural farming systems. During the first few years of the kharif season, apple + French bean + vegetables get net return of `21,572 and apple + pulses + vegetables get net return of `2,04,352.30. In the same way, for every 100 plants for each crop combination in the rabi season, the net returns were `51,276.84, `40659.07, and `33,016.19, respectively. The net returns of natural farming were consequently higher than those of conventional farming for all crop combinations. Through a variety of extension services, the government must put initiatives to promote the use of this approach and develop eco-friendly habitats. In addition, farmers must voluntarily accept ZBNF practices within their farming enterprises. *Corresponding author's e-mail: achandelhp@gmail.com Apple-based vegetable intercropped combinations under natural farming Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana This Yojana brings • Per Drop More Crop. • Inputs from MoWR and DOLR received. • Increase in agricultural production and productivity and enhance farm income.
