For males, Block Agriculture Officer/ATMA had the highest closeness centrality score and for females, shopkeeper/ input dealer had the highest scores. Factors determining agriculture network usage among female vegetable growers were landholding, farming experience, group membership and caste while age, education, landholding and hours dedicated to farming affected it among male vegetable growers. Integrated Organic Farming System (IOFS) for livelihood, nutritional and economic security of small farm holders in Meghalaya: An IOFS model comprising of different enterprises, i.e. cereals, pulses, oilseeds, vegetable crops and climbing vegetables on protective structure all along the farm pond, fruits, dairy, fodder crops, central farm pond, duckery, farmyard manure (FYM) pit and vermicomposting unit was List of superior pollinators in cucurbitaceous crops and their role in enhancement of seed and fruit yield Crop Superior pollinators Seed yield increase over control Fruit yield increase over control Snake gourd Apis cerana indica and Bumble bee 32.70% 43.60% Round gourd Ceratina sp. and Bumble bee 54.69% 48.50% Bitter gourd A. c. indica and Ceratina sp. 106.70% 73.55% Ridge gourd A. c. indica and Bumble bee 39.74% 66.75% Pumpkin Bumble bee 94.38% 83.50% designed and tested on long term basis. The solid waste from dairy unit and farm was used for making FYM and compost. The model consists of a total area of 0.34 ha and a farm pond (0.046 ha) that can be put to use for aquaculture and duckery, and support crops with lifesaving irrigation. The model was demonstrated to 330 households in three villages, viz. Mynsain, Pynthor and Umden Umbathiang covering an area of about 300 ha. Results from beneficiaries who adopted the model showed that by merely investing an amount of ₹60,000 on IOFS, the farmers realized a net income of ₹65,000/ annum compared to rice mono-cropping or improved rice-vegetables cropping system. In this process, a total of 64.9 kg N, 19.8 kg P2O5 and 54.7 kg K2O could be recycled showing that model has a potential to augment 98.03, 83.89 and 99.45% of N, P2O5 and K2O hill based agro-ecosystems, respectively.
