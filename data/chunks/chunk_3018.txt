 For the management of collar rot in cowpea in Vellanikkara region and tomato wilt in Junagadh region, application of green manuring (Sunhemp) and antagonists either with neem cake or without neem cake is recommended as the best treatment combination. 4. Green‐mannuring (Sesbania aculeta) alone was found to be the most cost effective (C:B 1:6) in limiting the bean root rot and okra at Solan and Hessarghatta respectively apart from increasing yield. 5. Green manure + neem cake + Trichorderma viride lowered the wilt incidence and increased the yield in chilli at Hyderabad and seed treatment of pea gave excellent result against pea diseases at Kanpur. Epidemiology 6. It was found that the incidence of buckeye rot of tomato in Solan region was positively correlated with rainfall and humidity. The multiple regression analysis revealed the significant effect of temp., rainfall and humidity. 7. It has been observed that the downy mildew in bitter gourd at Vellinikkara was positively correlated with RH, rainfall and no. of rainy days. The linear function so obtained is recommended for disease prediction. Seed Pathology 1. Seed∙ treatment with T viride @5 g/kg was found effective to control seed borne fungi and increasing seed germination (91.3 %) in tomato as compared to control (54.3%) at Rahuri. www.icar.org.in 40 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Horticulture 2. The increased germination (90.8%) and suppression of mycoflora over control was recorded in carbendazim (0.25%) at Parbhani.

Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): Genetic Resources 1. In case of ber var. Gola has been found to be suitable for very dry areas, Kaithali for slightly higher rainfall areas and Umran for moderate arid and semi‐arid areas. 2. Pomegranate variety Phule Arakta and Bhagawa have been reported as the most promising for Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka (MPKV, Rahuri and ANGAU, Anantapur), Jalore Seedless and Jodhpur Red for Rajasthan (RAU). 3.
