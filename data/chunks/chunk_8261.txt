 The dry fodder yield was also maximum CROP MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 64 in staggered trenches (6.1 tonnes/ha), which was 96.8% higher over control. Microflora population and root biomass were more in contour-staggered trenches {bacteria (6.6 × 106 cfu/g), fungi (114.7 × 104cfu/g) and total root biomass (0.59 g/100g soil)}. Peak discharge from contour-staggered trenches was 30% lower than control; and it was about 27 and 13% lower in contour-staggered trenches and vegetative barriers, respectively. Peak discharge was delayed by 32, 24 and 18 minutes over control in the contour- staggered trenches, continuous-contour trenches and vegetative barriers, respectively. Lower runoff and delayed peak flow are attributed to higher canopy coverage of trees and growth of pasture under various treatments. Fruit crops Pre-harvest spray of GA3 (100ppm) + potassium sulphate (1%) significantly reduced litchi fruit cracking (14%) and increased fruit weight by 15% in cv. Shahi. The optimum fruit maturity standard of litchi cv. Shahi was recorded at 75-78 days after fruiting when pulp had 18 °Brix TSS and 0.5% acidity. A schedule of 100:50:100 g NPK/plant/year was optimum for litchi var. Shahi with fruit yield of 55 kg/tree at nine-year tree age, while a dose of 75:50:75 g NPK/plant/year was optimum for litchi var. China with 32.21 kg/tree fruit yield in seven-year old trees. A rapid technique (temporary immersion bioreactor) has been developed for mass production of quality planting material of banana cv. Namwa Khom and Udhayam. This bioreactor produces ~56 shoots/explant in cv. Namwa Khom and ~14 shoots/explant in cv. Udhayam within 21 days, which is four- and three-fold increase, respectively, compared to the standard protocol. Covering of banana bunches shortly after bunch emergence using non-woven, polypropylene bunch sleeves (both blue and white) advanced fruit maturity by 4.4 - 9.3 days, increased bunch weight by 1.6 - 2.8 kg over open (control) bunches with a benefit: cost ratio of 2 : 3.5 and improved the fruit quality compared to the control. Banana bunches were green, free from blemishes and insect damage, fetching 10-15% higher price. Foliar priming of Grand Nain banana plants at flowering stage with acetyl salicylic acid (0.1mM) combined with butylated hydroxy toluene (100 ppm) before imposition of soil moisture stress recorded bunch weight (18.78 kg), comparable to irrigated control (19.72 kg) and other chemicals such as glycine betaine (20mM), beta aminobutyric acid (100 ppm) and 2% urea individually. Multilocational evaluation of four potential grape varieties revealed a bunch load of 40 bunches/vine with an estimated yield of 11.76 t/acre and 30 bunches/ vine with an estimated yield of 15.11 t/acre at Pune (10’ × 6’ spacing) and Nasik (8’ × 5’ spacing), respectively, for var.
