 The SMMI and ESSMI identified the year 2003 as the driest year (SSMI: −0.99 and ESSMI: −0.89) and the same is verified by the SPI (−0.91) and SPEI (−1.17). Similarly, the SMMI and ESSMI identified the year 2020 as the wettest year (SSMI: 1.93 and ESSMI: 1.57) and the same is agreed by the SPI (1.16) and SPEI (1.04). When comparing the monthly satellite SM-based indices (SSMI and ESSMI) with the SPI and SPEI values, a similar trend is observed among the four indices except for some instances where monthly delay for SSMI and ESSMI is observed. Due to the extensive length of the monthly time series dataset (360 months), only two instances of this delay are illus- trated (Fig. 7b and 7c). A two-month delay between SPI/SPEI and ESSMI is evident in Fig. 7b and another instance of a one-month delay between SPI/SPEI and SSMI is depicted in Fig. 7c. This can be explained by the sequence in which drought impacts are felt: meteorological drought, identified first by SPI and SPEI is followed by agricultural drought as identified by SSMI and ESSMI values (Zhang et al., 2019; Bharadwaj et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2022). The observed delays may stem from the gradual infiltration of precipitation into the soil and subsequent deple- tion of SM reserves. Precipitation needs to replenish SM deficiency before it can adequately support agricultural activities, further contributing to the delay in drought propagation from meteorological to agricultural domains. The observed lag is not consistent across the study Fig. 6.

Palagiri and M. Pal International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation 134 (2024) 104175 6 period, appearing only in some instances on a monthly temporal scale. This is because, the time lag between precipitation and SM response can vary significantly depending on geographic location because of distinct soil properties and local environmental conditions along with various processes, including groundwater recharge, evapotranspiration, and vegetation response etc. (Zhang et al., 2022; Apurv et al., 2017). Nonetheless, the observed delays show the efficiency of ESACCI SM- based indices in capturing the drought propagation from meteorolog- ical to agricultural drought. Fig. 8 illustrates the spatial distribution of these delays, showing the progression of drought indices over several months. In the first instance (Fig. 8a), covering October 2017 to March 2018, SPI and SPEI indicate the onset of meteorological drought conditions in December 2017 (highlighted by the purple dashed box).
