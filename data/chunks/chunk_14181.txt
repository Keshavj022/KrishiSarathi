 This change is reflected in an increase in Iph values at Vadnagar, ranging 32–35%. In the Post-Medieval phase (1300−1850 CE) further aridifi­ cation is indicated by an increase in Chloridoid phytoliths and a decline in Panicoid phytoliths. Cyperaceae phytolith abundances remain below 10. Iph values around 44–46% suggest a further reduction of available moisture in the local environment. The phytolith data generally represent a stepwise increase in aridity over the last 2000 years, with the arid conditions of the last 600 years especially consistent with regional palaeoclimate records indicating arid events identified with the Little Ice Age (Dixit and Tandon, 2016; Kathayat et al., 2017), however our data may also indicate lower levels of local humidity prior to ca. 1000 CE than is indicated by regional palaeoclimate records. 5.2. Droughts and famines in historical records Drought in the Indian sub-continent is generally due to a failure (precipitation 2σ below long-term average) of the southwest monsoon. The drivers of failure are persistent atmospheric subsidence, with the EI Ni˜no phase of the Southern Oscillations (ENSO) having the strongest relationship with drought (Kumar et al., 2006; Ummenhofer et al., 2011). ENSO driven summer drought has been correlated with historic reductions in summer grain production, with flow-on reductions in Fig. 6. Phytolith spectrum from Vadnagar (absolute abundances). A.K. Pokharia et al. Quaternary Science Advances 13 (2024) 100155 8 winter crops requiring carryover soil moisture (Selvaraju, 2003). His­ torical accounts of famines in India record 14 famines between the 11th and 17th centuries, 12 between 1769 and 1858, and 20 between 1860 and 1908 (Das, 1988). While noting the complex social, political and environmental factors in famines, Kathayat et al. (2022) closely corre­ late multi-year monsoon failure in speleothem proxy data and the instrumental record with climate events such as the Little Ice Age and relate these to historical records of mass mortality famines, urban abandonments and social instability. Conversely - synthesising palae­ oclimate data, modelled past ENSO events and historical accounts, Damodaran et al. (2019) argue that while a number of crises during the 17th century in India were contemporary with arid conditions associ­ ated with the Little Ice Age, the authors question whether institutional or other historical factors played a larger role than environmental fac­ tors. The authors cite 19th century observations by Danvers and Campbell regarding late 18th century famines that describe disruption of labour patterns, institutional mismanagement and singular cata­ strophic environmental events as larger factors in regional famines than protracted environmental phases (Damodaran et al., 2019, p. 68).
