  It breeds naturally in captivity on getting optimal environmental conditions. Captive breeding in hatchery is undertaken in re-circulatory modular tanks (1000 l) and net cages. It breeds without hormonal manipulation.  Broodstocks of 100-150 g are developed in small net cages (2 m x1 m x1 m), fixed in ponds or open waters, at 100 numbers per cage.  Sexes are separate but morphologically it is difficult to differentiate. However, gravid brooders can be identified by pink to red genital papilla which is pointed in males and with enlarged ovipositor in females.  In Modular system of pearl spot seed production (MSPS), each tank is provided with a small rectangular plastic tray containing clay soil to facilitate monitoring of pair formation and breeding. The non-parent fish were separated following the first breeding.  Readiness for breeding can be observed through increased aggression and territorial defense. Eggs are laid on hard vertical surfaces. After 70-72 h of egg laying, the larvae hatched out; 600- 1900 nos/batch. The newly hatched larvae are separated from the parent fish by siphoning.  Larval rearing is conducted in plastic or FRP tanks (50-100 l). Feeding is done using live rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis@ 20-25 nos/ml or Artemia naulplii at 8-15 nos/ml. The larvae are weaned to artificial feed in the initial days of feeding.  Larvae attain 300 mg weight on co-feeding with live and inert feeds in 40 days. Survival rates of 80-90% can be attained with good feed, water quality and health management.  The technology is largely adopted in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

The fish is euryhaline in nature and in India it is found in coastal and mangrove regions.  Sexes are separate. Breeds during June-December with two protracted seasons. During breeding season, mature males (> 80 g body weight) and females (> 150 g body weight) can be identified with oozing milt and distended belly respectively.  Fully mature females having oocytes of >400 µm are induced to spawn with administration of hormones (HCG and LHRH-a) followed by stripping of eggs and mixing with milt for fertilization.  Fecundity ranges 1.15-1.50 lakh/kg body weight. Eggs are pelagic with single oil globule and having diameter of 750 μm.  Hatching takes place in 16-17 h. The newly hatched larval size range from 1.5 to 1.6 mm.  The larvae are reared in indoor/semi-outdoor larval rearing tanks with the introduction of green water and fed with rotifers (2–10 dph) and Artemia nauplii (11-20 dph) followed by weaning on microparticulate feeding regime.
