 The annual Groundnut Network Group-Asia (GNG-A) workshop and Scientists’ field day was held on 26-27 September 2019 to engage with private sector and to review the ongoing collaborative work, seek feedback to design Product Profiles, variety development strategy, testing, advancement, and delivery. Fifteen researchers and eight private seed/food/oil industry representatives from India participated in the workshop. The key objectives of sub-project on pigeonpea include (1) Development of FW and SMD resistant early (120-140 days) and mid-early (141-160 days) maturing varieties and parental lines of hybrids; (2) Development of super-early varieties of pigeonpea for non-traditional areas; (3) Development of efficient cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system and identification of fertility restorers; (4) Development of improved tolerance to phytophthora blight; (5) Development of high yielding mid-early hybrids of pigeonpea for central and southern zones; and (6) Sharing of knowledge, breeding materials and human resource development. During 2019, four super-early (ICPL 11255, ICPL 11301, ICPL 20340 and ICPL 11273), one mid-early variety (ICPL 15010), in addition to eight hybrids (ICPH 2431, ICPH 3310, ICPH 3481, ICPH 4788, ICPH 3782, ICPH 3933, ICPH 4200 and ICPH 4788) in short and medium-duration, and six pre-breeding lines, ICPL 15010, ICPIL 17116, ICPL 15072, ICPL 15062, IBTDRG 8 and IBTDRG 10 in mid-early and medium maturity duration groups were included in IVT, IHT and AHT1 of AICRP on pigeonpea. About 239 advance breeding lines, hybrid parental lines and hybrids in medium-duration, mid-early duration, early-duration bred for FW and SMD resistance along with and super-early lines were shared with AICRP partners. Total of 45 resistant lines identified at ICRISAT has been evaluated with National partners at 14 hotspot locations under AICRP disease nursery trials. In addition, 10 multiple disease resistant (phytophthora blight, wilt and SMD) lines identified at ICRISAT through repeated screening has been evaluated with national partners (6 hotspot locations) for identification of stable phytophthora blight resistant lines. High yielding multiple diseases (Fusarium wilt, and Sterility Mosaic Virus) resistant pre-breeding line ICPL 15028 derived from C. acutifolius is being used as a donor in the national crossing program of India. Evaluation of pre-breeding populations for phytophthora blight under sick-plot at PAU ICAR-CGIAR | ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 28 Red gain sorghum for brewing and animal feed – 1.5 times higher iron and 2.0 times higher zinc, 72% starch Ludhiana identified two lines ICPP 171328 and ICPP 171266 having resistance both at seedling and adult plant stage. These two lines belong to early- to mid-early maturity group with non-determinate growth habit.
