Spatio-temporal pattern of Seasonal Normalized Vegetation Supply Water Index (NVSWI) (growing season of wheat: December to March) from 2001-02 to 2019-20. L. Kaur et al. Agricultural Water Management 274 (2022) 107956 13 especially in arid and semi-arid regions. 3.5. Correlation analysis between NVSWI, VHI, SPI and GPP NVSWI, VHI, SPI, and GPP over the agricultural pixels in the ACZs were correlated with each other to determine the relationships and robustness of NVSWI to detect the drought (Fig. 9) during dry years (2002–03 in ACZ I; 2014–15 in ACZ II; 2016–17 in ACZ III). The results showed positive linear relationship between drought severity and vegetation health. The correlation coefficient between NVSWI and VHI (r = 0.92 for ACZ I [Fig. 9(a)] r = 0.753 for ACZ II [Fig. 9(d)] r = 0.935 for ACZ III [Fig. 9(g)] indicated positive linear relationship between drought severity and vegetation health. The very high positive correla­ tion between NVSWI and VHI reflects the ability of NVSWI to capture soil moisture conditions and vegetation conditions (Sandeep et al., 2021). The moderate positive correlation coefficients (r = 0.545) Table 2 Zone-wise agricultural area under Severe, Moderate and Slight drought categories based on the Normalized Vegetation Supply Water Index (NVSWI) values.
