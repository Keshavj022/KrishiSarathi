 Industrial level production of • This option is recommended for further Biogas/ Bio-CNG/ Compressed consideration • Cost of establishing one bio-CNG plant with a capacity of 5,600 kg of bio-CNG per day will be ` 30.20 crores. • Such a plant will consume 40 tonnes of paddy straw every day or 11,000 tonnes in ayear with 275 working days. • If 50% of the cost of plant and machinery are supported by the Government then the annual profit will be ` 209.23 lakhs per year. • If 1000 such plants are established then support at the rate of 50% will cause an expenditure of ` 15,100 crores to the Government. • 1000 bio-CNG plants will consume 11 million tonnes of paddy straw every year. 4. Power Generation from • This option is recommended for further Biomass consideration • The cost of establishing one 18 MW biomass based power generation unit will be ` 150 crores. Bio-gas (CBG) from Paddy Straw community level 39 Recommendations Sl. No. Ex-situ Management Option Remarks • This plant will produce 10 crore units of power every year and will have an average life of 15 years. • If 1,000 such plants are established then the electricity produced will be 10,000 crore units • If 40% subsidy on the cost of plant and machinery is given then the profit per plant per year will be ` 29.80 crores and the breakeven will occur in 5 years. • Total money required for subsidy at the rate of 40% will be ` 60,000 crores. • Total paddy straw consumed by 1000 such units will be will be 16.20 million tons per year. 5. Alcohol production from paddy • This option is not recommended for straw (lignocellulosic biomass) further consideration • Technical and commercial data on the plant performances is not available at this point of time. The experience of India is also limited. • Cost of plant and machinery for a plant with a capacity of 300 lakh litres of alcohol per year will be ` 800 to 1,000 crores. • Such a plant will consume 0.15 million tonnes of paddy straw every year. • Based on the cost estimates available in the literature (Japanese estimates) the loss incurred from such a plant will be ` 15,993 crores per year. 6. Ex-situ Composting of • This option is not recommended for Paddy Straw further consideration • The loss incurred by a farmer by composting off the field will be ` 1,500 per ha per year • 1% of land area will be lost for composting yard resulting in a loss of 43,500 ha in Punjab and Haryana and a grain production loss of 4.35 lakh tonnes every year. • The process of collecting and transporting the straw from the field to the compost site and managing it over the composting period are labour intensive and cumbersome. 40 Ex-situ Crop Residue Management Options Based on the facts and data collected from various sources and technical and economic analysis done of the various possible options of ex-situ management of crop residues following recommendations are made: 1.
