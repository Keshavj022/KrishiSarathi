 In cattle 78% of research resources should be earmarked for milk production research and 17% for draught power. Milk production research should claim most of the buffalo research resources (93%). Goat research should emphasize for meat research (57%) followed by milk (34%), while more than three-fourths of sheep research resources should be targeted to meat research. Poultry research resources should be allocated between meat and egg research in a ratio of 2 : 1. Equity Driven Trade Policy and Strategies for Indian Agriculture India has emerged as a major exporter of rice and its share in global rice trade has reached about 20% in some years because of liberalization of exports. The trade in wheat shows violent year-to-year fluctuations.

It is estimated that about 62 % of the rice area and 53% of the wheat area was not sustainable in 1990s. It may be mentioned that the un- sustainable sub-regions contribute about 55% to both rice and wheat production in IGP. Their share in increased rice and wheat production since introduction of green revolution technologies has been nearly 50%. The production increase has now been constrained due to plateauing of rice and wheat yields and limited scope of area expansion. In Trans-Gangetic and Upper-Gangetic plains, overexploitation of groundwater and declining biodiversity are responsible for unsustainability. Nonethe- less, there exists considerable scope to raise yield levels in the Middle and Lower Gangetic plains through technological in- terventions and management of natural resources. huge quantity, while in others, it had to go for massive imports. The study showed that export surpluses of wheat were of very transitory nature and their disposal as export necessitated huge imports subsequently, to stabilize domestic prices and to meet domestic requirement. In recent years, international prices of agricultural commodities have plummeted to a very low level hitting agricultural exports of India, which had been rising at a fast rate after initiation of economic reforms programme. International prices show very high volatility. Transmission of such shocks to farm level would destabilize cropping pattern and cause uncertainty in farm income. Since vast majorities of Indian farmers are either small or marginal, they do not have resources and capability to swiftly shift from one kind of crop pattern to another.
