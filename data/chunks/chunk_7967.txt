 Overall survivability at multiplier flocks was 93.3%. These farms have mostly focussed on increasing flock size; and sale restricted to 15-40%. The cost of production per goat/year varied from ` 3,260 to ` 7,800 and profit from ` 4,300 to 9,600 with an average of ` 5,280. Barbari Goat Unit at CIRG Makhdoom Mandya sheep flock Mecheri Sheep Unit, TANUVAS, Chennai: The nucleus flock strength of 606 Mecheri sheep including 350 breedable females was achieved. Breeding rams (59) were distributed to the field units to cover 3,568 breedable ewes. Sonadi Sheep Unit, RAJUVAS, Bikaner: A flock of 373 Sonadi sheep including 241 breedable females was built up for production of superior rams. Breeding rams (54) were distributed to the registered farmers to cover 2,662 breedable ewes. Malpura Sheep Unit, ICAR-CSWRI, Avikanagar: A flock of 873 Malpura sheep including 450 breedable females was built up. Breeding rams (51) were supplied/ sold to cover 2,628 breedable ewes. Goat Genetic Improvement Programme: Selective breeding of goats have shown significant improvement in body weights and milk yield. In Barbari goats, the overall least squares means of body weight of kids at birth, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of were 1.91±0.01, 7.71±0.08, 12.34±0.15, 16.47±0.22 and 21.94±0.34 kg, respectively, during the reported period. The estimates of heritability (h2) for body weight of kids at birth, 3, 6, 9, and 12 month of ages were 0.106±0.045, 0.230±0.073, 0.210±0.07, 0.267±0.077 and 0.171±0.066 indicating moderate level of additive genetic variance for growth traits in Barbari flock. The milk yields at 90 days and 140 days were 52.71±1.00 and 67.65±1.44 liters, respectively. Higher lactation performance of LIVESTOCK IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 52 sustainable livelihood security but also to address the issues of pig production system under changing climatic scenario by improved production and productivity. In addition, through its sub-scheme on AICRP on Pig centres located in different parts of the country, the institute has facilitated the release of six more location specific pig varieties namely HD-K75 (Assam Agricultural University), Jharsuk (Birsa Agricultural University), Mannuthy White (Kerala Agricultural University), Lumsniang (ICAR-Research Complex for NEH Region, Umiam, Meghalaya), TANUVAS KPM Gold (Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animals Science Univeristy) and SVVU-T17 (Sri Venkateswara Veterinary University). Poultry Jharsim: Jharsim, a multi-colour dual purpose bird suitable for rural poultry production was developed under AICRP on Poultry Breeding at BAU, Ranchi, Jharkhand. The body weight of birds at sexual maturity is 1.6- 1.8 kg. The annual egg production of Jharsim is 120-130 eggs under backyard condition, which is almost double than that of local native chicken (55 – 60 eggs/ annum).
