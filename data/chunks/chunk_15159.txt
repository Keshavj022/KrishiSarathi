 Some research has concentrated on predicting crop yield by examining specific soil properties such as soil type, depth, pH, and topsoil thickness [28,37], while others have solely analyzed soil NPK levels and pH [38]. In actuality, several interconnected and interdependent elements work in conjunction to dictate the crop’s output. In order to accurately predict crop growth under specific weather conditions, it is essential to gather a wide range of data from different fields and geographic regions. This is because the nutrient and abiotic needs of crops vary depending on the type of crop and its location. Additionally, it remains uncertain how the combination of soil NPK content, soil pH, and climatic factors would impact the precision, accuracy, recall, and F1 score when using a single crop category of either agricultural or horticultural crops or combination of both. To address this, the present study employed a vast public dataset that considers the soil pH, external application of NPK fertilizer, and environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity on a broad spectrum of crops. The data collected from a wide geographical region of India were sourced from Kaggle repository to evaluate the efficacy of ML algorithms in making efficient crop recommendations and to suggest the complementary correction measures to maximize the yield. This approach can be applied for various types of crops and regions having the similar environmental conditions. 2. Methodology 2.1. Data The dataset utilized in this research was sourced from the Kaggle repository [39], which was collected over a period of time by the Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture [40]. It comprises a total of 2100 data points, encompassing 11 agricultural crops and 10 horticulture crops grown under variables for NPK fertilizer, soil pH, and climatic factors such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity. The scientific names of both agricultural and horticultural crops are reported in the supplementary file (S1). The dataset shows the mean values of externally applied N, P, and K fertilizers for agricultural crops were 56, 52.11, and 31.64 kg/hector, respectively, and corresponding environmental conditions such as 24.89 ◦C± 4.02 ◦C temperature, 64.20 ± 24.10 % relative humidity (RH), 6.67 ± 0.85 pH, and 90.90 ± 61.64 mm rainfall. On the other hand, horticultural crops were found to have received an average of 47.52 kg/hector of N fertilizer, 53.29 kg/hector of P fertilizer, and 69.09 kg/hector of K fertilizer. For horticultural crops, the temperature recorded was 26.19 ◦C± 5.83 ◦C, RH was 81.82 ± 14.8 %, pH was 6.31 ± 0.57, and rainfall was 112.67 ± 43.47 mm. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the models, the crops were divided into three distinct categories: agricultural crops (AC), horticultural crops (HC), and a combination of agri-horticultural crops terming them hereafter as AC-model, HC-model and mixed crop model (Co) respectively.
