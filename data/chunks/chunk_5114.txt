 In sick animals, all the 60 cattle were dull in behaviour, showed profused salivation, anorexia and had lameness. Their eyes were dull and slightly sunken. Their visible mucous membrane was bright red and dry. Mouth examination revealed ulcered tongue, lesion in dental pad and congested oral mucosa (Fig. 2a&b). Examination of foot revealed lesions in interdigital of the heal and coronet. Temperature: The mean body temperature of apparently healthy cattle was 38.32 ± 0.03°C. and of sick animals in treatment Groups I and II was 39.34 ± 0.03°C and 39.39 ± 0.02°C respectively (Table 1). The body temperature of the animals (Group II) after the treatment reached normal level. Analysis of variance showed that there was a significant difference in mean body temperature between the pre- and-post treatment stages (P>0.01). However, there was no significant difference between apparently healthy and Group II animals. Haematology: In haemogram, the mean values of haemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV) and total erythrocyte count (TEC) in apparently healthy cattle were 11.18 ± 0.04 g/dl, 35.23 ± 0.20% and 6.01 ± 0.04 millions/ml respetively (Table 2).

The post -treatments mean values of Hb, PCV and TEC reached normal. Analysis of variance showed that there was a significant difference in haemogram in sick groups(P>0.01) in pre-and post treatment stages. However, there was no significant difference in treatment groups. In leucogram, the total leucocyte count was made and absolute count was derived for differential leucocyte count.
