 The slopy land where soil is shallow and yellowish black is chosen for planting pineapple, litchi, plum, pear, peach, jackfruit, lemon, lime, pummelo, sisar (timber tree), bamboo, tejpatta (Cinnamomum tamala), and vegetables like mustard and beans. In the border, bamboo and timber species are planted as they check soil and water erosion. Simultaneously between the plants on border, broomgrass and lemongrass are planted, whereas some farmers plant Lantana camara to avoid entrance of wild animals. In the second line of the border, plum and peach are intercropped with lemon, lime, pummelo (Citrus decumena) and tejpatta (Cinnamomum tamala). In the third line, pineapple is planted with local variety of litchi and jackfruit. After an interval of 3â€”4 years pineapple is uprooted and after making small pieces it is mixed with the soil to improve the organic matter content of the soil.
