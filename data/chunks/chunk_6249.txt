 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Effect of pigeon waste on anoestrus animals At IVRI, of the 22 animals that were given Table 1. Effect of pigeon waste and allopathic medicine on oestrus and conception rate at IVRI Group Animals treated Animals came in heat Animals conceived ITK (pigeon waste) 22 Allopathic medicine 8 11 3 6 2 pigeon waste, 11 came in heat and 6 conceived, whereas 3 of the 8 animals receiving allopathic medicine came in heat and 2 conceived (Table 1). At GBPUAT, 7 out of 20 animals (35%) in group 1 and 10 out of 20 animals (50%) in group 2 Table 2. Effect of pigeon waste and allopathic medicine on oestrus and conception rate at GBPUAT Group Animals Animals treated came in heat Animals conceived ITK (pigeon waste) 20 7 Receptol (standard 20 10 therapy) 5 7 showed signs of oestrus. Different animals showed oestrus behaviour from 4 to 10 days (av. 6.71 days) after the start of treatment with pigeon waste. All the animals in oestrus were inseminated and 5 animals in group 1, and 7 in group 2 conceived (Table 2). Mineral analysis of pigeon waste: The results at IVRI indicated presence of high concentrations of essential micro-minerals in the pigeon waste, Table 3. Values of different minerals in pigeon waste at IVRI Parameter Value (ug/g) Calcium 839.20 Magnesium 516.07 Iron 1426.60 Copper 44.90 Cobalt 11.03 Zinc 140.85 Manganese 31.83 Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Fig. 1. Unprocessed pigeon waste at GBPUAT Fig. 2. Processed pigeon waste at GBPUAT which could be responsible for compensating the deficiency of these nutrients in heifers, leading to estrus symptoms. At GBPUAT, the pigeon waste revealed high concentration of iron, copper and zinc (Tables 3 and 4). The mineral composition of pigeon waste in 100 g was almost same (Table 5) as observed in the commonly used 30 g mineral supplements (recommended normal dose of mineral mixture). Table 4.
