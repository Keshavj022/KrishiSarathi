 However the residual effects of treatment did not show significant improvements in succeeding okra yield. Hence it is recommended for Bhubaneswar conditions. • Under brinjal‐ okra cropping sequence at Faizabad, the maximum mean yield of brinjal i.e., 269.55 q/ha and C:B ratio 1: 1.57 was recorded with the application of neem cake @ 5 q/ha + recommended dose of NPK through chemical fertilizers. The residual effect of same treatment gave the highest C:B ratio 1: 2.16 in Okra. Hence, this is recommended for Faizabad conditions. Integrated Nutrient Management Garden pea: • At IIHR, Bangalore, the garden pea variety Arka Kartik recorded the highest yield 105.2 q/ha with the maximum C:B ratio of 1:2.78 with the application of 10 t/ha FYM plus half dose of N:P:K (20:30:25 kg / ha). Hence, it is recommended for Bangalore conditions. • At Faizabad application of neem cake @2.5 q/ha plus half of the recommended dose ofNPK (15:30:20 kg / ha) recorded the highest mean yield of pod of in garden pea cv. Azad Pea‐3 (102.10 q/ha) with the maximum C:B ratio of 1:2.98. Hence, it is recommended for Faizabad conditions. www.icar.org.in 34 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Horticulture Tomato: • At IIVR, application of recommended doses of NPK (120:60:60)+ FYM @ 10 t/ha + Sulphur at the rate of 25 kg / ha + Azotobacter + mixture of all micronutritients (Zn, B, Mo, Fe, Cu and Mn) resulted in the best mean yield 413.83 q/ha along with highest C:B ratio 1:3.65 of tomato cultivar H‐86. Hence it is recommended for Varanasi conditions. • At IIHR Bangalore, cucumber hybrid Tripti recorded the highest yield of 269.2 q/ha with the C:B ratio 1:2.17 by application ofFYM @ 10 t/ha + halfNPK (30:25:40 kg/ha) + Biofertilizers. Hence it is recommended for Bangalore conditions. Cucumber: • At Varanasi the maximum mean yield of cucumber 218.76 q/ha along with highest C:B ratio 1:2.13 has recorded with the application ofhalfNPK (60:30:30 kglha) + FYM @ 10 t/ha + Biofertilizer. Hence, it is recommended for Vamanasi region. Carrot: • At Hyderabad the maximum yield (316 q/ha) with C:B ratio 1:3.70 of carrot cv. improved Kuroda was obtained with the application of vermicompost @2 t/ha +biofertilizers + half recommended dose ofNPK (25 : 20 : 25 kg /ha). Hence, it is recommended for Hyderabad conditions. • At Durgapura, the maximum yield of carrot i.e., 557.09 q/ha and C:B ratio 1:2.59 was obtained under half recommdned dose of NPK (30:20:60 kg/ha) + Vermicompost @ 2 tonnes /ha + biofertilizer. Hence, it is recommended for Jaipur conditions of Rajasthan. • At Varanasi, the maximum yield (246.80 q/ha )of carrot cv. Early Nantes was obtained with the application of half dose of recommended NPK (60:30:30 kg/ha)+ vermin compost @ 2t /ha + biofertilizers. Hence, it is recommdned for Varanasi conditions. • At Faizabad, the maximum yield (212.91 q/ha) and C:B ratio 1:2.98 of carrot cv. Nantes was obtained with the application of half NPK (40:30:30 kg/ha) +Legume green manure @2.
