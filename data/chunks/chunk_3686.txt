 Application of 25-30 kg vermicompost in two splits (One half with preliminary monsoon showers and second half into the later half of monsoon period) has shown improvements in canopy growth, fruit yield, fruit quality parameters (Juice content, total soluble solid and acidity content), soil carbon loading and better post- harvest shelf life of fruits. Results showed some exciting improvements in soil health in terms of microbial community build-up and microbial biomass nutrients besides crop growth and fruit yield, besides carbon sequestration as evident from lesser magnitude of carbon dioxide release from the inoculated plant rhizosphere than bulk soils. This consortium holds a very good promise in Khasi mandarin as a template to be tested in it. Table 3.

The plants suitable for intensive (conventional) farming get high amount of nutrients at its peak stage, whereas in organic farming, the manure applied needs to be decomposed first by microorganisms and follow mineralization process on which conversion to available forms like NO3 - and NH4 +, hence its availability was low when it was highly required. It is, hence, highly desirable to breed the fruit trees for organic cultivation such that it can change the treesâ€™ nutrient absorption pattern, increase nutrient absorption capacity, reduce root losses due to pathogens, ability to maintain a high mineralization activity in rhizosphere via root exudates, increased rooting depth, and associated ability to recover N leached from the topsoil. A considerable approach is urgently required to sustain the rising organically grown citrus requirement. Microbial consortium consisted of Micrococcus yunnanensis (Asymbiotic N-form), Bacillus pseudomycoides (K-solubilizer), Paenibacillus alvei (P-solubilizer), Acinetobacter radioresistens (P-solubilizer) and Aspergillus flavus (P-solubilizer) The integrated nutrient management approach takes into account the holistic view of various steps involved in developing an effective fertilization program. A comprehensive integrated nutrient management strategy developed for Nagpur mandarin (Table 5) needs to be replicated for commercial citrus cultivars, which comprises 35% RDF + 35% (RDF equivalent vermicompost + 50 ml microbial consortium).
