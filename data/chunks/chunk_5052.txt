Number of infested lady's finger fruits /m2 and extent of control (%) due to use of ITK and chemical pesticide Treatment Number of infested fruits /m2 Extent of control (%) T1 : Control 19.8 - T2 : Use of animal urine mixed with tobacco soaked water 6.3 68.8 T3 : Spraying of Monocrotophos 2.9 85.5 CD (P=0.05) 3.9 - borers by use of monocrotophos and ITK practice was 85.5 and 68.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION Use of animal urine mixed with tobacco soaked water was found to be equally effective as that of use of monocrotophos in controlling fruit borer in lady's finger.  HORTICULTURAL CROPS Code :1417 Title of the ITK :Control of shoot and fruit borer by tobacco-soaked water with soap Description of the ITK : The shoot and fruit borers in brinjal are very common in Kowakol, Sokhodeora, Jorawardih and Mananiyatari villages of Nawada district of Bihar. Tobacco is soaked in water overnight and the extracted liquid is filtered and sprayed on the affected plants with soap or detergent powder. The ratio of water and tobacco in solution is 10:2. This is in practice for last 30 years by maximum number of farmers in the village. Due to shoot and fruit borer brinjal yield reduces up to about 75%. Its control in brinjal through the use of tobacco-soaked water is effective up to 80_85%. Name and address of the discloser : Shri Mahavir Singh, Kawakol, Nawada (Bihar) 805 106 Location of use of the ITK : Kawakol and Sokhodeora, Block Kawakol, Nawada (Bihar) 805 106 Geographical indicators : Tobacco, a stout viscid annual, 1to 3 m high, unknown in the wild state at present. It was first grown for commercial purposes in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Important tobacco cultivated areas in India lie in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Bihar and West Bengal. Experimenters : Dr S. Choubey, Senior Assistant Professor, Department of Agronomy and Dr R. P. Singh `Ratan', Head, Department of Extension Education, Birsa Agricultural University, Kanke, Ranchi (Jharkhand) 834 006. METHODOLOGY Location The field study was conducted in village Kawakol and Sokhodeora, block Kawakol, dist. Nawada (Bihar). PRA and field study Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools were used with randomly selected 20 respondents in Kawakol and Sokhodeora villages in Nawada district to elucidate information on the efficacy of the practice focusing the points such as extent of control, effect on quality, effect on human health and environment, availability of related inputs, cost effectiveness, and impact on the yield of brinjal. Experiment The experiment was conducted with brinjal crop in randomized block design with 20 replications using 3 treatments, viz. T1: control, T2: spray of tobacco-soaked water; and T3 recommended practice (spray of endosulphan). Each treatment covered an area of 1,000 m2. Observations on extent of control, number of infected plant/m2 and fruit/m2, yield and economics of cultivation were taken.
