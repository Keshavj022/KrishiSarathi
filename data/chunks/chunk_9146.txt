 The germplasm hasbeen used to breed 25 improved potatoes of. which AUFRI JYOTI, KUFRI LALIMA, KUFRI SINDHURI, KUFRI CHANDERMUKHI,KUFRI BAHAR, KUFRI BADSHAH, KUFRI LAUVKAR and KUFRI SWARNA are grown commercially. The Institute has also developed the seed plot technique, which makes use of low- aphid periods for growing disease-free seed stocks of potato in the plains of northern India. The technique has been widely adopted by. the farmers. The cost involved in transportation of the potato seed is often exhorbitant and its availability to remote growers untimely. True Potato Seed (TPS) has proved # ;. to be an alternative therefore.

Research and development in the crop began in the first quarter of the nineteenth century. The crop is short-durationed in India (70-90 days) unlike Europe, where the crop is grown under temperate long-day conditions (150-180 days). it is grown. in summer in the hills, in spring in the mid-hills, during winter in the north- western plains and through the year in the Nilgiris and the eastern low hills. Suitable varieties and agrotechniques have been evolved for all ecologies. In Gujarat, potato yields surpass those obtained in the Netherlands. The crop is raised in the riverbeds where the water table is very high, 30-60 cm in the root zone, and the crop is phatosynthesizing actively the whole day. The yield is 65 tonnes/ha; in the Netherlands, it is 40 tonnes/ha.

Research has countered the myth both biologically and nutritionally. The group of crops are the most efficient producers of carbohydrates per unit area per unit time with sweet potato being the most-efficient energy producer in the plant kingdom. Nutritionally, energy released from consumption of the cassava starch is comparable to that from cereals, and the B-cartone in orange-fleshed tubers of sweet potato is on a par with that of carrot.
