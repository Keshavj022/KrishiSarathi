53 and similar distribution was also observed in treatments T1, T2 and T3 (Table 2b). Both from indoor and outdoor experiments, it was observed that banana pseudostem juice treated water and Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Table 2. Characteristics of juice extracted from banana pseudostem lime treated water had little higher pH than that of control. It is clear from the results that the juice is responsible for the increase in water pH, similar to that of lime despite the fact that juice itself was slightly acidic. This might be due to high alkalinity of juice and juice treated water. According to Boyd (1979), the most ideal pH for fish culture is 7.5 to 8.5. Since the pH of juice and lime treated samples had high pH, it can be concluded that the lime and juice treated water are more suitable for fish culture than that of control (T0). The results of growth of fish also justify the above statements. Total alkalinity In the study, alkalinity showed a narrow range of variation (Tables 3a and 3b). In indoor experiment the total alkalinity values varied from 225.33 ± 1.15 to 256.0 ± 6.92 mg/litre in T0 (control water), and it varied from 269.33 ± 5.77 to 294.0 ± 0.0 mg/litre in T4 (lime treatment). In banana pseudostem-juice treatment, variation of total alkalinity values was more or less similar to that in lime treatment. In the outdoor experiment, the total alkalinity values in T0 (control) were lower than lime and banana pseudostem-juice treatments. Ohle (1933) concluded that waters having alkalinity more than 50 ppm are most productive and those with less than 10 ppm cannot support good fish growth. Thus the juice as well as lime increased the alkalinity of water, thereby making the water more suitable for fish growth.

Total alkalinity (mean ± S.D. in mg/litre) during indoor experiment Total hardness Total hardness of water is due to presence of calcium and magnesium ions along with ferrous and aluminium ions. Swingle (1967) suggested that water hardness of at least 15 mg/litre is required for satisfactory fish growth. In the present investigation hardness values ranged from 193.33 ± 4.61 to 244.66 ± 1.15 mg/litre as CaCo3 in all the treatments under indoor experiment (Table 4a). But in outdoor experiment it varied from 36.66 ± 4.16 to 128.0 ± 5.73 mg/litre in all the treatments, which were conducive ranges for primary production (Table 4b). In indoor experiment the overall total hardness values were higher, perhaps because of summer months during which the experiment was conducted. The high value of hardness is generally recorded during summer due to higher temperature, which accelerates the salt concentration of water through evaporation. Dissolved oxygen Dissolved oxygen is perhaps the best indicator of water quality, especially for fish culture.
