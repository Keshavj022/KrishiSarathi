 Second, the model used kernel matching technique to compare adopters and non-adopters (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2008; Crump et al., 2009). Finally, the average outcomes for adopters and non-adopters are estimated, and the differ­ ence between these average outcomes provides the estimate of the treatment effects. The ‘IPWRA’ estimators combine models for the outcome and treatment status and ‘IPWRA’ estimators emerge naturally from a robust approach to missing-data methods. The ‘IPWRA’ estima­ tors are also known as double-robust estimators (Wooldridge, 2007; Wooldridge, 2010). 5. Data and descriptive statistics As shown in Table 1, paddy, maize, and cotton are the main crops cultivated in both rainy season and non-rainy seasons. Though the farmers in the study area cultivated redgram and vegetables also, due to paucity of data on these crops the study focused on paddy, maize, and cotton crops for the analysis. Further, the analysis is restricted only to Kharif (rainy) season due to a thin sample data representation in Rabi (non-rainy) season. As can be seen from Table 1, the mean value of profit significantly differs among adopters and non-adopters of SWC measures during the Kharif season for all principal crops.

Explanatory variables The explanatory variables used to generate the propensity score (i.e., the probability of SWC adoption) include, (a) plot-level characteristics such as area of the plot, soil type, level of erosion, irrigation, crop in­ tensity (i.e., the ratio of gross cropped area to net cropped area), and crop diversity (Herfindahl index),6 connectivity factors including distance of the plot to the dwelling, road connectivity, and distance between the plot and the market; b) socioeconomic characteristics including experience of household head, sex of household head, formal years of education of the household head, household size and social status; and (c) village level character­ istics such as community level SWC measures implemented through IWMP programme, extent of barren land, pastures, and current fallow land in the village where the plot is located.
