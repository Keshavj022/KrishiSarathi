 This has made agriculture more diversified and market-driven, where markets offer higher prices to the farmers. The rising diversification is evident from the declining share of crop sub-sector in agricultural output, from 67% in 1950-51 to 58% in 2019-20 (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the share of livestock and fisheries sub-sector is rising over time. As the crop sub-sector remains a predominant constituent of agricultural output, there exists huge potential for diversification towards other sub-sectors. 2.3. Commercialization of Indian agriculture The onset of the green revolution during the 1960s initiated agricultural intensification using modern inputs i.e., high yielding varieties, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, etc. Subsequently, the level of input use has increased considerably and Indian farmers are steadily shifting from using home grown farm inputs to off-farm inputs. The evidences from both factor and product markets indicate that Indian agriculture is gradually transitioning towards commercialization, with the rising dependence on the market for input needs and output disposal (Table 3).

Indian Agriculture after Independence 386 The product side change is indicated through increasing marketed surplus and agricultural exports, and a diversification towards non-food grains crops. For instance, the farmers disposed of about 78% of the products they raised to the market in the Triennium ending (TE) 2017-18, which was 68% just a decade before. The share of exports has also risen from 3.3% in TE 1987-88 to 7.8% in TE 2017-18. Higher area allocations have supported these responses to the markets. To date, around two-thirds of the total crop sector output is contributed by non-food crops such as cotton for which domestic and trade values are substantial. On the factor side, rising commercialization is reflected from the increasing use of quality seeds and fertilizer consumption, improvement in irrigation coverage and electricity use, and reduction in labor use due to rising farm mechanization and other developmental factors. Pesticide use is also witnessing notable transition despite the presence of regulatory issues (Subash et al. 2017). 2.4.
