The KVKs have to provide multidisciplinary and broad- based technological interventions to enable farmers to manage their farm in a sustainable and integrated manner, which demands enhanced manpower not only in terms of number but also covering the most important subject matter areas relevant to the district. With ever-growing nature and quantum of workload of each KVK, the existing six SMSs are finding it difficult to cope up with their responsibilities. It is, therefore, recommended that four additional posts of SMSs (Scientists) should be created in each KVK, thus, increasing the number of SMSs to 10.
