 By using such products in an integrated approach will help to reduce the use of synthetic pesticides from entering into the environment and also reduce the cost of production.

As evident from recent studies, plant bioregulators (ABA and ethylene) could produce uniformly coloured berries in India and may be a viable alternative to overcome the problem of uneven ripening of coloured grape varieties. Furthermore, since ethylene (Ethrel) is more affordable than abscisic acid, the study advocate using it to enhance the colour of grape berries in commercial viticulture. G RAPE (Vitis vinifera L.) is a member of the Vitaceae family and originated in the temperate region between the Black and Caspian Seas. The European grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) and American grapes (Vitis labrusca and V. rotundifolia) are the two-important species of cultivated grapevines worldwide, along with a few French hybrids. With the world scenario of grape consumption pattern, the grape has been preferred mostly for wine preparation, whereas a limited quantity of grapes is used for table purposes, raisins, and juice delicacies. However, an opposite trend of grapes consumption is prevalent in India, used primarily for table purposes, followed by raisin making. Despite the earlier introduction in India, the commercial cultivation of grapes started in the late 1960s with a meagre 800 ha area, which now occupy around 1,55,000 ha area with an annual production of 3.358 million MT and productivity of 22.39 MT ha-1 in 2020-21 (MoA&FW, 2022).
