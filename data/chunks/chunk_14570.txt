 Context and sampling This study was conducted in the rural areas of the Chandrapur dis­ trict of Maharashtra, India. Chandrapur is in the state of Maharashtra and was selected because of its differences in cropping patterns. To the west of Chandrapur, cash crops such as cotton are cultivated and paddy in the east. According to 2011 Census of India, more than half of the population in Chandrapur is engaged in agriculture as a source of principal employment. This district is also characterized by poor nutri­ tional status, particularly in rural areas. According to the National Family Health Survey 2014–2015, about 37.1 percent of women are below normal body mass index (BMI) levels, and about 50 percent of 1 In a nonagricultural context, literature among high-income countries shows that a rise in the opportunity cost of women’s time increases consumption of food away from home (Davis, 2014; Gawn et al., 1993; Prochaska & Schrimper, 1973; Cawley & Liu, 2012). For instance, Cawley and Liu 2012, show that maternal employment is associated with 17 fewer minutes cooking and 37 fewer minutes caring for children. They suggest that these findings suggest plausible mechanisms liking maternal employment and childhood obesity. V. Vemireddy and P.L.

Three blocks were identified during the formative research: Mul, Korpana, and Gondpipri, based on the differences in the cropping patterns. Mul is in the paddy-growing region, Korpana is in the cotton- growing region, and the Gondpipri block has households that engage both in paddy and cotton cultivation.

Pingali Food Policy 101 (2021) 102074 4 block-level and village-level government institutions, household and village lists were generated. 24 villages were randomly selected based on probability proportional to the population size sampling method (8 villages per block). Three hundred twenty households per block (40 households per village) were selected, based on formative research in 2014, bringing the total sample size to 960 households. The sample selection process is described in detail in Gupta et al., 2017. In each of the 960 households, a representative woman and man were interviewed, usually a husband and a wife. The most involved woman, who was responsible for the household and working in agri­ culture, was interviewed. If there were multiple women in the house­ hold, we selected the woman who is most engaged in agriculture and household activities. The questionnaires were piloted and were created after conducting focus group discussions and in-depth interviews across the district to understand the local cropping patterns and allied agri­ cultural activities in which households engage. During June 2016 –February 2017, detailed focused group discussions around time allo­ cation patterns in agriculture and dietary intake were conducted.
