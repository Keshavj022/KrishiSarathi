 Carpophilus truncates on Zea mays from USA, Rhizopertha dominica and Tribolium castaneum on wheat from Lebanon, Rhizopertha dominica, Sitophilus oryzae and Tribolium castaneum on Hordeum vulgare from Morocco, Acanthoscelides obtectus on Phaseolus vulgaris from South Africa, Bruchus atomarius on Lens culinaris from Lebanon, Rhizopertha dominica and Sitophilus oryzae on O. sativa and Zea mays from Philippines, Sitotroga cerealella on O. sativa from USA, Plodia interpunctella on Zea mays from Thailand and Callosobruchus chinensis on Vigna radiata and V. mungo from Bangladesh. Ten phytosanitory certificates were issued for export of germplasm. Germplasm registration: During the period under report 27 genetic stocks comprising cereals and pseudocereals (20), grain legumes (1), oilseeds (2) and fibre and forages (4) were registered. Promising wheat genetic resources for different diseases/attributes: Wheat genotypes, viz. WBM 3713 (FLW 16+Yr5/VL 876), WBM 3717(FLW 16+Yr5/ EC 582298), WBM 3721(VL 906/FLW 13+Yr15) and WBM 3733 (WBM 2112/ FLW 13+Yr15) developed through bulk-pedigree method of breeding, were found resistant DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 21 GENETIC RESOURCES DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 22 hence considered promising. Evaluation of rice germplasm for yield and other components related to yield stability: A set of 210 tropical japonica rice (TPJ) germplasm lines were assessed with gene based/linked markers for fertility restorer genes, Rf3 and Rf4 for identification of potential restorers and maintainers. The identified genotypes were further crossed with indica rice genotypes for improvement of parental lines in hybrid rice breeding. A set of 550 rice genotypes, including mega varieties, short grain aromatic rice, NPTs and lines collected from different parts of country were evaluated for yield and components such as number of tillers/plant, plant height, panicle length, days to 50% flowering, Plant germplasm registered by PGRC Crop National ID INGR No. Novel unique features Wheat IC 0620914 17001 Blue grain (aleurone) color.
