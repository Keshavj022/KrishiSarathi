 Aphids (Myzus persicae and Brevicoryne brassicae): Both the aphids are the serious pests of cole crops like Indian Horticulture 102 Corcyra production unit at ICAR-IIVR, Varanasi Pristomerus euzopherae, an endoparasitoid of brinjal stem borer, Euzophera perticella Brachymeria lasus, an endoparasitoid of Diaphania indica Table 3. List of some parasitoids along with their hosts recorded from the vegetable ecosystems at ICAR-IIVR, Varanasi Parasitoid Host insect Crop(s) Major activity Highest parasitization (%) Aenasius arizonensis Phenacoccus solenopsis Tomato, Chilli, Okra, Brinjal August – March 22.35 Diaeretiella rapae Myzus persicae, B. brassicae, L. erysimi Cabbage, Cauliflower January – April 21.60 Pediobius foveolatus Epilachna vigintioctopunctata Cowpea, Brinjal August – October 36.60 Campoletis chloridae Helicoverpa armigera Tomato, Pea January – March 17.63 Apanteles paludicole Sphenerches caffer Bottle gourd June – September 48.33 Trathala flavo orbitalis Leucinodes orbonalis Brinjal August – March 17.25 Cotesia plutellae Plutella xylostella Cabbage, Cauliflower February – April 22.35 25.75 Chelonus blackburni, Agathis sp. Earias vittella, E. insulana Okra August – October 19.58 Microplitis tuberculifer Spodoptera litura Cauliflower October – November 7.55 Cotesia glomerata Diaphania indica Cucumber September – October 28.34 Neochrysocharis formosa Liriomyza trifolii Tomato, Marigold December – March and January – March 37.50 48.30 Dinarmus basalis Callosobruchus chinensis, C. analis, C. maculatus Pea, French bean July – October 33.33 Apanteles obliqua, Meteorus sp. Spilosoma obliqua Cowpea, Field bean, Brinjal March – April 22.86 Brachymeria lasus Diaphania indica Bitter gourd, Cucumber August – October 19.20 Pristomerus euzopherae Euzophera perticella Brinjal May – July 12.48 cabbage and cauliflower even under protected cultivations. Both the nymphs and adults suck the sap from the leaves resulting in the plants turning yellow and losing its vitality. Beside sap sucking, they also secrete the honeydew which when deposited on the plants creates black sooty mould which inhibits the photosynthesis. Conservation of solitary endoparasitoid Diaeretiella rapae (Braconidae: Hymenoptera) is effective. The parasitoid preferred maximum for cruciferous aphids is Myzus persicae (59%) followed by Brevicoryne brassicae (51%) and Lipaphis erysimi (46%). However, among the cruciferous aphids, highest parasitoid emergence was observed from L. erysimi (88%) followed by B. brassicae (81%) and M. persicae (80%). Peak period of activity of this parasitoid is February-March under Varanasi condition. Ladybird beetle, Coccinella septempunctata, Menochilus sexmaculatus (Coccinellidae: Coleoptera) is an important polyphagous predator of aphid and other soft-bodied insects. Artificial release of 25-30 beetles per square meter is effective to control the aphids.
