Export: One set each of 353 samples of wheat advanced lines and varieties were sent to Bangladesh and Bolivia for screening against blast disease under collaborative research project. Total 1,688 samples have been exported to 8 countries (211 accessions each to Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Tanzania, Nigeria and Uganda) belonging to crops, viz. dolichos (50), mungbean (50), horsegram (50), cowpea (9), pigeonpea (2) and mothbean (50) under collaborative research project entitled ‘Evaluation of stress tolerant orphan legumes for dryland farming system across Sub- Saharan Africa and India’. Germplasm characterization/evaluation: Total 15,465 germplasm accessions were characterized for different agro-morphological traits at New Delhi. Agro- morphologically diverse core set is being developed in barley, lentil and linseed. Screening against biotic, abiotic stresses and herbicide resistance in different crops was done in 810, 1,025 and 2,014 accessions, respectively. Biochemical evaluation of 2,500 accessions of different crops was undertaken for oil content, fatty acid profile, protein, sugar, minerals, amino acids, antioxidants and active principles.
