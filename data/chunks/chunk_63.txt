 Farmers preferring alternate productive crops resulting into decrease in mothbean area over the years. • Damage caused by blue bull (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and other wild animals. Future perspectives • Mothbean is the most suitable and adapted to hot arid and semi-arid agro-climatic conditions, which makes it unique under the climate change and stressed conditions. • Given its inherent capability of withstanding stresses, mothbean has not been fully exploited for its genetic and genomic resources. Since there are limited number of genetic resources, efforts are 9040 5800 9400 19800 15029 20090 10700 10115 5259 9990 20401.33 14030 13810 13140 17526.65 29797.24 18487 30550 14400 16375 15031.88 13490 25696.67 16785 52.7 126.5 86.4 100.9 23.0 52.0 34.5 61.8 185.8 35.0 25.9 19.6 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 35000 RMO-2251 Barmer-I RMO-2251 Barmer-II RMO-2251 Bikaner- II RMO-2251 Bikaner-I RMO-2251 Churu-I RMO-2251 Churu-II RMO-2251 Jaisalmer-I RMO-2251 Jodhpur-I RMO-2251 Naguar-I RMO-257 Jodhpur-II RMO-257 Naguar-II RMO-435 Jaisalmer-II Monetary advantage (%) Net return (``/ha) Variety/KVK Net Return-FP ``/ha Net Return-CFLDs ``/ha Advantage CFLD over FP (%) Fig. 3. Monetary advantage of improved varieties of mothbean over farmers saved seed in Rajasthan Intra and Inter variations across district and varieties Substantial inter- and intra-variety as well as inter- and intra-district variations were observed in the performance of mothbean under farmer practice as well as CFLDs. A much wider intra-variety variation of 12 to 75% in productivity was recorded under farmer practice against the narrow variation of 20 to 32% under CFLDs. The intra-district and intra- variety variations in Barmer, Bikaner and Churu were 20%, 30% and 32% for mothbean variety RMO-2251, respectively. Interestingly, the inter-variety and intra- district variations were also in the same range at 32% for Nagaur, 34% for Jodhpur and 36% for Jaisalmer. This indicated that introduction of HYVs alone cannot help in managing in realizing the potential yields of mothbean in Rajasthan. The management of natural resources and other yield maximizing options shall have to be put in place in the production cycle for realizing the potential harvests from the HYVs. Mothbean variety RMO 2251 proved the best performing which should be promoted by the state department of agriculture. The gap between yields obtained at demonstrations and farmers practices ranged from 16.3 to 64.6%. The narrowest yield gap of 16.3% was recorded under Jaisalmer conditions with ‘RMO-435’ mothbean and widest gap of 64.6% under Barmer conditions with ‘RMO-2251’ variety of mothbean (Fig. 2).
