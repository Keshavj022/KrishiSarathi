 In order to enable members of the Technical Services to give their best to the organization, the (CAR introduced from 1 October 1975 new personnel po!ides for its Technical Services. The present handbook con- tains information on the rules and procedures relating to the recruitment, assessment and promotion of the staffbelonging to the Technical Services. It is hoped that the attractive service conditions introduced for Technical Serv- ices will stimulate everyone belonging 10 the.~e Services to discharge the work assigned to each in a dedicated manner. The human l>ody is the best teacher of successful organization. Every part of the body performs a specific function and yet at the same time the whole body functions in a coordinated manner. When any panicular part of !he body does not function well, then the body becomes sick to varying de- grees. It is hence that the ICAR considers it important that every section of its staff has conditions of service which can help them to concentrate on their work and practise the percept that "all rights accrue from a duty well done".
