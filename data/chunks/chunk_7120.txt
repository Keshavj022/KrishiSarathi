88%) was recorded on coriander plants treated with IPM module (seed treatment with imidacloprid 600FS @ 3 ml/kg seed + foliar spray of ker plant extract @ 10 ml/litre + Verticillium lecani (1×108 cfu/g) @ 6 g/litre + fipronil 5% SC @ 0.035%). Similarly, thiamethoxam 0.025% + Synergist 5% proved most effective (>90%) in reducing the aphids population in fenugreek, coriander and cumin crops and was superior to the commercial formulation of thiameth- oxam. Disease management Molecular marker for specific detection of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense subtropical race 4 (STR4): By in silico analysis, three specific set of primers were designed (A) Before and (B) after application of Arka Mealymelt Management of sucking pests in okra: In search of new alternatives to neonicotinoid insecticides against sucking insect pests of okra, Flupyridifurone 200 SL @ 2.5 ml/l was observed most promising with lowest whiteflies (4.38/3 leaves), leafhoppers (4.86/3 leaves) and gave maximum fruit yield (10.94 tonnes/ha) and maximum B:C ratio of 1:3.22 under Raipur condition. Pest management in okra through organic sources: To promote organic pest management in okra, seed treatment with Bacillus pumilus 1% A.S (10 ml/kg seed) and application of 20 tonnes of FYM enriched with B. pumilus (5 litre/ha) recorded the maximum decrease in M. incognita population (67.57%) accompanied by Development of Loop mediated isothermal amplification assay for rapid and sensitive detection of Foc STR4 Arka Cucurlure A novel kairomone blend for effective trapping of male melon flies, Zeugodacus cucurbitae was standardized. The technology is based on combinative plant volatiles from cucurbitaceous fruits and cue lure. The lure attracts a larger number of males (~50%), over the conventional cue lure trap. CROP MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 85 whitefly, A. rugioperculatus were highly infected by S. lanosoniveum (@ 1×108 spores/ml) under laboratory bioassay. Effect of mulching on yellow leaf disease in arecanut: Plastic mulching during monsoon (June– October) along with nutrient management based on soil test results reduced the disease index by 34.5–78.8% during 2017–2020 in gardens with low initial disease index (2.9–5.8%). However, the disease index was more (26.8%) with plastic mulching in the gardens with more initial disease index (19.8%). Thus, plastic mulching is useful in combating the yellow leaf disease when initial disease index is low. and among these, Foc STR41/Foc STR42 set specific marker allowed target amplification of 248 bp in the characterized highly virulent STR4 Foc isolates but did not show any product amplification in other races (Race 1 and TR4).Thus, the markers developed in this study are novel and potentially useful for early detection and monitoring of virulent strains of Foc STR4.
