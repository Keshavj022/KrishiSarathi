 Farmers in Maharashtra and Karnataka have adopted pomegranate, utilizing drip irrigation and improved varieties like Bhagwa, while regions in Rajasthan and Gujarat have transformed arid land with date palm cultivation supported by tissue culture techniques. Ber, bael and watermelon grown in Rajasthan and Maharashtra, thrives with minimal irrigation, and aonla in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh offers sustainable income with its hardy nature. Kinnow mandarin in Punjab and bael in Uttar Pradesh and drought-resistant crops like cowpea have similarly adapted well to these climates. Key strategies like efficient water management, drought-resistant crop varieties, and strong market linkages, supported by government schemes, have enhanced productivity and economic stability in these challenging landscapes. In Indiaâ€™s dryland regions, various horticultural crop varieties are cultivated for their adaptability to water-scarce conditions and resilience to arid climates. Among fruit crops, ber varieties like Kashmiri Red Apple and Goma Kriti; aonla varieties such as Chakaiya and NA-7, and pomegranate types like Ganesh and Bhagya are popular for their drought tolerance. Other resilient fruits include custard apple (Balanagar), guava (Allahabad Safeda, Lalit), and bael (Goma Yashi). Vegetables also play a key role, with tomato (Pusa Ruby), chilli (Pusa Jwala), cowpea (Pusa Komal), cluster bean (Goma Manjari), brinjal (Pusa Purple Long), and okra (Arka Anamika) varieties showing high water efficiency and productivity. In addition, muskmelon (Pusa Sharbati), watermelon (Sugar Baby), onion (Arka Niketan), and drumstick (PKM-1) are cultivated widely for their robust performance in dry climates. These crop choices not only improve food security but also support economic stability for farmers in arid regions through sustainable land use. Indian Farming 46 January 2025 and crops to improve land productivity and enhance ecosystem services. This not only provides shade and reduces soil erosion but also helps create a more diverse and resilient agricultural system capable of withstanding climate variability. Enhancing food security In regions where food security is a pressing concern, dryland horticulture plays a crucial role in providing a stable and nutritious food supply. By growing a variety of fruits and vegetables that can thrive with minimal water, communities in arid areas can reduce their reliance on imported food products. This diversification of crops helps ensure a more balanced diet, improves nutritional outcomes, and creates local food self- sufficiency. Moreover, horticultural crops offer longer storage life when they are processed allowing farmers to preserve their produce for sale or consumption during off-seasons. This contributes to food availability year-round, further enhancing food security in dryland regions.
