 Salient achievements • Ten jute and allied fibre crop varieties: 2 of tossa jute (JROMU 1 and JROB-2), 1 of white jute (JRCJ-11); 3 of kenaf-3 (JBMP-3, JBMP-4 and JRHC-3); 3 of roselle (JRR-17 and JRHS-1); 1 of sun hemp (SUN-03) have been developed, released and notified for general cultivation in jute growing states. • Developed and commercialized “CRIJAF SONA” retting accelerator for faster jute retting. Whole-genome sequence of C. olitorius variety, JRO-524 resolving an estimated genome size of 415 Mbp and of bacterial strains of the ‘CRIJAF SONA’ retting accelerator have been decoded. With application of retting accelerator CRIJAF SONA, retting duration reduction 9 Crop Science 9 was 6 to 7 days; Productivity improvement was 8-10% ; Net income increased: Rs.12,000 to 15,000/ha. In 2020 and 2021, it was reached to 2.58324 lakh farmers covering 1.10893 lakh of jute area in 6 states. Royalty of Rs. 63.39 lakhs earned during last 4 years (2017-18 to 20- 21) after commercialization of CRIJAF SONA. • Designed and developed in-situ jute retting tank-based self-reliant farming with slow- moving rainwater and solar-powered free-flowing retting system for increasing income and improving fibre quality. Additional income of Rs.30,000-40,000 per hectare was obtained through in-situ pond-based farming and through improvement of fibre quality. • Developed and commercialized small farm implements (CRIJAF nail weeder /Single wheel weeder, CRIJAF Multi-row Seed Drill) for farm mechanization in the jute-based cropping system. CRIJAF Nail Weeder / Single Wheel Weeder resulted in weed control by 80 - 85%; manpower savings of 50-55 mandays/ha, yield increase by 2-3 q/ha (10-12%) and monetary benefit of Rs.18000–19000/ha. Royalty of Rs. 55.49.1 lakhs earned during last 4 years after commercialization of these three small farm implements. 4.
