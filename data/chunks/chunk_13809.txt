 With origins tracing back over 7000 years, current cultivated varieties are believed to have been derived from the wild Medi- terranean olive, or oleaster [2]. Over centuries, human activities have facilitated the ex- pansion of olive cultivation beyond its native range, introducing the crop to regions such as Australia, California, Chile, China, South Africa, and New Zealand [3–8].

Agriculture 2025, 15, 435 2 of 15 oil and table olives represent vital agricultural products worldwide, with annual produc- tion exceeding 20 million tons, largely concentrated in Mediterranean countries, which account for over 95% of this output [9]. In Morocco, the olive tree occupies a central role in the agricultural economy, cover- ing an estimated growing area of over 1.2 million hectares [10]. The sector contributes signiﬁcantly to rural livelihoods, generating approximately 51 million working days an- nually and signiﬁcantly contributing to national exports, which positions Morocco among the leading olive-producing countries globally [11]. The olive industry also supports soci- oeconomic development by ensuring food security and generating foreign exchange through exports [12]. Despite these substantial contributions, olive production in Morocco is increasingly threatened by various biotic and abiotic stressors. Among the biotic factors, pests and diseases pose a substantial risk, reducing productivity and threatening the long- term sustainability of olive orchards [13]. Globally, olive trees are aﬀected by several diseases, including Verticillium wilt, caused by the soilborne pathogen Verticillium dahlia [14]; olive leaf spot, incited by Fusicla- dium oleagineum (syn. Venturia oleaginea) [15,16]; and anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp. [17]. Recently, root rot diseases caused by oomycetes, particularly species of Phy- tophthora and Pythium, have emerged as signiﬁcant threats to olive production [18]. These soilborne pathogens survive in organic debris and soil as oospores, hyphae, and sporan- gia, enabling them to persist for many years under unfavorable conditions [19]. When conditions, such as waterlogged and poorly drained soils, occur, these pathogens become highly destructive, leading to root necrosis, reduced root vigor, wilting, chlorosis, and tree decline [20].
