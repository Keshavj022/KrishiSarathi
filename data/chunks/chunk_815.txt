87% higher than Co 238 (10.39 t/ha) in terms of sugar production. CoPb 95, as an early maturing variety, has 14.96% sucrose, 85.56% purity, and 10.19% CCS at 8 months, and 17.11% sucrose, 89.58% purity, and 11.88% CCS after 10 months. The seed cane rate of 6000 buds/ acre with 90 cm row-to-row spacing was found to be better for CoPb 95 in agronomic testing. In comparison to 150 kg/ha of nitrogen (127.2 t/ha), a nitrogen dose of 187.5 kg/ha generated 129.7 t/ha of cane. CoPb 95 was disease-free in the field, whereas smut, Pokkah boeng, grassy shoot and yellow leaf infection were found in Co 238. CoPb 95 showed moderately resistant smut reaction when artificial inoculation by steeping method was used for smut screening, whereas Co 238 was susceptible and CoPb 92 was moderately sensitive. CoPb 95 showed moderate sensitive and resistant reactions in red rot screening utilizing artificial inoculation using the plug method and nodal/cotton swab method, respectively. CoPb 95 showed less susceptibility to early shoot borer (6.46), top borer (6.77), and stalk borer (7.72) during insect pest resistance testing, whereas Co 238 showed less susceptibility to early shoot borer (7.27) and stalk borer (8.13) and intermediate susceptibility to top borer (18.17). After the plant crop, the ratoon crop also covers a significant area as it doesn’t require any type of field preparations or new seed as under ratooning previously harvested plant crop is regrown. Sugarcane N fertilization trials of ratoon crops of CoPb 95, CoPb 16181, CoJ 64, CoPb 92 and Co 238 were carried out during 2020–21 at Regional Research Station, Kapurthala, Punjab. Under ratoon crop, the performance of CoPb 95 was reported with better yield and quality parameters as compared to other popular cultivars when a 25% higher dose than the Table 1.
