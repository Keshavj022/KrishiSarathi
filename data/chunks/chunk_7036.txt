73% reduction in yield was noticed at 6.0 EC saline water. K A bio-consortia for agri-horticultural crops CSR GROW-SURE is a unique bio-stimulant comprising highly efficient salt tolerant bacteria strains CSR-M-16 (Bacillus licheniformis), CSR-A-11 (Lysnibacillus fusiformis), CSR-A-16 (Lysnibacillus sphaericus). The formulation was assessed for growth and yield parameters in tomato var. NS 585 and banana grown in sodic soils of pH 9.14–9.30 and partially reclaimed sodic soils of pH 9.2, respectively, and found more efficient than CSR-BIO. Tomato cultivation with application of CSR GROW-SURE at Samesi, Lucknow (ECe), respectively, over their corresponding initial ECe values. The cut-soiler technology reduced soil salinity and increased the mustard and pearl millet yield by 13% in 2020–21 over initial year (2018–19). Enhancing input use efficiency in papaya: Raised bed cultivation along with fertigation of 75% N, P2O5, K2O + drip irrigation at 80% ER + micronutrient foliar spray of zinc sulphate (0.5%) + boric acid (0.1%) (alternate months from 2nd MAP) significantly enhanced the yield of papaya cv. Red Lady and TNAU Papaya CO 3. Climate Change and Resilient Agriculture Wetlands as source of carbon accumulation and sequestration: Wetlands can serve as an effective C-sink in mitigating global warming. Carbon sequestration potential of the floodplain wetlands were assessed in different categories of wetlands of Assam and West Bengal. The estimated C in wetlands of West Bengal revealed higher accumulation which varied from 1.67 times (Tetulia) to 2.3 times (Raja) of the C content of their corresponding upland sites. Similarly, C deposit up to 30 cm depth of soil was also higher (1.7 to 4.2 times) than the carbon deposited in the reference upland sites in Assam. production systems varied from 0.57–0.87 t C-eq/tonne.. The lowest value was found under ZTR. ZTR system saved 34.0 and 48.6% of net life cycle GHG-emission over AR, SLR system, respectively. On the other hand, soil organic carbon sequestration in rice production systems over initial value ranged from 0.41–1.9 tonnes/ha. The highest C-sequestration was recorded under ZTR and lowest in AR system. The order of C- sequestration in different systems was ZTR > SLR > AR. Emission at pre-farm (in put-production to farm) segment for AR, SLR, and ZTR was 0.26, 0.23, 0.24 t C-eq/tonne, respectively, and it was higher than the emission during the on-farm segment. For the production of one tonne of rice, after accounting for soil C-sequestered, carbon footprint (net LCA of GHG emissions) followed the sequence of SLR > AR > ZTR. For production of one tonne of rice, the GHG emissions were 0.73, 0.76, and 0.87 t C-eq/tonne in ZTR, AR, and SLR, respectively. The total life cycle GHGs for production of one tonne of rice were 0.94, 1.18 and 1.04 t C-eq/tonne in AR, SLR, and ZTR, respectively. Of the three segments of rice production systems, viz.
