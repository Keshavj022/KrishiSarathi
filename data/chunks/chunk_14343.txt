 It is also important to note that the above estimates may be overestimated due to the attribution of benefits from SWC measures exclusively to land degradation remedia­ tion. The estimated results show significant crop wise ATT for yields as 3.38, 3.48 and 1.35 quintals of paddy, maize and cotton, respectively. These ATT are 20 %, 28 %, and 27 % percent respectively of the mean value of crop-wise yield of non-adopters’ group. Further, estimated re­ sults suggests that the impact of adoption of SWC measures on rainfed crops is more due to its nature cultivation compared to irrigated crops like paddy. It may be noted that owing to the changing base, percentage improvement in profit/yield across different ‘Levels’ of SWC adoption reported in Table 4 are not strictly comparable. For instance, in case of maize crop, the results reported in Table 4 indicate that compared to non-adopters, the profits are 35 % higher for the adopters.

Low, moderate and high levels of adoption of SWC measures are defined as such interventions when farmer implements at least one measure, 2–3 measures, and more than 3 measures, respectively. In case of multiple SWC interventions, comparison is made between adoption of low vs. moderate, low vs. high, and moderate vs. high SWC measures. The results pertaining to multiple SWC in­ terventions are reported in Table A.2 and the overlap test results are reported in Figure A.1. P. Dayakar and K.S. Kavi Kumar Land Use Policy 137 (2024) 107011 9 increases to 69 % and 66 %, respectively when community level inter­ vention and neighbor’s adoption of SWC measures are also accounted for in the impact estimation.
