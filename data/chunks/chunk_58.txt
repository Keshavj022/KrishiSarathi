However, being largely rain dependent crop and grown in stressed conditions, the intermittent productivity shocks are not uncommon causing shortfalls in supply and forces for imports to meet the consumption demands. In order to meet the projected demand of 35.23 million tonnes of pulses by 2032-33, a growth of 2.2% per annum is required in pulses production. As the luxury of area expansion under pulses has almost dried up due to similar incentives, price signals and level of productivity in competing and companion crops, the productivity enhancement is the sole option for enhancing pulses production. This requires a paradigm shift in technology development and deployment besides commercialization along with capacity building of the stakeholders. Exploitation of available yield reserves to realise higher production and genetic enhancement for yield and quality would be a critical factor in raising the productivity. The supply projections of NITI Aayog projected availability of 33.95 million tonnes of pulses in 2032-33 which implies a deficit of about 1.28 million tonnes. Given the present trends of growth in pulses production, this seems to be achievable with utilization and exploration of all opportunities to enhance the pulses production. In the follow up, the innovative cluster approach of demonstration in moth bean was initiated in Rajasthan for achieving higher production of pulses in the state.

Source: NITI Aayog, 2018 Cluster frontline demonstrations (CFLDs) A special programme for demonstration of new varieties through Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVKs) to promote adoption of new varieties of pulses was initiated under National Food Security Mission (NFSM) through a collaborative project of ICAR-DAFW in 2016-17. CFLDs is an innovation over individual and isolated FLDs and technology application research for popularization of the latest notified/released varieties along with full package of practices on a cluster of farmers’ fields of a village or more villages.
