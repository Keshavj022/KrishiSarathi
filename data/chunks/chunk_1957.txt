 Access to real-time information enhances the ability to respond quickly to changing conditions and optimize farming strategies. Enhanced Sustainability: By minimizing the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and water through targeted application, precision agriculture reduces environmental impact and promotes sustainable farming practices. Precision management of inputs helps preserve soil health, minimize erosion and conserve natural resources. 4.2. Agricultural Robots Agricultural robots often referred to as agri-robots, can play a crucial role in reshaping traditional farming practices. These sophisticated machines are designed to automate various tasks in agriculture, ranging from planting and harvesting to monitoring and maintenance. The use of robots increases productivity, safety, efficiency, quality, and consistency of products. Robots can be much more accurate and precise than humans.

Smart machinery and implements, including planters, sprayers, and harvesters, are designed to operate autonomously or with minimal human intervention, increasing efficiency and reducing labor costs. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Drones: UAVs and drones equipped with cameras, sensors, and imaging technologies provide aerial surveillance and monitoring of crops, livestock, and fields. Drones can assess crop health, detect diseases, identify pest infestations, and monitor environmental conditions, enabling early intervention and decision-making. Robotic Harvesters and Pickers: Robotic harvesters are capable of selectively picking fruits, vegetables, and crops with precision, reducing damage and minimizing harvest time. Vision systems, robotic arms, and grippers enable robots to identify and harvest ripe produce while leaving unripe or damaged crops untouched. Weed Control Robots: Weed control robots use various methods such as mechanical weeding, thermal treatment, and precision herbicide application to manage weeds in fields. These robots can navigate rows of crops, identify weeds, and selectively apply treatments, reducing the need for herbicides and manual labor.
