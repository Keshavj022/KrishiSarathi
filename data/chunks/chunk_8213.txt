Germplasm registration: A total of 53 proposals comprising cereals and pesudocereals (23), millets (4), grain-legumes (2), fibres and forages (4), vegetables (10), oilseeds (4), commercial crops (2), medicinal and aromatic plants and spices (2) and agroforestry species (2) were approved for germplasm registration. Germplasm evaluation: Cereals: A total of 472 rice genotypes/lines were identified as moderately resistant to resistant against different biotic and abiotic stresses. Some of the the important donor accessions for different traits are in table p. 22. Useful donor accessions for various value-added traits in wheat were also identified (Table, p. 22). Oilseeds: Groundnut: Eight advanced breeding lines— ICGVs’ 07268, 02206, 00387, 97058, 03056, 07223, NRCGCS 363, RG 595; four interspecific derivatives, VGs 0411, 0502, 0507 and 1012; and one released variety GPBD 4 exhibited resistance (<10% incidence) to stem-rot disease at harvest. Fatty acid profile of accessions (n=113) was studied using GCMS. The oleic acid (O) content was in the range of 38.1%- 65.6% with an average of 49.2% and linoleic acid (L) was 15.1%-38.5% with an average of 28.8%. The O/ L ratio was between 0.99 and 4.4 with an average value of 1.88. The accessions with high O/L ratio were in Spanish bunch type—TKG 19A (3.3); in Virginia bunch type— GG 20 (4.4); and in Virginia runner type— UF 70 (4.1). Three RILs progenies (5-8, 15-1 and 15-3) from cross GG 20 × CS 19 were found highly resistant to stem-rot disease with less than 10% mortality.
