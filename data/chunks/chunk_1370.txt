 The farmer has followed all the principles of natural farming, including seed treatment with Beejamrit, applications of Jeevamrit and Ghanjeevamrit at 7–10 days intervals, creation of Wapsa channels, mulching (Achadan) with dry grass, and application of Keetnashi and Roganshi solutions at 5% concentration every 7–10 days. Different crops raised through natural farming practices achieved higher equivalent yields due to the additional yield of intercrops like French beans and fenugreek. Additionally, higher gross and net returns and a better B:C ratio were obtained compared to the conventional farming system. Smt Pinky Devi notes a significant improvement in the soil’s physico-chemical and biological properties under the natural farming system compared to the soil’s initial status in 2018. Benefits and achievements • Cultivation costs have been reduced. • Increased soil fertility with a rise in earthworm and microbial populations. • Managed incidence of pests and diseases. • Reduced investment costs and gained additional income through intercropping. • Improved soil porosity and water-holding capacity. • Increase in the number of beneficial insects, such as honeybees and coccinellids. • She has been honoured by the district administration and the departments of agriculture and horticulture during Kisan Mela, exhibitions, and other events. • Additionally, KVK Solan has recognized her efforts in promoting natural farming and millets during Mahila Kisan Divas and Millet Recipe Contests. Impact Smt Pinky Devi is a self-motivated woman who, after being fully trained in natural farming and sustainable agriculture by Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Solan, is inspiring other farm women and men in nearby areas to transition to chemical-free farming and minimize external agricultural inputs. Her goal is to eventually help form a women’s FPO. She regularly serves as a resource person in training sessions and meetings, educating other farm women on natural farming and promoting millet cultivation. CONCLUSION The natural farming system has increased Smt Pinky Devi’s net income from her agricultural land while improving soil health and boosting earthworm activity. She serves as an inspiration, motivating other farm women to adopt the natural farming system. *Corresponding author email: anuraguhf@yspuniversity.ac.in Table 1.
