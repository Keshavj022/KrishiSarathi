 The peak fruit-setting period was observed during September–October and highest fruit yield was recorded in ‘Surti’ and ‘Katha’ (45.2 kg/tree) followed by Gola Gurgaon (40.7 kg/tree). At Aruppukottai, February pruning in ber was found best for enhancing yield. Maximum fruit yield in date palm was recorded at doka stage in Barhee (113.3 kg/tree) followed by Sayar (93.3 kg/tree), Khadrawy (90.5 kg/tree) and Medjool (82.3 kg/tree) at Bikaner. Maximum yield was recorded in Muskat 2 (20 kg/tree) followed by Shamran (18 kg/tree) and Umshock (14 kg/tree) at Jodhpur. The plants of fig Poona pruned to 6 buds and given a swabbing of 1.5% Dormex resulted in maximum sprouting number of fruits (750) and fruit yield/plant (23.0 kg). Pruning during mid-September found to be the best time at Bangalore. The nutritional requirement was standardized (900 g N, 250 g P, 275 g K/plant/year) at Rahuri. In phalsa, pruning height should be 20 cm from the ground level. Nutritional requirement for custard apple was standardized as 250 : 125 : 125 g NPK/plant/ year. The synthetic pyrethroids deltamethrin (0.2%) and fenvelarate (0.01%) provided most effective control for ber fruit-borer at Rahuri. At Anantpur, it was controlled effectively by spraying of Profenphos + Cypermethrin followed by Monocrotophos and Quinalphos. Application of Deltamethrin (0.03%) and Carbaryl 50 wp 0.02% as alternate sprays at 21 days interval gave an effective control to anar butterfly. Three foliar sprays of Cypermethrin (0.005%) and endosulphan (0.05%) with onset of monsoon at 15 days interval controlled stem capsule caterpillar in aonla at Jobner. At Aruppukottai, 2 sprays of carbendazim (0.1%) were found very effective against Isariopsis leaf spot in ber. Leaf and fruit spots of pomegranate in Ambia bahar was controlled by one prophylactic spray at flowering or fruit setting and subsequent 4 sprays at 20 days intervals by Ziram (0.25%) or Bordeaux mixture (1.0%) under Rahuri conditions. Four sprays of Chlorothalonil (0.2%) at 15 days interval was found most effective to control aonla rust under Jobner conditions. The fig rust can be controlled successfully by 4 sprays of Bavistin (0.1%) or Dithane Z-78/M-45 (0.3%) or Chlorothalonil (0.2%) or copper oxychloride (0.4%) at 12 days interval at Rahuri. The fruit rotting in date palm was minimized by 2 sprays of Carbendazim (0.1%) followed by copper oxychloride at Bikaner.
