 obtusa), coleoepteran (Callaosobruchus sp. and Apion sp.) and hymenopteran (Tanaostignoides Most productive and profitable cropping system for upland agro-ecosystem of Bihar under climate change scenario Indian Farming 18 January 2024 sp.) borer commence their activity with beginning of pod borer formation. To control these pests effectively, following measures are suggested: Foliar spraying • Spray of NSKE has been found effective against borer complex. To prepare it, 1.0 kg powdered NSKE should be tied loosely in a muslin cloth, soaked in 20 litres of water overnight. Muslin cloth may be pressed, and extract collected. About 200g of ordinary soap is added to this solution, thoroughly dissolved. • Spray of Acephate 45% + Cypermethrin 5% WDG (2 g/ litre of water)/Novaluron 5.25% + Indoxacarb 4.5% SC (1.6 ml/ litre of water) is effectively controlling Lepidopteran pests. • Spray of Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC (0.5 ml/litre of water) or Novaluron 5.25% + Indoxacarb 4.5% SC (1.6 ml/ litre of water) has been found effective to control Dipterans borers (pod borers). Dusting: Dusting with methyl parathion 2%, malathion 5% or carbaryl @ 25-30 kg/ha is effective. Economic threshold level (ETL): Most essential part of measures to control pests is timing of control. First spraying should be done when ETL reaches. ETL of different pests are as follows- Pod borer: 1.0 larva/ plant; Other Lepidopteran borers: 2-3 larvae/plant; Pod fly: 5% egg lying on pods. Integrated pest management (IPM): Recent emphasis is on identification of control measures that have a combination of different components, including simple cultural practices i.e., summer deep ploughing, adjusting planting date, shaking of plant, manual collection/ eradication of insect, chemical preparation, NMSE and use of biological pesticides, i.e., NPV, Bt. Products. Post-harvest care: Bruchids (Callosobruchus spp.) are serious pests of pulses during field and storage. An easy, simple, safe way to protect small quantities of grains is by smearing seed with 1% edible oil i.e. mustard/coconut oil/by mixing 2% fine inert dust like kaolin/lime powder with grain. For bulk storage, grains should be stored in airtight structures i.e., Kuthala/Bujhari and with Al phosphide @ 1 tablet/100 kg of seed. Spraying of 1% fenvalerate on ground surface and walls is also quite effective to check residual or ongoing infestation. SUMMARY Crop diversification serves as a pivotal strategy for alleviating economic stress within farming community. Persistent reliance on rice-wheat production system has led to various adverse impacts on human health, soil quality, and environmental well-being. However, introduction, adoption, and acceptance of new crop varieties and innovative production technologies hold potential to transform this situation. There is an imperative need to pinpoint cropping systems that can cater to diverse environments while bolstering farmers’ income.
