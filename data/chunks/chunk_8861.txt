 ● About 18 cultivars of coconut were analysed for fatty acid profile of oil ● A dryer for coconut with solar energy as main source of energy and electricity as an alternated source of energy was designed ● A new disease on cocoa named as vascular streak die-back was noticed. ● Eighteen new accessions of cashew were collected from different states DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 64 sp.) were also added to the germplasm. The cardamom accessions conserved in the in vitro gene bank maintained their genetic stability even after 6 years of conservation. Evaluation of black pepper hybrids for their yield at Valparai (Tamil Nadu), a high altitude region, indicated that HP 34, HP 105 and HP 813 were promising. Coll. 1041, was tolerant to Phytophthora foot-rot and yielded 4.77 kg (green)/ vine. Among 150 black pepper germplasm accessions screened for drought, HP 976 and Acc. H 892 were tolerant. Evaluation of promising turmeric lines indicated that highest yield of 34.7 tonnes/ha (fresh) with a dry recovery of 20% was recorded in Selection 585. Grafting of black pepper of Piper colubrinum, a rootstock resistant to Phytophthora capsici, indicated that tongue method (56.8%) and double rootstock method (78.2%) of grafting were significantly superior to other techniques. Among wild and related species of Myristica evaluated as rootstocks for grafting nutmeg, M. malabarica was most compatible. The cardamom Acc.PS-44 an open-pollinated seedling of PV 1, a Malabar variety, was found promising at Pampadumpara (KAU). Two superior clones, Acc. 8-4- D11 and 7-24-D11, were identified by the Mudigere centre. Coriander, RCr 441, RCr 435, Rcr 436, UD 446 and UD 684 were resistance to root-knot nematodes at Jobner. Sowing of cumin on 10 November was best to minimize wilt incidence, with higher green yield (3.63 q/ha). Guj. Cumin 3, Acc 1136, Acc 1145, Acc 1165 were moderately resistant to Fusarium wilt.The highest volatile oil content in cumin was found in EC 232684 (4.4%) and JC 147 (39%). SUCCESS STORY SOFTWOOD GRAFTING The technology for softwood grafting in cashew ● Germplasm collections of various spices were strengthened Grafting operation should be done under shade in a grafting shed/ polyhouse. On the selected rootstock seedling (about 2-month old; 25-30 cm height) 2 pairs of bottom leaves are retained and other leaves are removed using a sharp grafting knife. At a height of 15- 20 cm from collar region, the terminal shoot is decapitated by giving a transverse cut. A cleft of 6-7 cm deep is made in the middle of the decapitated stem by giving a longitudinal cut. A little portion of wood is removed from the inner sides of the cleft at the tip, so that after grafting, the graft joint will be perfect. A matching scion for the rootstock is selected. The cut end of the scion is mended into a wedge shape of 6-7 cm length by chopping off the bark and little portion of wood from 2 opposite sides taking care to retain some bark on the remaining 2 sides.
