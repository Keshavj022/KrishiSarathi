 Ludhiana (PAU), Mannuthy (KAU) and Urulikanchan (BAIF). At BAIF, 1,472 pregnancies were confirmed and the conception rate was 42.12%. At the KAU, average age at first calving in the daughters of second set of bulls was 1,013.57±12.12 days. The average 305 days milk yield of daughters of the first set of bulls was 1,949.83±8.00 kg and in the daughters of second set of bulls 2,042.19±26.83 kg. Three first generation Karan Fries (KF) crossbred cows at the NDRI, Karnal, gave record milk yield of 46.5 kg, 44.8 kg and 46.0 kg day surpassing previous best milk production of 44.2 kg for the Institute herd. Hariana cow yielded 3.98 kg wet average and 1.95 kg herd average DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 94 Indigenous Breeds Hariana, Ongole, Gir and Tharparkar breeds are being studied. Hariana: Overall conception rate in heifers and cows was 52 and 59%, respectively. Average number of inseminations/conception was 1.7 in cows. In 5 sets 47 bulls have so far been put to test matings. Daughters (1,060) have so far been born due to 4 sets of test bulls; 47% cows remained in milk and yielded 3.98 kg wet average and 1.95 kg herd average. Average age at first calving and first lactation milk yield was 56.10 month and 816.01 kg, respectively. Average dry period, service period and calving interval averaged 214.36, 160.16 and 443.45 days, respectively. Bull calves (10) put to training for draught took 36.70 ± 1.08 months to be ready for draught purposes. The mean fatigue score, an index of draughtability for empty cart was 2.00 to 2.50 after 2 hr work and 2.00 to 3.00 after 3 hr work. Ongole: Overall conception rate in heifers and cows was 55 and 60%, respectively. Average number of inseminations/conceptions was 1.7 in cows. Three sets of 8 each were put to test mating and 1,228 daughters (284+393+551) were born. More than 31,855 doses of semen of test bulls were available on closing date. Round the year 37% cows were in milk and yielded 3.1 kg wet and 0.78 kg herd average. Average age at first calving was 55.14 months. First lactation milk yield averaged 682 kg. Overall lactation yield in 300 days was 654 kg. Average lactation length and peak yield were 216.8 days and 3.26 kg, respectively. Dry period, service period and calving interval averaged 271.68, 198 and 486.34 days, respectively. Gir and Tharparkar: Livestock Research Station, Beechwal (Bikaner) and Cattle Breed Farms, Junagarh, were identified as germplasm units for Tharparkar and Gir breeds, respectively. The associated herds are yet to be identified. BUFFALO Network Project on Buffalo Improvement Breeding from fifth set of 15 Murrah bulls was completed and from this set 54,087 doses of frozen semen were stored (33,317 doses from 6 bulls at the CIRB, 11,784 doses from 4 bulls at the PAU and 8,986 doses from 5 bulls at the NDRI) for future use. Sixth set of 16 test bulls of Murrah breed (5 CIRB, Hisar, 5 NDRI, Karnal, 4 PAU, Ludhiana and 2 HAU, Hisar) was selected from among the participating herds.
