   After harvesting of summer crops deep ploughing is advised wherever sufficient moisture is there in the field particularly in those fields where wilt, stem rot and armature disease are frequently observed to facilitate soil solarisation.   Hot weather may enhance vegetables crop growth. Therefore farmers are advised to make arrangements for harvesting and marketing of their produce.   Need based irrigation and intercultural operation should be done in tomato, brinjal, chilli, okra and other vegetable crops. In banana, papaya and other crops increase the amount of water in the drip as per evapo-transpiration rate.   Complete the preparation of field for tuber crops like colocasia, ginger, turmeric and yam and transplant the tuber crops.   Vegetable nursery should be sown in 15 cm high raised beds. In case, nursery is protected by white agro net (mosquito net), viral diseases infection will not be there. Sowing should be done after seed treatment with fungicides against stem rotting diseases.   Mulching should be done in ginger and turmeric crops and water drainage should be well managed before rainy season.   Fall army worm is infesting maize crop in several parts of Chhattisgarh, farmers are advised to apply Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 250 ml/ha or Chlorantraniliprolea.i. 45 gm per litre + Emamectin benzoate a.i. 18 gm per litre @ 200 ml/acre. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 142 Zone–10 Andhra Pradesh Paddy   Paddy varieties NDLR-7, BPT-5204, NLR 3354, NLR-34449, JGL-384, NLR 4001, NLR 40054 and RNR-15048 should be transplanted during July.   Cultivate Non-lodging and submergence tolerant paddy varieties MTU 1161, MTU 1064, MTU 1140, MTU 1172, Swarna sub –1 for flood prone areas. In low lying and waterlogged areas, select MTU -1061, MTU-1064, RGL-2537 and MTU 1140, in salf affected soils MCM 100.   For Alluri Seetharama Rajju District MTU 1153(chandra) & MTU 1156( Tarangini ) are recommended .   Summer ploughing reduces weeds, pest and disease build up.   Direct seeding (ferti cum seed drill or wet direct seeding with drum seeder) at 20 kg/acre seed rate, SRI cultivation or MSRI at 2-10 kg seed rate reduces seed and labour requirement, saves water. Machine transplanting to improve productivity with minimum labour.   Grow green manure crops (Dhaincha, Sunnhemp, Pillipesara and Cowpea) as preceding crop to Paddy and apply soil test-based fertilizers.   Soil application of zinc sulphate @ 50 kg/ha as a basal   In case of non-availability or delayed supply of seed, farmers may use their own seed after ensuring germination percentage and increase the seed quantity accordingly.   Dry seed treatment with Carbendazim @ 3.0 g/kg or wet seed treatment with 1.0 g/l/kg seed to prevent seed borne diseases.   Soaking of seeds in nitric acid @ 6.3 ml/l of water for about 24 hours before sowing to break the seed dormancy in kharif paddy.   Apply 4.50+6.25+1.
