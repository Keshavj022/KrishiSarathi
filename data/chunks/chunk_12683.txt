In 2015, the state has declared itself a fully organic state. It is first state in the world which is wholly organic. Thus it holds great potential as well as challenges to sustain and flourish. The technical knowhow is limited in organic management of plant health and increasing productivity. The following are the major recommendations for doubling the farmersâ€™ income in Sikkim: i. The cropping intensity should be enhanced by utilising fallow lands after harvesting of maize and paddy and also by developing assured irrigation facilities. ii. The productivity of various cereal crops (maize, paddy, buckwheat,) oil seeds and pulses is far below the national average which needs to increase by making available seeds high yielding varieties and other necessary inputs timely. iii. Making available quality seeds and planting materials of horticultural crops and spices particularly large cardamom, ginger, red pepper chilly, orchids, turmeric and mandarin.
