 In Kerala, it has been cultivated mainly in backyards and plantations; in Karnataka only few places are spotted with abiu plants. Around 50 ripen fruits collected randomly from different locality (Gadag and Tumakuru district of Karnataka) were analyzed for the traits, viz., biochemical and mineral content at laboratory, ICAR-IIHR, Bengaluru. This exotic fruit is delicious and nutritious that has drawn much attention not only because of its attractive bright golden yellow colour but also for its nutritional value and health benefits. The fruit contains many nutrients and antioxidants that are beneficial for the human body, such as an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase activity, anti-microbial and anti-cancerous. The biochemical composition of Abiu fruits is given in Table 1. The pulp of abiu fruit has TSS ranging from 13.03 to 13.89°B, titratable acidity - 0.032 to 0.034%, total sugar - 0.77 to 0.80 g glucose/100g of pulp. Apart from this, it is also rich in phytochemicals such as total antioxidant - 1126.40 to 1132.80 µmol trolox/100g in FRAP assay and flavonoids -1.24 to 1.37 mg catechin equivalents/100g which indicated potential of its health promoting and functional food components Table 1. Biochemical composition of abiu fruit Parameter Range TSS (oBrix) 13.03 - 13.89 Titratable acidity (%) 0.032 - 0.034 Ascorbic acid (mg/100 g) 2.95 - 3.07 Reducing sugars (g glucose/100 g pulp) 0.25 - 0.27 Non-reducing sugars (g glucose/100 g pulp) 0.51 - 0.53 Total sugars (g glucose/100 g) 0.77 - 0.80 Phenols (mg GAE/ 100 g) 163.51 - 163.68 Total antioxidant (µmol trolox/100 g) (FRAP assay) 1126.40 - 1132.80 Flavonoids (mg catechin equivalents /100 g) 1.24 - 1.37 Abiu fruit offers several potential health benefits as it is rich in essential nutrients with predominance in potassium (1.25 to 1.28%), followed by nitrogen (0.90 to 1.01%), magnesium (0.17 to 0.18%), calcium (0.34 to 0.37%); and trace amount of phosphorous (0.10%). However, micronutrients such as iron (26.75 to 29.85 ppm) followed by zinc (2.12-2.18 ppm) and copper (1.37 to 1.46 ppm) were also found in abiu. The fibre content in the fruit helps in digestive disorder. It is rich in Vitamin A which is essential for eye health. The fruit is used to provide relief from fever and diarrhea and it is also used as folk medicine. The sticky latex that appears on the skin of the unripe abiu fruit is used to treat against intestinal worms in human body. Strategies for abiu diversification The area under abiu fruit is yet to expand as many of the fruit growers are unaware of its cultivation practices. Abiu can be a game changer in near future for its attractive yellow fruit with juicy translucent pulp and nutritional value. Fruits are available during winter months where many of the tropical fruits are not available in southern states and therefore huge scope for consumption is present and demand can be created accordingly.
