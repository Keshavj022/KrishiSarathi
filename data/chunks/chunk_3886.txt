 Harvesting, yields and economics Two years experiment on brimato revealed that about 7-10 fruits of brinjal and 40-50 fruits of tomato can be harvested from single brimato plant. An average yield of 2.56 kg of brinjal and 2.68 kg of tomato fruits have been harvested from each brimato plant. As far as marketable fruit yield is concerned, 35.7 tonnes of brinjal hybrid and 37.3 tonnes of tomato could be obtained from one hectare area. Cultivation of brimato is very economical as a net profit of ` 6.44 lakhs can be achieved per hectare with a B:C ratio of 1.91. Dual grafting of brinjal and tomato would be very useful for the urban and sub-urban areas, where limited spaces are available for accommodating vegetables in terraces or kitchen garden. Presently, research is underway in the direction of commercialization of grafted brimato at ICAR-IIVR, Varanasi so as to make more farmers beneficiary of this technology. Brimato holds massive promise for large-scale adoption for production of homegrown fresh vegetables in urban and peri-urban areas and is an important step towards self-sufficiency for catering rising vegetables demands in cities.
