5% and as foliar sprays @ 5 ml/L at 30, 45 and 60 days after planting gave significant yield. Another report, Goal (Oxyfluorfen 23.6%) at 0.75 L/ha applied 3 weeks after transplanting or Stomp Pendimethalin 50% at 2.0 L applied after transplanting and before irrigation gave the best control, resulting in highest bulb yield. Harvesting, drying, curing and yield Development of red pigment and the characteristic pungency of the variety are also important harvest indices of onion. Best time to harvest is when bulb attain full size and mature as per variety, the leaves gets yellow because in kharif season neck fall does not take place. The leaves are cut leaving about 2.0-2.5 cm tops above the bulb after complete drying. Curing is an additional process aiding the development of skin colour and also it is practiced to remove field heat before bulbs are stored. Bulbs are cured in field for 3-5 days in windrow method. In kharif season late harvesting results in doubles and bolting. Yield is about 25-30 tons/ha. The purpose of drying is to remove excess moisture from the outer skin and necks region of onion in order to reduce the infection of disease-causing organisms, while minimizing the shrinkage caused by removal of moisture from the interior. Curing is an additional process aiding the development of skin colour and also it is practiced to remove field heat before bulbs are stored. Wherever temperature is low, bulbs are cured artificially by-passing hot air at 460C for 16 h. Bulbs should be brought in shade and cured for 7-10 days to remove the field heat. The curing in shade improves bulb colour and reduces losses significantly during storage. Curing for 10-12 days in shade helps in development of more, number of skin and also their retention for longer period. Management of diseases and insects In Purple blotch caused by Alternaria porri, typical eye-shaped symptoms appear on leaves and flower stalks as small, sunken, whitish flecks with purple colored centre. Fungicides such as Mancozeb @ 0.25% or Chlorothalonil @ 0.2% or Iprodion @ 0.25% should be sprayed at Table 1. Estimation of kharif onion Benefit: cost ratio Cost of Input/ha (`) Yield q/ ha Approx. sale rate of onion per kg Price of marketable produce (`/ha) Net return (`/ha) Cost-Benefit Ratio 90,000/ 225 20/- 4,50,000/- 3,60,000/- 1:4 Mayâ€“June 2023 29 fortnightly interval. Stemphylium blight caused by Stemphylium vesicarium occurs on radial leaves of seedlings at 3-4 leaf stage. Infection appears as small yellow to pale orange spots or streaks in middle of leaves on inner side and flower stalks. Spraying of fungicide such as Mancozeb @ 0.25% or chlorothalonil @ 0.2 % along with insecticides deltamethrin (Decis) @ 0.10% and sticker at fortnightly interval. Thrips (Thrips tabaci) is very minute yellow to dark brown in colour and life of insect is 8-10 days. It is found in the axil of green leaves where it sucks juice of early emerging leaf.
