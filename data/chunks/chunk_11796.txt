Animals older than 4 months of age can be vaccinated. yy The freeze dried vaccine is stable and has a shelf-life of more than one year at 4Â°C. yy The vaccine will be useful for reduction of incidence of the disease in parts of the country where the disease is endemic. yy The vaccine technology is ready for commercialization.
