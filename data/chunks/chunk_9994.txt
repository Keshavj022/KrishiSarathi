 Impact on Household Income Table 31 gives an analogy between before and after intervention on household income. The income of the farm households more than doubled from the base year (2016-2017). As far as per cent sectorial contribution in the total income is concerned, the share of field crops and farm and non-farm enterprises sector increased over the base year, the share of horticultural crops and fisheries sectors reduced, and the share of livestock sector in the total income remained same in 2020-21 as compared to base year.
