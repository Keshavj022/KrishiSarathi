 Orange flesh sweet potato hybrid SPH 44 White flesh sweet potato hybrid SPH 65 Similarly, five purple fleshed, promising hybrid lines (SPH 31, SPH 30, SPH 29, SPH 15 and SPH 14: yield ranged from 22–24 t/ha) having very less (>5%) CROP IMPROVEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 55 weevil infestation were identified. SPH 29 had no weevil infestation whereas, SPH 30 had good shape and may be used for fried chips making. It also showed deep purple colour and could be used for anthocyanin extraction. Hybrid progenies such as, SPH 14, 15 and 31 had less amount of latex which are good for table purpose. Promising elite line of yam: A promising line of yam ‘SD-15’ with significantly higher yield (36 t/ha), good tuber shape and culinary quality than the check variety Sree Dhanya (23.5 t/ha) was identified. Greater yam: Sree Hima, has been identified for cultivation in Kerala with higher productivity (38 t/ha), medium sized, digitate, fused tubers with dark brown skin, purple rind and white flesh. It has medium starch (21%) and crude protein content (4.8%). FLOWERS AND OTHER ORNAMENTAL PLANTS Gerbera Arka Red: Flowers are double and bright red, yielding 360 flowers/m2/ year. Under Bengaluru conditions, it is suitable for growing outdoors throughout the year for display in beds or cut flower production. Spices Nutmeg: IISR-Keralashree, is a high yielding (75.6 q nut/ha and 15.12 q mace/ha), high quality nutmeg variety developed through farmer’s participatory breeding, suitable for growing in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Seed spices Ajmer Ajwain-73, is medium maturing (165–170 days) and high yielding (10.7 kg/ha) variety with seeds containing 9.15% total oil and 6.38% essential oil. Ajmer Nigella-1 (AN-1) has 9.09 q/ha potential seed yield. It is medium maturity (145–150 days) and the seeds contain 19.7% total oil. Total oil fraction contains 21.14% 9-Octadecenoic Acid (Oleic Acid), 3.32% Octadecenoic Acid (Oleic Acid), Cis-11, 14- Eicosadienoic Acid (3.14%). This variety is tolerant to root rot. Tubers of white yam ‘SD-15’ Greater yam var. Sree Hima Medicinal plants Isabgol: A stable tetraploid (2n=4x=16) (DTPO6- 6) line of isabgol was developed from the variety GI 2 using colchicine (0.1 to 0.5%) seed treatment. The tetraploidy was confirmed through flow cytometry, root anatomy, phenotypic observation and cytology. The tetraploid was fertile and stable over the years ( 2 0 1 0 – 2 0 1 7 ) . Morphologically the tetraploids were more vigorous than the diploids but late maturing. The anatomical comparison revealed that the size of xylem and phloem of stem and inflorescence stalk were larger in tetraploids than diploids. The seed yield was higher in tetraploids than the diploids. Bach (Acorus calamus): A new, high yielding variety, of bach (Acorus calamus) namely, Swarna Swara (APAc-5) was identified for cultivation in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Assam, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and North Eastern States. It has higher (69.
