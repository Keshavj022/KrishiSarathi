 1995 Release of PBW 343, high yielding wheat variety that replaced HD 2329 and occupied 7 Mha in 2004. 2005 India became the first country to overcome Ug99 attack of stem rust and now all HD and HI releases are resistant to Ug99. 2011 Release of HD 2967, high yielding wheat variety. In its third year of release, it covered > 8 million ha in 2014-15. 2013 Release of HD 3086, high yielding wheat variety. 2015 Improved HD 2932 and Improved HD 2733 are the first varieties develop through MAS against leaf, stem and stripe rusts. 2017 WB2 & HPBW01, first biofortified wheat varieties released. 3.3. Maize The maize production in the country has increased over 15 times from 2.00 Mt in 1950-51 to 30.24 Mt in 2020-21 with an average annual growth rate of 3.90%. The productivity increased by 5.6 times and area by 2.93 times during the same period. The major area expansion happened in the States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh. The peninsular region represents about 40% of area and 52% of production. The demand for maize will continue to increase in India due to its continued requirement in poultry and livestock feed. The growth trend of demand indicated likely requirement of 45 Mt by 2030. This requirement may be possible to achieve through scientific interventions like the development and expansion of single-cross hybrid technology, development of Indian Agriculture after Independence 86 climate-resilient maize genotypes, and application of novel breeding techniques in maize and mechanization of maize cultivation and popularization of conservation agriculture. Fig. 3. Area, production and productivity of maize in India The first AICRP for organized multilocation research started on maize in 1957. Prior to 1957, the maize productivity was very low at 0.55 t ha-1. The Government of India introduced several maize hybrids from the USA, and promising ones were recommended for cultivation after their evaluation. However, there was no significant impact on productivity due to the temperate nature of these hybrids, dent type, late maturity, and tropical conditions of India. The organized research on maize brought about several breakthroughs, such as the first set of double-cross hybrids, Ganga 1, Ganga 101, Ranjit and Deccan in 1961; the first OPV Jawahar in 1967; the of double cross hybrid (Hi-starch, Ganga 5, Ganga Safed 2) in 1969; high protein varieties, viz., Shakti, Rattan, and Protina with opaque 2 in 1971; first single cross hybrid Paras in 1995 and first marker-assisted derived hybrid Vivek QPM 9 with high lysine and tryptophan in 2008. The composite breeding started in 1967 and continued till 1988 (Rakshit and Chikkapa 2018). Six composite cultivars viz., Vijay, Kisan, Amber, Vikram, Sona, and Jawahar were released for cultivation in 1967 using the exotic and native germplasm populations through the systematic crossing. These became very popular at farmerâ€™s fields.
