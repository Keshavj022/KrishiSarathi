 These soils (acid saline soils) require special attention on drainage and salinity improvement through proper agronomic and Indian Farming 20 January 2024 soil conservation measures. Nearly 23.8% of TGA comprise slightly to moderately saline (1.09-3.27 dS/m), moderately acidic soils. On the other hand, about 44.0% of TGA of the study area comprises neutral, non- saline soils (parts of Majherpara- III and Majherpara-IV), which, appears to be best suited soils for crop diversification with maize, pulses and vegetables in rabi season and jute, cucurbits, colocasia in pre- kharif seasons. It was also observed that 77.8% of TGA has been found moderately suitable for sub tropical fruit plantations (guava, mango, sapota, etc.). Only, 19.4% of TGA has been marked as marginally suitable for most of the rabi and kharif crops due to severe salinity and drainage problems. These soils were recommended for multi-tier horticulture, integrated paddy- fishery cum backyard livestock and coconut plantation. Suggested alternate land use advisories Based on LRI database, land suitability evaluation and socio- economic interpretation through participatory rural appraisal (PRA) technique, agro-technology has been transferred to the stake-holders Table 1. LRI based suggested alternate land use advisories of the study area Soil series Suggested land use plan Majherpara-I (Fine silty, moderately acidic soils with occasional flooding hazards) (Fluventic Endoaquepts) Coconut plantation + Multi-tier horticulture (pre-kharif vegetables-F1 hybrids) + Homestead backyard poultry (Kaberi breed)/ duckery (Khaki Campbell breed)/ goatery (Black Bengal breed) + Integrated paddy-cum-backyard pond fishery (Indian Major Carp) Best Management Practices : Land shaping with ridge and furrow for drainage improvement / conservation tillage with 30% crop residue management/ Gypsum application/ Zn application @ 5 kg/ha + Recommended NPK dosages/ FYM @ 2-5 t/ha/ Vermicomposting @ 1-2 t/ha. Majherpara-II (Poorly drained, fine silty, strongly saline soils with occasional flooding hazards ) (Typic Halaquepts) Coconut plantation + Multi-tier horticulture (pre-kharif vegetables-F1 hybrids) + Homestead backyard poultry (Kaberi breed)/ duckery (Khaki Campbell breed)/ goatery (Black Bengal breed) + Integrated paddy-cum-backyard pond fishery (Indian Major Carp) Best Management Practices : Land shaping with ridge and furrow for drainage improvement / conservation tillage with 30% crop residue management/ Gypsum application/ Zn application @ 5 kg/ha + Recommended NPK dosages/ FYM @ 2-5 t/ha/ Vermicomposting @ 1-2 t/ha.
