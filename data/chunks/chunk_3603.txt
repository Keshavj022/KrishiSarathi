 Mulching: Straw mulching from November to March for moisture conservation and enriching soil organic matter. Weed mat mulch is also very effective for weed control and moisture conservation. Foliar application; N:P:K (19:19:19) (@2g/litre water) in the First week of January and August. Three sprays of micronutrients especially Zn (0.1%) and Boron (0.5%) at each three fruiting developing stages (i.e. in June, July and August).

Concrete mixture is put at the base of each pole to fix the poles firmly. Cost around 500-600/ pole. Number of poles/ha: 2,500 (at spacing 2 × 2 m). Planting: Rooted stem cuttings are plants @ 2-4 plants/pole at 30 cm distance from the pole base. Raised beds of 1 m width are prepared which may be covered with weed mat mulch. Integrated Nutrient Management Kamalam fruit roots are adventitious and shallow- rooted. Numerous fleshy branches show a luxurious growth trend throughout the year. Fruiting takes place in 4-5 flushes from May to September-October. Moreover, Kamalam fruit plants are heavy feeders. Under such conditions, if manures and fertilizers are applied in one or two shifts as a top-dressing basal dose, then the plant January–February 2024 19 Cost of Cultivation (Pole spacing of 2 × 2 m) Head Numbers or Unit Rate (₹)/Unit Amount (₹) Field preparation and pit digging 1 ha 50,000 50,000 Concrete pole 2,500 500 12,50,000 Plants 10,000 @ 4 plants/pole 50 5,00,000 Tyre 2500 100 2,50,000 Fertilizer and manures, irrigation, mulching etc./year 10,000 plants 30 3,00,000 Cultural operations weeding, intercropping, foliar sprays etc./year 10,000 plants 20 2,00,000 Total 25,50,000 flowering and fruiting come in 4-5 flushes from May to September. Pollination: Kamalam fruit flowers are night blooming and during daytime flowers remain closed. Flowers open for one time at night when pollination must be done.
