 May be made compulsory for all farmers so that a non-loanee farmer is not pushed to extremes in case of crop- loss. b. Ensure one hundred per cent subsidy on premium at least for a few years in case of small and marginal farmers. c. Promote PMFBY similar to general insurance with the help of commission agenta. d. Design crop insurance products with a village as a unit representing similar crops or cropping patterns. e. To increase competition, instead of selecting one agri-insurance player through bid system for a district, all the districts should be made open to all the players. f. A separate Agriculture Insurance Regulatory Authority needs to be established. g. A Toll Free Agri Insurance number should be launched. 8.3 Specific recommendations for doubling farmers’ income in Gujarat state: Agriculture sector   District and Taluka wise crop planning & cluster approach should be practiced to enhance yields.   The technologies available today in Gujarat can increase yield levels up to 75%, improve farm profitability up to 100%, besides reducing per unit production cost. Strategy: Follow- ups of krushi mahotsava by the line departments in a phased manner need to carried out to improve the adoption of technologies / GAPs.   Though Soil Health Cards (SHCs) can bring down cultivation costs by 10-25%, it is still found to be supply driven as farmers fail to realize nutrient management. Strategy: Demonstrate & train the usefulness of the recommendations of SHCs by applying recommended doses of fertilizer on experimental plots at every GP.   Focus on production of pulses by utilization of rice fallows and intercropping with coarse cereals, oilseeds and commercial crops (sugarcane, cotton).   Incentivizing the use of improved varieties such as: GAR 13, GAR-1,2,3, GNR-3 and 4 and Mahisagar in rice; Vaishali, GT-103 and GJP- 1 in tur; Meha, Gujarat 4, GM-5, GNM State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 168 – 6 in moong; Guj 2, Guj Gram 3, Guj Gram 3, Guj Gram 5 in gram; and GW 366, GW 11, GJW 463, GW 451, GAD- 3 (rainfed) in wheat.   Low SRR in wheat, desi cotton, pulses, groundnut and soybean. Quality seed production need to be scaled up on war footing which will improve productivity by 20-30%.   Tribal areas have relative advantage in organic farming due to: i) low level of input use, ii) shorter conversion period and iii) smaller yield reductions. These areas should be identified as organic zones and training support need to be provided   In situ moisture conservation practices (ISMCP) to reduce irrigation cost by 50% and improve yield levels and popularizing of ride and furrow makers improves the adoption of ISMCP by 75%, thereby their access have to be ensured by CHCs & localized subsidies.   Promoting INM modules with biofertilizers: E.g. Rhizobia for legumes and Azotobacter and Azospirillum for non-legumes and PSB / ZSB / KSB can reduce cost up to Rs. 5400 / ha.
