Secondary beneficiary farmers who are curious about and visit the FLD sites to gain knowledge learn from primary beneficiaries. Network beneficiary farmers benefit from having primary and secondary beneficiaries in their social network. All beneficiaries include primary, secondary, and network beneficiaries. Fig. 4.

Next we explore whether this information ﬂow results in adopting a new wheat variety. 5.3. KVKs’ impact on the adoption of HD-2967: Effects on network beneﬁciaries Table 7 presents the effect of frontline demonstrations on the adoption of wheat variety HD-2967 by network beneﬁciaries. Col- umns 1 and 2 present network beneﬁciaries’ impact estimates with and without a time-varying district control, respectively. In Col- umn 1, the coefﬁcient a1 shows a 19 % increase in adoption of HD-2967 between 2015–16 and 2017–18. Consistent with the covariates balance, the estimated coefﬁcient a2 is insigniﬁcant and reveals that the adoption pattern for network beneﬁciaries of frontline demonstrations is similar to that of non-beneﬁciaries (be- fore the demonstration interventions). The coefﬁcient of interest, a3; reveals that network beneﬁciaries’ adoption rate is about 10.4 % higher than that of non-beneﬁciaries. Again, when we include a time-varying district control in Column 2, the coefﬁcient a3 is marginally higher (10.5 % versus 10.4 %) than in Column 1, which suggests that the estimates are not upward-biased. Note that the magnitude of increased adoption is smaller than that of primary or secondary beneﬁciaries of frontline demonstrations.35 This result is consistent with Kondylis et al.
