 A clay ball is shaped manually by placing it at the center of the spinning wheel. Further the shaped vessel is preheated under sunlight during winter and in shade during summer. Preheating process provides optimum hardness and plasticity for further processing. Then hand building of the shaped vessel is performed. This provides the Fig. 8 Fracture toughness of C-H with varying volume fractions of horse dung.

Use of Clayey Salty Soils and its Composite Derivatives for Construction and Ceramics for Household Use 941 required shape and size for the cruse as shown in Fig. 10(b) (Kramer, 1997). The product dried in open for a week is then ﬁred using up draught kiln to around 550–7501C (Kaurwar et al., 2017a,b). Baking The manufacturing of pots is a seasonal process and is not carried out during rains and summers (Vincentelli, 2000). Baking has been performed using two ﬁring techniques open ﬁring and ﬁring in a kiln (Ravi et al., 2007). Out of these two techniques open ﬁring is oldest and still popular among potters of different parts of India (Ravi et al., 2007). The kiln preparation and loading requires 2–3 h while ﬁring time depends on the type of the method used. The ﬁring is usually done at night. The sintered products are allowed to cool in the furnace till next morning (Roux, 2015). Baking preference is a procedural choice rather than thought of design for the potter (Guo, 2017; Roux, 2015). These procedural choices correspond to the culture, climate, traditional knowledge inertia, and social narratives related to local deities (Guo, 2017; Roux, 2015). The technological changes are more resistant to adoption in domestic manufacturing than decorative styles (Habicht-Mauche et al., 2006). The open ﬁring process is usually performed on ﬂat surface where the raw products are arranged in circular pattern over a bed of dried chopped grass or materials from agriculture residue. Agriculture waste, animal dung, twigs and leaves are used as a fuel (Roux, 2015). Open ﬁring provides temperatures of 500–8501C (Vincentelli, 2000). This technique does not leave waste and hence less technological evidence of its practice (Vincentelli, 2000). The open ﬁring process does not need infrastructure but requires great technical expertise and observational skills to obtain required results (Perryman, 2008). Potters practice transfer of this technology within their household (Perryman, 2008). By 1970s, potters of this region shifted to kiln based baking (Roux, 2015). The use of open ﬁring has petered since then. Technological knowledge transfer related to soils and blends are performed by potter women (Kramer, 1997; Satankar et al., 2018).
