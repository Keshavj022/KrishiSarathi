 It was therefore concluded that apple-bagging was an effective measure to improve sanitation and safety. Extended Shelf Life Fruit bagging not only benefits growers and consumers but also extends the shelf life of the fruit. By creating a protective barrier, the bags reduce the risk of physical damage and microbial contamination during handling and transportation. As a result, the fruit can remain fresh for a more extended period, allowing growers to reach distant markets and consumers to enjoy fruits over a more extended timeframe. This increased shelf life reduces food waste and contributes to economic sustainability. Pre harvest bagging with double layered bag increased shelf life of mango cv. Alphonso. Sustainable Agriculture In the era of sustainable agriculture, minimizing the use of chemical pesticides and promoting responsible farming practices is paramount. Fruit bagging aligns with these sustainability goals. By reducing the need for pesticides, fruit bagging decreases the environmental impact of fruit cultivation. Additionally, the increased (A) Mango cv.

Challenges and limitations of fruit bagging The effectiveness of microclimate control depends on the quality and type of bags used. It can be challenging to maintain optimal conditions consistently, particularly in regions with fluctuating weather patterns. Bagging of fruits is a labour-intensive process, which can be especially challenging for large-scale orchards. It requires significant manpower and time, making it less economically viable for some growers. Bagging of fruits requires proper skill and training to ensure that the bags are correctly placed to adequately protect the fruit. Bagging practice is also dependent on the climate of an area. In areas with high humidity or excessive rainfall, bags can become a breeding ground for molds and fungi, defeating the purpose of protection. Response to bagging may vary according to fruits and varieties. Some fruits may benefit greatly from bagging, while others may not show a significant improvement in quality or appearance. Consumers may have aesthetic preferences regarding the appearance of bagged fruits, but some may perceive bagged fruits as less natural or appealing compared to unbagged ones. Future prospects As agriculture continues to face challenges related to climate change, resource scarcity, and consumer demands for safer and more sustainable practices, incorporation of bagging may boost the fruit crop production by improving quality and promoting sustainability. By protecting the fruit from adverse weather conditions, pests, and diseases, bagging can result in higher crop yields and subsequently increased profits for farmers.
