The annual income of farm household in Haryana is far higher than national average. The growth in real income should be at the rate of about 12.25 per cent per annum so that the goal of doubling the same can be achieved by 2022. The production technology seems to be the major key to improve the prospects of agriculture in the state. Research should be encouraged for evolving suitable production technologies to push up the prevailing technological frontiers. Investments in this direction may be envisaged, particularly for the rainfed regions with scarce water resources, and for regions where there is possibility of water harvesting. Agricultural development has to be integrated with the overall economic growth and generation of livelihood opportunities in the rural sector. Diversified and high value agriculture is the pre-requisite for high growth of nonfarm sector as it opens possibilities for value addition and strengthens backward and forward linkages with non-agricultural sectors, leading to livelihood opportunities for the indigent. The grain based cropping system is the main source of income (54.5%), followed by wages and salaries (24.2%) and animal (18.3%). Specific recommendations for doubling farmers’ income in Haryana state are:   The resource-scarce farming community such as small and marginal farmers, tenant farmers, share croppers, etc, deserve special attention. Devise micro-level action at district and block for crops & cluster approach should be practiced to enhance yields.   Land productivity enhancement with focus on efficient management of natural resources. The challenge of climate change is real and there is a crying need to develop a climate resilient agriculture. Development of climate resilient and input efficient improved hybrids/varieties.   Available technologies has potential to increase yield levels in case of wheat (19 -30%), gram (20-100%,), rapeseed and mustard (22-32%), paddy (40-45%), bajra (20-45%), and maize (50- 60%), Hence there is a scope of improving farm profitability and income.   Salt tolerant varieties and adoption of good agricultural practices can save the existing loss in the state of Rs. 655 crores.
