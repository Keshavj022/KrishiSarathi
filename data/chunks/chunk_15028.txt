 Interpreting the coefficient of interest 𝛼as the causal effect of access to improved rural road infrastructure relies on the assumption that within a state, the construction of program roads is not correlated with time-varying village characteristics that affect outcomes through channels other than the program road. Incidental Connections. The most basic estimating equation restricts the sample to the incidentally treated and control villages, which I hereafter refer to as incidental villages, and takes the form: 𝑦𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡= 𝛽𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡+ 𝜌𝑖+ 𝛾𝑠𝑡+ 𝜖𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡 (3) 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣is an indicator that equals 1 if program-ineligible village 𝑣receives a program road by 2006. To improve statistical power, I augment Eq. (3) to include all non-incidental villages which help in the estimation of state-year fixed effects. The estimating equa- tion takes the form: 𝑦𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡= 𝛼𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡+ 𝜙𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡+ 𝜌𝑖+ 𝛾𝑠𝑡+ 𝜖𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡(4) 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑣is an indicator that equals 1 if village 𝑣was classified as non-incidental. The coefficient of interest 𝛼is still estimated off the 18 I use the year a work order was issued or a program road was sanctioned for a particular village as a proxy for the year of program road construction. Journal of Development Economics 152 (2021) 102686 6 Y. Shamdasani sample of incidental villages as the 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡interaction term absorbs changes in outcomes for the non-incidental villages in the post period. Out of the 221 villages in my matched sample, 37 are program- eligible villages and 48 are incidental villages. 15 program-eligible villages and 14 incidental villages receive program roads by 2006. The number of program-eligible treated and control households is 289 and 346 respectively, and the number of incidentally treated and control households is 291 and 594 respectively. Given that road construction under the program commenced in 2001, there is variation in the length of exposure to program roads for treated villages — on average, I observe treated households four years after their village receives a program road. Table 1 presents baseline village-level characteristics by treatment status for all program-eligible villages (columns 1 and 2) and incidental villages (columns 4 and 5). For the program-eligible sample, consistent with the program rules, I observe that the mean total population is greater in treatment villages than control villages, though this differ- ence is not significant (𝑝-value of difference 0.304, column 3). The gross amount of cultivated land is higher in treatment villages relative to control villages (𝑝-value of difference 0.062). Treatment villages are relatively further away from key infrastructure such as bus stops, banks and wholesale markets, and agricultural wages appear to be higher; though these differences are not significant. For the incidental sample, none of the outcomes are significantly different across treatment and control villages (column 6).
