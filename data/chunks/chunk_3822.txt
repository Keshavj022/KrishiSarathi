org and provides online information about the herbal gardens and facilitates the exchange of medicinal species among the member herbal gardens within the country. In vitro and cryopreservation repository: In vitro repository is an important strategy for conserving flora with vegetative propagation, recalcitrant seed or in plants where seed formation is very poor. There are four methods of in vitro preservation, viz. cryopreservation (storage of tissue and cell culture at low temperatures, in some cases as low as -196°C), slow growth shoot culture, normal growth culture and regenerative excised root culture. In order to strengthen the efforts of in vitro conservation of MAPs, a tissue culture repository has been established at NBPGR, New Delhi. At present, ∼211 accessions MAPs (e.g. Coleus, Rauvolfia, Tylophora, Valeriana, etc.) are in vitro conserved and ∼975 accessions of various MAPs are cryo- preserved at NBPGR, New Delhi (Source: www.nbpgr. ernet.in). Sustainable utilization Sustainable utilization of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) involves the responsible and ethical use of these valuable resources to meet present and future needs. There are some key considerations for achieving sustainable utilization in MAPs: Conservation and biodiversity: Protecting and conserving the natural habitats and biodiversity where MAPs grow is crucial. This includes implementing measures such as establishing protected areas, promoting sustainable harvesting practices, and preventing the overexploitation of species. Cultivation and agroforestry: Promoting the cultivation of MAPs through sustainable farming practices, i.e. GACP (Good Agricultural Cultivation Practices) can help in reducing pressure on wild populations. Agroforestry techniques, such as intercropping with other crops, can enhance biodiversity and support ecosystem health. Harvesting and collection: Harvesting practices should be carefully managed to avoid damage to the plants and their surroundings. Implementing selective harvesting methods, such as selective pruning or tapping, can allow plants to regenerate and maintain their populations. Value chain and fair trade: Promoting fair trade practices ensures that local communities and indigenous peoples involved in the MAPs value chain receive fair compensation for their knowledge and resources. Fair trade certification and partnerships can help create market incentives for sustainable production. Research and development: Encouraging scientific research and development on MAPs can lead to the identification of sustainable cultivation techniques, efficient extraction methods, and innovative uses for these plants. This can contribute to the development of sustainable products and practices. Legal frameworks and regulation: Governments and regulatory bodies play a crucial role in enacting and enforcing laws and regulations that protect MAPs.
