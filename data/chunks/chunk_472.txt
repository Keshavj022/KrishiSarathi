 India cultivates a diverse range of millet varieties, including pearl millets, sorghum, finger millet, foxtail millet, kodo millet, barnyard millet, proso millet, little millet, and pseudo millets such as buckwheat and amaranths. Among these, pearl millet, sorghum, and finger millet hold the largest shares in Indiaâ€™s total millet production. The declaration of an International Year of Millets can serve several purposes and address various challenges related to global food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture. Here are a few reasons why such a designation may be considered important: Nutritional benefits: Millets are highly nutritious (Table 1), gluten-free grains that are rich in fibre, protein, vitamins, and minerals. They offer numerous health benefits, including managing diabetes, reducing the risk of heart diseases, and improving digestion. Raising knowledge of millets can stimulate their intake and help to better nutrition, especially in areas where malnutrition and diet-related disorders are common. Millets are excellent sources of dietary fibre, which aids in digestion, helps regulate blood sugar levels, and promotes a feeling of fullness, aiding in weight management. They contain a moderate to high amount of protein, making them a valuable source of plant-based protein for vegetarians and vegans. They are particularly rich in essential amino acids like lysine and tryptophan. Millets are predominantly composed of complex carbohydrates with a low glycemic index. This means they provide sustained energy without causing rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. Additionally, some millet varieties contain antioxidants like phenolic compounds and flavonoids, which have anti-inflammatory and disease-fighting properties. These antioxidants may help reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Millets are particularly abundant in minerals such as iron, which is essential for oxygen transport in the body, and magnesium, which plays a crucial role in muscle and nerve function. Food security: Millets are climate- resilient crops that can grow in harsh and marginal environments with minimal water requirements. They have the potential to improve food security, particularly in areas prone to drought, heat waves, and other climate-related issues. Promoting millet cultivation and consumption can diversify agricultural systems, minimize reliance on a few large staple crops, and provide farmers and consumers with as an other alternatives. Sustainable agriculture: Millets are considered environmentally friendly crops due to their low water and fertilizer requirements and their ability to thrive in poor soil Source: APEDA, Ministry of Commerce and Industry Table 1.
