Reduced streamflow in a catchment due to low rainfall refers to hydrological drought. The meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural drought altogether cause shortage of raw material and economic goods in the market, food insecurity and loss of livelihoods, culminating to the socio-economic drought (Du et al., 2013). Although it is difficult to predict the economic consequences of drought, it impacts an economy in a multifaceted manner. India is one of the world’s most vulnerable and drought-prone countries. Droughts affect up to 68% of India’s agricultural land, with 33% categorized as "chronically drought-prone," which includes desert and semiarid regions with annual rainfall of less than 750 mm (Kham­ bete, 2018). Since the last five decades, at least one drought has been documented every three years in India (Samra, 2004). India is one of the ten countries facing substantial socio-economic risk as a result of increased drought in the changing climate scenario (Liu and Chen, 2021). Geographical areas with recurring drought episodes are at high risk of future droughts, showing the increased spatial extent induced by climate change (Kundzewicz et al., 2008; Alamgir et al., 2020). The states of Punjab and Haryana in Northwestern India, receives nearly 73% rainfall from the south west monsoon (from July to September) every year. These states also receive rainfall during winters (December to February) from the western disturbances. Average annual rainfall in Punjab and Haryana ranges from more than 1000 mm in the north eastern parts to less than 300 mm in the south western parts. In this agriculturally productive northwestern part of India, drought affects one or more regions almost every year due to the unequal and irregular distribution of rainfall. Since meteorological droughts are area-specific as the rainfall deficits vary from area to area (Kingra and Misra, 2021), but this leads to agricultural and hydrological droughts (Abdul­ razzaq et al., 2019). Drought in agriculture, impacts plants and crops by decreasing vegetative productivity, which can lead to widespread crop failure.
