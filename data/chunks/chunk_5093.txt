 Investigations revealed the presence of active N- fixing bacteria in the phyllosphere of most cucurbits. It appears that during the association, N-fixing microorganisms have been incorporated in the leaf cells of cucurbits. Nitrogen requirements of cucurbits is met partly by N- fixing through the activity of the nif gene and largely by the N-fixing microorganisms that inhabit their leaf surfaces. Mixed cropping is usually practised in riverbeds. Muskmelon and watermelon generally go together. Other cucurbits usually grown together are bottle gourd, cucumber, summer squash, bitter gourd, Indian squash or round melon (tinda), and long melon (kakri) in north India, ridge gourd in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh (Anonymous, 1980), and parwal in Bihar (Dubey and Pandey, 1973). Sometimes cowpea and tomato are also grown as intercrops. This mixed cropping has some advantages in that it gives the riverbed farmers continuos income from March to June and makes up for the failure of any one crop. But if diseases such as mildews and viruses occur, they can spread from one crop to another, and their control mat then becomes difficult. Riverbed cultivation continues to be carried out in the traditional manner. Many improved varieties of bottle gourd, muskmelon, watermelon, pumpkin and bitter gourd have been developed by various research institutes, but they have yet to be evaluated and adopted in diara lands. There is tremendous scope for demonstration in the potato, in which the riverbed cultivators get average yields of 67–70 t/ha, whereas the national yield level is less than 20 t/ ha and world levels are about 37 t/ha. This is being achieved by use of improved cultivars, application of nutrients and most important, judicious management of water. The effects of improved cultivars and modern cultivation practices on production of cauliflower, radish and bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) in the riverbed areas of Birbhum district of west Bengal, were investigated during 1995–1998. The use of new technology increased  HORTICULTAURAL CROPS the production and yields, with percentage returns of 30% more than in the conventional system. Cauliflower cultivation was more suitable for farmers with moderate resources, and bitter gourd production, being the least cost intensive, was more suitable for resource-poor farmers (Nayak et al. 1999). of the options with respect to each criterion was done with scoring pattern of 0–10. The data obtained from key informants (20) are presented in Table 1. Cultivation of cucurbits in sandy condition, i.e. riverbed near the bank, was ranked higher by farmers in comparison to other conditions of Table 2.
