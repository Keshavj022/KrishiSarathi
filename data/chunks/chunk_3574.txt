 In 2002, an outbreak of the two-spotted mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, occurred in orchards located in Himachal Pradesh. Analysis of spray records from the growers revealed that apple orchards where need- based sprays were implemented exhibited lower mite populations compared to those subjected to excessive spraying. Research findings indicated that the development of T. urticae progressed at a faster rate in apple orchards compared to P. ulmi. Orchards that received a large number of sprays experienced a complete outbreak of T. urticae, leading to the decline of natural enemies and unhindered mite development. Additionally, the scarcity of rainfall during June-July further contributed to the multiplication of T. urticae. Previously, the P. ulmi and T. urticae held minor significance in apple orchards until the 1980â€™s. However, with the increased usage of pesticides, primarily insecticides, outbreaks of these mite species have been observed. The European red mite exhibits a polyphagous nature and inflicts damage on various deciduous fruits such as apricot, plum, walnut, pear, peach, and apple. The two-spotted mite displays a high degree of polyphagy and has been reported to feed on various crops like vegetables, fruits and ornamental plants. The extent of yield reduction caused by phytophagous mites varies across different crop types. For instance, brinjal may experience yield losses ranging from 13% to 31%, bhendi from 23% to 25%, gourd at 36%, cucumber at 14%, ornamental crops from 5% to 15%, tea from 5% to 50%, cereals from 5% to 50%, sugarcane from 5% to 20% and cotton from 20% to 30%. Factors responsible for making mites a major pest Adaptability: Mites possess remarkable adaptability and display rapid evolution, enabling them to successfully exploit new environments and feed on novel plant species. With the introduction of new plant species or modifications to existing crops, mites can undergo evolutionary changes to exploit these newfound food sources. Consequently, this can result in an increase in mite populations and the subsequent damage inflicted upon crops. High Reproduction Rate: Numerous mite species exhibit short life cycles and possess the ability to reproduce at a rapid pace, facilitating the rapid buildup of large populations within a short period. This phenomenon can result in substantial crop damage and pose challenges in effectively managing mite populations through conventional pest management approaches. Climate and Environmental factors: Elevated temperatures and prolonged growing seasons provide favourable conditions for rapid mite population growth. Similarly, shifts in precipitation patterns can impact the availability of water for plants, subsequently affecting mite populations. Notably, the multiplication of T.
