 This was supported by other studies that mentioned that parboiling might increase RS levels in rice [111]. Other investigations demonstrated that parboiling increased RS and decreased RDS. After 10 min of pressure cooking, the RS content dramatically increased to 7.95%, with a minor increase in SDS [7]. The high proportion of resistant starch (RS) or dietary ﬁbers and proteins might alter intestinal incretin hormones (such as GLP1 and GIP) and control insulin release [110,112]. Phytic acid (PA), which accounts for 80% of the phosphorus in seeds, functions as an antinutrient and inhibits the proper absorption of nutrients from the diet [9,113,114]. Parboiled brown rice (PBR) PA content is approximately half that of BR [115,116]. Thus, a high PA content can reduce the bioavailability of minerals and other nutrients. In addition, after the absorption of nutrients during processing, the amount of Se in 100 g of parboiled rice is 9.3 g, which is approximately 1.6 times more than that in brown rice. Selenium (Se), upon incorporation into selenoproteins, contributes to the activation and proliferation of cells engaged in immune response and anticancer mechanisms by mitigating inﬂammation generated by reactive oxygen species [117,118]. Therefore, it aids immunoregulation, avoiding autoimmunity and chronic inﬂammation [118]. Moreover, it increases thyroid hormone metabolism, cardiovascular, and neural health [118–120]. While dietary Se is often found in cereals, vegetables, ﬁsh, meat, dairy products, etc., and is vital to our health, excessive Se could be hazardous [118]. Calcium levels in parboiled rice are six times higher than in brown rice [9]. According to [121], calcium-rich diets are an effective treatment for osteoporosis because they minimize the incidence of osteoporotic fractures. In addition, calcium supplements have been shown to reduce the prevalence of gestational hypertension, which is frequent in women with gestational diabetes [122,123]. This reduces smooth muscle contractility, lowering preterm birth, which is associated with mother and infant mortality [122]. In addition, since parboiled rice is 25% higher in vitamin B6 than brown rice, it is an excellent source [9]. Several primary beneﬁts of having a vitamin B5-rich diet were its antioxidant capacity and antitumor actions via reduced cell proliferation and angiogenesis [124]. It is required to manufacture neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Vitamin B6 is related to a lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), in addition to its other advantages [124]. Vitamin B6 is effective in reducing hypertension/high blood pressure. Furthermore, brown rice is already known to be consumed due to its perceived health beneﬁts. A study comparing the digestibility of both parboiled and brown rice was conducted.
