 yy Developed a novel herbal “Formulation for the treatment of dermal mycoses in camel” (Patent No. 347971). yy 314 microbes deposited in NCVTC, Hisar repository. yy Technology of CSF cell culture vaccine and live attenuated sheeppox vaccine (Srin 38/00) were transferred to two firms. yy During the year, 5 patents were granted. yy Vaccine candidates for Covid, Lumpy Skin Disease and Japanese Encepalitis have been developed. yy Developed diagnostic Lateral Flow Rapid Test kit for Avian Influenza H5 Virus Antigen and PPR Surveillance ELISA kits (PPR Ab Chek kit and PPR Ag Chek Kit) for small ruminants. yy Disease monitoring and surveillance of exotic and emerging diseases:   FMD: 82063 samples tested in Sero-surveillance from 23 states and Sero-monitoring was conducted in 74878 samples.   Avian Influenza (AI): 34, 721 samples from 18 States tested for H5N1.   Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD): 493 bovine samples (cattle & buffalo) from 43 districts in eight states were tested.   African Swine Fever (ASF): 104 tissue/blood samples from NE states were tested for disease outbreaks in pigs.   Tested 10813 samples for EIA and 11433 for Glanders from different states of India. yy Commercialised a chemical formulation ‘Argcure’ against ectoparasite, Argulus. The product eradicates over 85% infection after second dose of application. yy Developed formulation ‘OoNIL’ for controlling Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome (EUS), which is one of the most destructive diseases of freshwater and brackish water fish in the Asia- Pacific region. yy Developed vaccine against Viral Nervous Necrosis (VNN) in brackishwater fishes. VNN is a serious viral disease affecting many marine, brackishwater and freshwater fishes resulting in 100% mortality in larval and early juvenile stages. 18 DARE–ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2021-22 9. Blue Revolution India is second largest fish producing and largest shrimp exporting country in the world. However, foreseeing the untapped potential to increase productivity and production from aquaculture and fisheries resources, Hon’ble Prime Minister called for a revolution and has named it as “Blue Revolution”. ICAR is technically backstopping the revolution through eight dedicated fisheries research institutes engaged in developing, refining and disseminating need-based technologies. The contribution made during the year is briefly presented below: yy Developed breeding and seed production technologies for two cultivable marine species viz. Picnic bream (Acanthopagrus berda) and Banded grunter (Pomadasys furcatus) and one freshwater species; Peninsular carp (Labeo kontius). yy Developed breeding and seed production technologies of three marine ornamental fish species, viz., Azure damsel (Chrysiptera hemicyanea), Sea Goldie (Pseudanthias squamipinnis) and Cloudy damsel (Dascyllus carnieus), and one freshwater species, i.e. Indian spiny eel (Macrognathus pancalus).
