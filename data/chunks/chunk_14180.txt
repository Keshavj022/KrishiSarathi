 Two studies on organic carbon and sediment geochemistry from coastal Gujarat (Banerji et al., 2017, 2019) also indicate a warm humid climate and enhanced monsoon precipita­ tion between ca. 1000 to 1500 CE, followed by an arid event between ca. 1600 to 1800 CE that the study authors correlate with the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age respectively. Also in southern Gujarat, sediment size classes and variations in terrestrial and marine paly­ nofacies have been interpreted as indicating warm humid conditions between ca. 600 to 1600 CE, with weaker monsoon precipitation indi­ cated during the last 400 years (Thakur et al., 2019). Pollen data from Mandovari lake at Chandravati in southern Rajas­ than, around 80 km north of Vadnagar indicate a shift from tropical deciduous forests to drier open grasslands at around 1500 CE (Pokharia et al., 2020), interpreted as evidence of weakened summer monsoon precipitation, also correlated with the LIA. From archaeological contexts at Chandravati, a shift in phytolith abundances from Panicoid to Chloridoid grasses and a decline in Cyperaceae are indicators of increasingly arid conditions locally after ca. 1400 CE. These shifts are concomitant with a major change in relative abundances of crop plants among the macrobotanical assemblage, from large-grained winter/­ summer cereals prior to 1400 CE to small-grained summer millets after this time. Oxygen stable isotope (δ18O) records from Himalayan cave speleo­ thems at Mawmluh (Kathayat et al., 2022) and Sahiya (Kathayat et al., 2017) have been interpreted as indicating Indian Summer Monsoon variation over the last 2000 years. At Sahiya (Kathayat et al., 2017), declining δ18O values from ca. 250 to 500 CE are interpreted as weakening monsoonal precipitation, followed by an in increase until ca. 1000 CE, argued to be correlated with the Medieval Warm Period. A subsequent decline is correlated with the Little Ice Age at around 1600 CE. In the Mawmluh record (Kathayat et al., 2022), minima in δ18O at around 1600 CE and another sharp decline lasting around 100 years from 1700 CE have been correlated with several periods of multi-decadal drought in the historic record and associated with the Little Ice Age. Environmental signals in the phytolith data from Vadnagar are generally consistent with these regional climatic changes. During the Historic phase (200 BCE−500 CE), the relative proportion of Panicoid phytoliths was highest with Chloridoid types being the lowest, sug­ gesting mesic vegetation around the site. Cyperaceae phytoliths were present in higher proportions in this zone, also indicating a warm and humid climate. An Iph value ranging from 22 to 28%, supports this interpretation and likely results from stable monsoon conditions. In the following Medieval phase (500−1300 CE), a slight decrease in Panicoid phytoliths was seen and an increase Chloridoid phytoliths may represent a landscape with a higher abundance of arid adapted grasses.
