 They suck sap from the foliage and results in curling of leaves for management apply Imidacloprid 17.8SL @60ml or Fipronil@200ml/200Ltr of water. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 154 Fruit Rot is major disease of tomato observed due to changing weather. To control spray of Mancozeb@400gm or Copper Oxychloride@300gm. Repeat spray in 15 days interval. Early Blight: Initially small, brown isolated spots are observed on leaf. Later spots are seen on stem and on fruits. If infestation of early blight is observed, spray Mancozeb@400gm or Tabuconazol@200ml/200Ltr. Repeat spray 10-15 days after first spray. Cauliflower It can grow well in wide range of soil from sandy loam to clay. pH of soil should be 6 to 7. Add lime in case of low pH soil. Early varieties: Early Kunwari, Pant Gobhi, Pusa Deepali Mid Early Varieties: Pusa Hybrid- 2, Pusa Sharad, Pant Gobhi- 4 Mid Late: Pusa Shubhra, Pusa Himjyoti, Punjab Giant 35 Late Varieties: Pusa snowball-1, Pusa snowball K-1 August to mid-September and October to first week of November is best transplanting time. Use spacing of 45x45 cm and seed rate is 250 gm per acre is required. Apply FYM @250-300q/ha, Nitrogen @100-150kg/ha, Phosphorus @ 60-80kg/ha and Potassium @ 80kg/ha. Half quantity of N and entire quantity of P and K are applied to the soil at the time of field preparation. The remaining half quantity of N is top dressed four weeks after transplanting. Borax @ 15 kg/ha and ammonium molybdate @ 15 kg/ha should also be applied in deficient soil of boron and molybdenum, respectively. Browning (Brown Rot or Red Rot) caused by boron deficiency which is influenced by soil pH. This may be controlled by application of borax or sodium borate @ of 20 kg/ha in soil application. Deficiency of molybdenum causes ‘whiptail’ syndrome, especially, in highly acidic soils. Application of lime and ammonium molybdate at the rate of 1-2 kg/ha as soil application. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 155 Buttoning: Development of small curds with inadequate foliage in cauliflower is known as buttoning. Transplanting of more than 6-week-old seedlings. Planting early varieties in late and vice versa leads buttoning. Diamond back moth is serious pest of cauliflower. They lay eggs under surface of leaves. In case of lack of proper control measures, it causes loss up to 80-90%. In severe infestation spray Spinosad 2.5%SC@80ml/150Ltr of water. Leaf spot and Blight: If infestation of blight is observed to control do spray of Mancozeb or Copper oxychloride @ 300gm/150 Ltr along with 20 ml sticker. Cabbage A pH range of 6.0-6.5 is considered as optimum for growing cabbage. Plants growing in saline soils are prone to diseases. A temperature range of 15- 21 degree C is considered as optimum for growth and head formation of the crop. Varieties: Golden acre, Pusa Drumhead, Pride of India, Pusa Mukta, Pusa Synthetic, Early Drumhead, Late Large Drum Head, K-1 are some of the varieties. Early cabbage is sown during July-November.
