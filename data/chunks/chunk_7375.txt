05%) rhizome yield (27.8 q/ha) as compared to check Symbolia. The beta-asarone content in APAc-5 is 15.9 mg/g. Mushrooms: A total of three strains, two in Button and one in Milky mushroom were released. DMR-button-14 and DMR-button-59 giving average yields of 23–25 kg and 22–24 kg/100 kg compost. The CROP IMPROVEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 56 two strains gave 15% and 9% yield increase over control. DMR Milky-985 has spherical pileus and long stipe, and higher average fruit body weight (47 g). The higher biological efficiency (55.7%) and 5.6% yield increase was observed in DMR Milky-985 as compared to control (52.6% BE). Biotechnology Plantation crops Medicinal plants Assessment of genetic diversity of madhunashinee (Gymnema sylvestre) germplasm by SSR markers: Of the 100 SSR markers used for screening of 26 genotypes of madhunashinee (Gymnema sylvestre), 58 primers produced alleles ranging from 1 to 6; with maximum number of alleles (6) being in XDAGSM10 showing maximum (0.602) polymorphic information content (PIC) and allelic diversity (0.662). It was followed by the XDAGSM55 having maximum PIC (0.607) and allelic diversity (0.671). These two are highly efficient polymorphic markers and can be used to distinguish the germplasm of G. Sylvester. Maximum genetic similarity value (0.968) was observed between genotypes DGS-21 and DGS-5 and minimum (0.384) between genotype DGS- 26 and DGS-17. Profile of XDAGSM10 primer with 26 germplasm of Gymnema sylvestre Profile of XDAGSM69 primer with 26 germplasm of Gymnema sylvestre Graphical annotation of draft genome sequence of cashew cv. Bhaskara Cashew Cashew genome assembly and annotation: For the first time, a draft genome sequence of the popular Indian cashew cv. Bhaskara was generated using the hybrid genome assembly approaches. The total genome assembled is about 385 Mb arranged in 4,981 scaffolds, with N50 value of 2.55 Mb. The gene prediction and annotation of the assembled genome revealed a total of 40,264 protein coding genes, of which 32,194 were annotated and 8,070 were un-annotated. Further, a total of 47,646 microsatellites were detected comprising of 59% of di-repeats followed by 24.4% tri-nucleotide, 3.6% of tetra-nucleotide, 1% of penta-nucleotide, and 0.8% of hexa-nucleotide repeats and 11.1% complex microsatellite motifs. The decoding of cashew genome forms the basis for genomics assisted breeding in cashew to improve yield, biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, altered plant stature, quality traits and other useful traits. New genomic SSR markers for Isabgol developed: Raw reads (24.3 gb) of the isabgol genome were downloaded from the SRA-NCBI database and de novo assembled using CLC software. There were 2,43,681 contigs sequences of 292,141,447 bp obtained with an N50 of 2,912 bp. SSR search using MISA yielded 3,14,206 SSRs with a frequency of 1.08/kb. Over 2,00,000 genomic SSR markers were developed of which 100 SSR markers validated by PCR amplification. K 6.
