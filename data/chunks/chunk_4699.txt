 Prerequisites for grafting Selection of compatible rootstock and scion. yy Grafting aids: Grafting clips, Tubes, Pins and Blade. yy Screening house: To grow seedlings prior to grafting. yy Healing Chamber: To provide 28-29oC temperature, 90-95% RH for 5-7 days, darkness for initial 1-2 days to promote callus formation and acclimatization of grafted seedlings. Biotic stress management yy S. torvum rootstock confers resistance to F. oxysporum f. sp. melongenae in brinjal scion against Verticillium and bacterial wilt. yy Interspecific hybrid rootstock ‘Brigeor’ controls root knot nematode in brinjal. yy Resistant brinjal rootstocks: Good for bacterial wilt resistance in tomato. yy Cucurbita moschata: Tolerance to both Fusarium wilt and Phytophthora blight in cucumber. yy Burr cucumber and African horned cucumber: Best nematode tolerance to most cucurbits. yy Wild Solanum sp. rootstock: Reduces white-fly transmitted virus symptoms in tomato.

New Known grafted onto sponge gourd showed flooding tolerance. Higher yield and improved quality yy Pumpkin rootstock gave 27% more marketable yield on cucumber seedlings. yy Watermelon grafted onto the bottle gourd exhibited 27-106% more yield over the control, while, grafting on Cucurbita spp. resulted in 127-240% reduction in fruit yield. Conclusion Grafting is a method of plant propagation which is site specific management tool for soil borne diseases and nematodes by utilising selective rootstock and scion combinations.
