5 and 19 per cent in the different varieties. A sugarcane crop is assured of irrigation in the tropics; in the subtropics, it is raised on protected irrigation 2-3 times in summer, excepting Punjab, where the crop is an irrigated one. Also, the high-sugared varieties are attacked by the red-rot and wilt. Borers also inflict the crop in menacing proportions. Researchers are thus looking for solutions and concentrating on: @ developing high-yielding high-sugar varieties tolerant to red-rot for the subtropics. Self-sufficiency in oilseeds is an example of an ideal mix of research policy and research per se. Improving the production to 22 million tonnes in 1992 from 8 million tonnes in 1986 has at present generated space for exports. Until 1990, we had been importing edible oils. Research in oilseeds has been going on since 1947. The Oilseeds Development Council has replaced the Indian Central Oilseeds Committee in 1966 while the All- India Coordinated Research Project added in 1967 has been upgraded to Directorate of Oilseeds Research in 1977. Our traditional oilseed crops have been: groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, sesame, linseed and castor. Together they yielded 5.16 million tonnes in 1951. With research input, the production has been improved by 13 million tonnes in 4 decades. THE OIL CROP THAT HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE : SOYBEAN The nation has witnessed a turnaround in edible oil scenario. The oil crop that has made all the difference is soybean: Year Area Production Yield ('000 ha) (‘000 tonnes) (kg/ha) 1980-81 608 442 728 1993-94 4,320 4,365 1,050 % increase 610 887 39 The crop was introduced into India in AD 1000. Its resurrection as an oil crop of consequence has been due to the research and development efforts put in by the ICAR during the last decade making the country the fifth largest producer of the soybean internationally. Although the Al-ndia Coordinated Research Project on Soybean came up in 1967, the National Research Centre (NRC) for Soybean has been set up much later, in 1987 at Indore, Madhya Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh has since come to be known as the “soybean state”, where the soybean crop is primarily rainfed. The NRC maintains 2,500 accessions of the crop. Fifty improved varieties suited to different agroclimates are now available to the farmers across the country, with NRC 2, JS 80-21, JS 335 and PB 1 capable of producing adequate plant population for higher yields. Poor seed longevity in soybean is an inherent problem in the tropics. The scientists have taken care of the anamoly in their breeding programme. Pod shattering, a post- harvest problem, has also been countered genetically by the researchers. The ongoing priorities revolve on build-up of the soybean germplasm collection, maintenance and evaluation, breeding of varieties with an extended juvenile period, prolonged life of seed and resistance to pod-shattering, insect pests and diseases.
