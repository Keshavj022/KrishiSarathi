 The identification of dry, normal and wet episodes becomes much more apparent in SPI-12 due to its cumulative duration, which shows a long-term drought trend (hydrological drought), therefore, for the pre­ sent study SPI-12 were considered. Drought events were considered when the SPI-12 value was < 1.0 for two consecutive months till the value became positive. A perusal of Fig. 2 indicate that, 5 major drought events (1986–88, 1989–90, 1992, 1999–2001, 2002–03) in ACZ I, 4 in ACZ II (1987–88, 1992, 1993, 1999–2003) and 6 in (1987–88, 2002–03, 2004–07, 2009–10, 2014–15 and 2016–18) ACZ III were identified in the present study. Spatial distribution maps of SPI for the growing season of wheat (December-March) from 2001-02 to 2019-20 is shown in Fig. 3. It is evident from the Fig. 3, that SPI varied spatially, and each zone endured drought events at different times. The driest spell of SPI (< −2.0) to the wettest spell (SPI >2.0) varied significantly in all the ACZs. However, the year 2008–09 was the wet year for all the ACZs, but the spatial extent of wetness was larger in the ACZ I and ACZ II. In ACZ III, 2011–12 was the wettest year, with maximum precipitation in the northern part of the study area. As far as the drought events are concerned, all the zones experienced the rabi season drought on temporally different scales. The driest year for ACZ I, ACZ II and ACZ III were 2002–03, 2014–15 and 2016–17, respectively and therefore, being the driest years, these were selected for the further analysis to determine the impact of drought events on VHI, NVSWI and GPP. 3.3. Dynamics of NDVI, LST, VCI, TCI, VHI and GPP from 2001-02 to 2019-20 NDVI could be utilized as a robust parameter for monitoring soil surface moisture, allowing drought occurrences to be easily identified. The mean NDVI value in the ACZ I was lowest in 2002–03, while the highest mean NDVI and good vegetation cover were recorded in 2018–19. The lowest seasonal mean NDVI was observed in ACZ II and ACZ III in 2001–02, whereas good vegetation growth was observed in the years 2018–2020. The ACZ I had the lowest NDVI (0.20) values every year, whereas the ACZ II was found to be the greenest of the three ACZs for the chosen time period. From 2013-14 onwards, good vege­ tation growth (NDVI > 0.60) was observed in the ACZ I, and from 2017–2020, the entire study area had a healthy vegetation cover. VCI (Fig. 4) also indicated the highest values of VCI during this period. The increase in good vegetation cover from 2017 onwards could be attrib­ uted to near-normal rainfall during these years, as seen in Fig. 3, where SPI values for the whole research area were almost normal throughout these years. The growing season NDVI analysis reveals that the ACZ I L. Kaur et al. Agricultural Water Management 274 (2022) 107956 7 had poor vegetation cover for the majority of the years, whereas ACZ II has reasonably good vegetation cover.
