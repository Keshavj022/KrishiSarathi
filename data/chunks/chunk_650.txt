 If past trends are any indication, it may be visualized that in future also the major gain in production, at least 80% of the incremental food need required by 2025, has to come from irrigated ecosystem where new climate resilient crops/cropping systems with climate resilient varieties and intensive nutrients use will continue to play dominant role in enhancing crop productivity. The major crops are having sizeable percentage of area under irrigation in the country; sugarcane (87.9%), wheat (84.3%), barley (60.8%), rapeseed and mustard (57.5%), rice (46.8%), tobacco (41.2%), cotton (33.2%), chickpea (21.9%), maize (21.8%) and groundnut (19.2%). Among the states, Punjab ranks first with 94.6% cropped area under irrigation followed by Haryana (76.4%) and Uttar Pradesh (62.3%). A large diversity of cropping systems exist under rainfed and dry land areas with an overriding practice of intercropping, due to greater risks involved in cultivating larger area under a particular crop. Due to prevailing socio-economic situations (such as dependency of large population on agriculture, small land holding size, very high population pressure on land resource etc.), improving household food security has been an issue of supreme importance to many farmers of India, which constitute 56.15 mha (<1.0 ha), 17.92 mha (1.0–2.0 ha) and 13.25 mha of semi medium (2.0–4.0 ha) farm holdings, making together 90% of 97.15 million operational holdings. An important consequence of this has been that crop production in India remained to be considered, by and large, a subsistence rather than commercial activity.
