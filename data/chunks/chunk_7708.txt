 The powder at one, two, five, ten, fifteen and 20% concentration was tested for its efficacy in managing bruchid beetle along with untreated control. Observations were taken on egg laying and pod damage. Pods treated with 20% sweet flag rhizome powder recorded lowest number of eggs. Sweet flag rhizome powder of 10% and above concentration was found significantly superior and recorded 18% pod damage as compared to 64.2% damage in untreated control. Toxicity of nanosilica on hairy caterpillar: Six different concentrations of nanosilica, viz. 10 ppm, 1 ppm, 0.1 ppm, 0.01 ppm, 10-3 ppm and 10-4 ppm were prepared. Uniform third instar larvae of hairy caterpillar (HC) (Spilosoma obliqua) were used for determining the toxicity of nano silica on them. Ten larvae were exposed on fresh jute leaves as feed in petriplates that were sprayed with different concentrations of nano silica @ 5 ml/plate by an atomizer. After 24 h, fresh leaves were provided for feeding. After 48 h of spray the weight of nanosilica treated larvae of HC showed considerable reduction as compared to the untreated larvae. The highest body weight reduction of 64.41% was noticed in case of nanosilica spray @ 10 ppm followed by 1 ppm (62.93%) and 0.1 ppm (37.31%). The lowest body weight reduction (4.55%) was recorded in case of 10-4 ppm nanosilica. After 72 h of spray, the highest mortality of 75% was recorded in case of 10 ppm followed by 73.33% in case of 1 ppm. Even in case of 10-4 ppm nanosilica spray application there was 16.67% mortality. The LC50 of nanosilica was as low as 0.0000097% of a.i. It was lower than most of the commonly used insecticides such as indoxacarb, cypermethrin, emamectin benzoate etc. Widespread practice of IPM: Horizontal spread of IPM in Basmati rice in 488 ha by participation of 450 farmers in six villages in Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh resulted in reduction of chemical pesticide application from a.i. 791.2 g/ha in farmers’ practices (FP) to a.i. 60.1 g/ha in IPM, and enhanced paddy yield and B/C ratio by 19.7% and 47.7% respectively over FP. Validation of IPM in basmati rice (Pusa 1509) at Uttarakhand in 16 ha resulted in 25% reduction in chemical pesticide application, and 35.8% and 40.6% increase in paddy yield and B/C ratio, respectively, over FP. IPM interventions resulted in significant reduction CROP MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 72 High arsenic tolerant bacteria from arsenic polluted soils of Ballia: Arsenic polluted regions of Ballia district in Eastern UP were found to contain arsenic at the concentration of 400 mg/kg of soil. Bacterial diversity from soil were cultured and 25 distinct bacterial isolates obtained were characterized for tolerance to different concentrations of arsenate and arsenite (source sodium arsenate and sodium (Meta) arsenite, respectively) through minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test. Five very potential isolates, viz.
