 Keywords: Organic agriculture, inorganic farming, random-effect model, meta-analysis, cumulative meta-analysis Introduction Globally, various analyses, including the United Nations-led International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science, and Technology for Development (IAASTD) in 2008 and the High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (HLPE) in 2019, have raised significant concerns regarding the sustainability of current chemical and input-intensive agricultural models. These reports stress that continuing with agriculture as usual is no longer an option, particularly in light of alarming projections such as the 2015 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimate that only 60 harvest years remain due to soil degradation. The urgency of reforming food systems has been highlighted, with agro-ecology, an approach that applies ecological principles to agricultural systems, being proposed as a comprehensive solution. Agro-ecology is seen as key to achieving food sovereignty, addressing issues such as hunger, poverty, climate change, and biodiversity loss. It is increasingly being recognized as a holistic approach that not only contributes to sustainable food systems but also supports the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. Organic agriculture, a significant component of agro- ecology, promotes the health of soils, ecosystems, and people by relying on natural processes rather than harmful inputs (Srivastava 2023) [18]. It integrates traditional knowledge, innovative science, and ecological principles to create a sustainable and equitable food system. The core principles of organic agriculture include using nature as a model for farming, maintaining soil fertility, preserving wildlife and their habitats, and enhancing genetic diversity (Thakur et al. 2022) [19]. Unlike conventional agriculture, which often depends on synthetic inputs, organic farming emphasizes locally adapted, environmentally sustainable practices (Gamage et al. 2023) [10]. This approach not only aims to produce high-quality food but also seeks to improve the overall quality of life for all stakeholders involved. In contrast, inorganic agriculture focuses on maximizing yield and profit through the use of man-made chemicals like pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic fertilizers, often at the International Journal of Agriculture Extension and Social Development https://www.extensionjournal.com 322 www.extensionjournal.com expense of long-term environmental and soil health (Soni et al. 2022) [17]. In India, organic agriculture has deep historical roots and significant potential for growth in both national and international markets. Despite its rich tradition, organic farming in India remains in its infancy, with only 2% of the country's net sown land being farmed organically. The Indian government has made efforts to promote organic farming, primarily through export-focused strategies and third-party certification systems.
