in 12 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science • Farmers are getting more benefits with linseed + gram/lentil (3 : 1 or 1 : 3) intercropping system under rainfed situation and linseed + mustard (5:1) under irrigated situation as compared to sole croppings. • Farmers are getting higher net monetary return per unit area by adopting paddy – linseed (U.P., Bihar, Jharkhand), black gram – linseed (Jharkhand), soybean – linseed (MP, Chhatisgarh, Maharashtra), maize – linseed and Til – linseed crop rotation as compared to after rotations involving linseed III. PROTECTION TECHNOLOGY : DISEASES : Linseed crop is attacked by a number of pathogens but four diseases viz., Alternaria blight and rust in northern India and wilt & powdery mildew in central and peninsular regions are most damaging. The main research was focused on the management of these diseases and salient achievements are given as under : HOST RESISTANCE More than 2045 germplasm, breeding material and varieties were screened against major diseases and the material found resistant/tolerant are given disease wise as under‐ Wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini.) Varieties : Kiran, R‐552, J‐23, Jeevan, LC‐54, Nagarkot, Padmini, Surabhi, T‐397. Germplasm : 12 Jabalpur 1986, H‐22, NP‐47, NP(RR)‐65. Alternaria leaf and bud blight (Alternaria lini) Varieties : K‐2, Himalini, Jeevan, Gaurav, Nagarkot, Meera, Parvati, Rashmi, Sheela and Surabhi Germplasm : Ayogi, BAU‐610 A, ES‐44, H‐34, H‐43, Polf‐19, Polf‐22. Powdery mildew (Oidium lini) Varieties : Himalini, J‐23, Kiran, R‐552, Nagarkot, Meera, Padmini, Parvati, Sheela and Surabhi Germplasm : A‐127, ES‐44, H‐34, KL‐2045, KL‐2057, LCK‐8776, LCK‐8722, LCK‐89512, NHPY‐10, NP(RR)‐412, LH‐1, Mahoba local, Mayurbhanj local. Rust (Melampsora lini) Varieties : LC‐185, J‐23, Himalini, Him‐Alsi, Jeevan, Meera, Nagarkot, Sheela and Surabhi Germplasm : 9x11, 5/47‐2‐2/10, Ayogi, ES‐44, KL‐178, Polf ‐5, Polf‐19, RLC‐73. CHEMICAL CONTROL : The salient results are given as under – Wilt : Seed treatment with Thiram (3g/kg seed) or Bavistin (1 g/kg seed) or Topsin M (2‐3 g/kg seed) has been found effective. www.icar.org.in 13 2002 ‐ 2007 Alternaria blight : Seed treatment before sowing with Topsin M (2.5g/kg seed) and 2‐3 sprays of Indofil M‐45 (0.25%) or Rovral (0.2%) after onset of disease at 10‐15 days interval. Powdery mildew : Three sprays of wettable sulphur (0.3%) or calixin (0.1%) on disease appearance at 10‐15 days interval. Rust : Seed treatment with Oxycarboxin (0.2%) before sowing and 2‐3 sprays of calixin (0.1%) or mancozeb (0.25%) on disease appearance at 10‐15 days interval BIOLOGICAL CONTROL Seed treatment with Trichoderma viride or T. harzianum alone or in combination with Thiram, sown in fields amended with FYM (@ 5 t/ha) have been found very effective in management of disease. INTEGRATED DISEASE MANAGEMENT OF ALTERNARIA BLIGHT Sowing of resistant/tolerant varieties, seed treated with Topsin‐M (2.
