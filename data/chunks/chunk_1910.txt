LTE- M (eMTC) enables the broadest range of loT capabilities and NB-loT scales down further in cost and power for low-end loT use cases. Low power consumption and long-range capabilities make NB-loT well-suited for applications in remote agricultural areas, providing farmers with valuable data to make informed decisions and optimize their farming practices. Few applications of NB- loT in agriculture are Soil Health Monitoring, Crop Health Monitoring, Livestock Tracking, Weather Stations, Smart Irrigation, Asset/ livestock Tracking, Precision Farming, Water Quality Monitoring, etc. 2.1.3. 5G/ IMT 2020 5G is an emerging communication technology introduced in 3GPP Release 15. 5G Technology is evolving in various 3GPP releases as shown in figure 8 below- TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 10 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 11 (Source: Qualcomm) Figure 8: 5G Technology evolution Table 2: Summary of 5G related 3GPP Releases and their main features Rel 15 eMBB focus •5G NR foundation •Sub-7 and mmWave •Scalable & forward compatible •Basic URLLC support •mMTC via eMTC & NB-IoT Rel 16 industry expansion •Unlicensed spectrum (NR-U) •Enhanced URLLC •New functionalities: Sidelink (NR V2X), Positioning 5G broadcast •eMTC/NB-IoT with 5G core •Topology: IAB •eMBB enh: MIMO, device power, CA/DC, mobility Rel 17 continued expansion •mmWave extended to 71GHz •Lower complexity “NR- Light” (RedCap) •Non-terrestrial communication (satellites): NR NTN and NTN IoT •Improved IIoT, positioning, V2X •Enhanced IAB, RF repeaters Rel 18+ 5G Advanced •Next set of 5G releases (i.e., 18, 19, 20, …) •Rel-18 scope decided in Dec ’21 5G provides faster speed, lower latency, and wider coverage. The requirements for 5G broadly cover three main usage scenarios as shown in in figure 9-  Mobile IoT/ Massive IoT/ LPWAN: improved network coverage, long device operational life time and a high density of connections. This is also known as Massive MTC (mMTC).
