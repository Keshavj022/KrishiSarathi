 Coating of important compounds around seed is one of the successful and established delivery methods of agricultural inputs. Study was undertaken to assess the nanoparticle delivery through seed coating (polymer-based method) in chickpea (Cicer arietinum). The study was initiated with chemical driven synthesis, characterization and coating of ZnO NPs. The work was further followed by evaluation of coated NPs’ impact on germination and growth of chickpea along with influence on rhizospheric bacteria. In this context, the impact of nano-based seed coating on Zn responsive gene expression was also assessed. The size of the synthesized ZnO NPs was 79 nm determined through Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) technique. To study the germination percentage (%), a dose ranged between 25 to 250 ppm was considered. Amongst these doses, 25 ppm of ZnO NPs exhibited 100% germination with the highest root and plumule length. In the same dosage, the microbial consortia in rhizospheric soil exhibited sustainable profiling and highest antioxidant activity in SOD and CAT enzyme assay, i.e. 5.50 and 0.30 units/ mg. Leaves and seeds coated with 25 ppm of ZnO NPs showed highest accumulation rate, i.e. 0.035 and 0.04 mg/g estimated through ICP-OES and exhibited higher expression of zinc responsive genes (SOD, ZIF-1, HMA3, VOZ). Based on these findings, this ZnO NPs dose can be recommended for the improvement of yield and germination in chickpea. Crop Protection Novel oil-based entomopathogenic fungal bio- insecticide formulations for management of CLCuD vector B. tabaci: Entomopathogenic fungal isolates (EPFs) were collected from whitefly cadavers through the survey in the North cotton-growing zone of India and from NBAIM and ITCC. A pool of 373 EPFs was evaluated for their bioefficacy against whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) under polyhouse. The most virulent EPFs were also evaluated for their compatibility with 17 insecticides Efficacy of Vip3Aa proteins for the control of agronomically important lepidopteran pests Four full length vip3-type genes vip3Aa44, vip3Aa67, vip3Aa69 and vip3Aa70 (NCBI GenBank Accession Numbers HQ650163, MN120477, MN120479 and MN120481, respectively) were isolated from Bacillus subsp thuringiensis (A6) and Bt isolates SK-792, SK- 986 and SK-851, recovered from diverse habitats in India. These genes were overexpressed in E. coli and the efficacy of these proteins was evaluated. The Vip3Aa proteins showed LC50 ranging from 0.91 µg/g to 10.59 µg/g to Helicopverpa armigera (cotton bollworm, pod borer) and LC50 of 3.53 µg/g to 20.18 µg/g towards Spodoptera litura (cotton leafworm). These Vip3Aa proteins caused growth retardation and sub-lethal effects such as malformed, decreased, delayed pupation and adult formation at different developmental stages in the whole life cycle of H. armigera and S. litura. These vip3Aa genes have potential in deployment for crop protection for lepidopteran pest control. Growth retardation and reduction in larval weight of S.
