Farmers faced: • Initial skepticism: Many were hesitant to adopt new practices, fearing reduced yields and income loss. • Limited resources: Access to materials and markets posed significant challenges. • Climate change: Unpredictable weather patterns and droughts threaten crop stability. However, with the guidance and support of KVK (Kiphire) under Farmer FIRST Programme, farmers persevered, adapting to the challenges and finding innovative solutions. As farmers began to adopt nutrigarden practices, a remarkable transformation unfolded. Within a year, over 500 farmers established their own nutrigardens, covering an area of 200 ha.
