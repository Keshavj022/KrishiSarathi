Days required to initiate flowering Early initiation of flowering in new shootlets was also recorded in summer bending of branch (36.4 days) than autumn bending (45.2 days). Earliness in initiation of flowering was also observed in other treatments in summer season (Table 4). Days required for fruit set The fruit set was also advanced by 9 days during bending summer season as compared to bending in autumn season (Table 4). Other treatments also showed similar trend of variation Pair of new leaves produced per shootlet at flowering time The maximum pair of leaves was produced at flowering time with control plants (8.1) during summer season. However, other treatments also showed slight increment in pair of leaves/shootlet during summer season of bending than autumn season. Number of shootlets with flower buds per branch About 83% of the newly emerged shoots produced flower buds during autumn bending (Table 4) whereas only 48.42% of the newly  HORTICULTURAL CROPS emerged shoot produced flower buds during bending in summer season. During summer season due to warm and humid condition the newly emerged shoot made excess growth, having more than 5_6 pairs of leaves at flowering time and became vegetative shoot instead of producing flowers in them. Number of flowers per shootlet The number of flowers/shootlet was found to increase in autumn season of bending (8.3) as compared to summer bending (6.8). Similar change of variation was recorded in other two treatments (Table 4). Number of fruits per branch at fruit-set stage The maximum fruitset/branch (56.5) was observed in autumn season of bending at fruit set stage than summer bending (39.6) during autumn season (Table 4). Increased fruit set was also recorded in all the treatments. The increment of fruit set in autumn season was due to number of shootlet with flower buds as well suitable environmental condition reduced fruit drop at fruit set stage. Number of fruits per shootlet The number of fruits per shootlet was also higher in autumn season of bending (6.7) than summer bending (4.2). Other treatments followed the same trend of variation in this regard (Table4). Number of fruits retained up to harvest per branch It was found that bending of branches during autumn produced maximum number of fruits retention (18.7) at harvest than the other two treatments (Table 4). Number of fruits per plant at harvest Maximum number of fruits was recorded in bending of branches in autumn (225.0) as compared to other treatments, whereas T2 and T3 produced 110 and 21.
