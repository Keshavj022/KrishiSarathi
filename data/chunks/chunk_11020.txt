Govt. of India has recently announced a scheme viz. “Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana” for providing financial support to Integrated Bio-Ethanol Projects using lignocellulosic biomass & other renewable feedstock, with a total financial outlay of ` 1,969.50 crore for the period 2018-19 to 2023-24. The scheme focuses to incentivize 2G Ethanol sector and support this nascent industry by creating a suitable ecosystem for setting up commercial projects and increasing Research & Development in this area. Under this Yojana, 12 Commercial Scale and 10 demonstration scale Second Generation (2G) Ethanol Projects will be provided a Viability Gap Funding (VGF) support in two phases: a) Phase-I (2018-19 to 2022-23): wherein 6 commercial projects and 5 demonstration projects will be supported. b) Phase-II (2020-21 to 2023-24): wherein remaining 6 commercial projects and 5 demonstration projects will be supported. Other endeavours are also underway to provide necessary support to nascent 2G Ethanol industry. Cost Analysis of Alcohol Production from Paddy Straw Following are the basic information based on which the economic analysis PAU Model – I biogas plant was done: • The quantity of alcohol that can be produced from 1 ton of paddy straw is 200 litres. • The costs of plant and machinery for a 100,000 litre alcohol production capacity per day is about ` 800 to 1,000 crores (We shall take it as ` 900/- crores) • A 100,000 litre alcohol per day capacity plant will consume around 0.15 million tonnes of biomass per year and will produce around 300 lakh litres of ethanol per year. • Amount of compost manure produced as a by-product is 6 kg compost per litre of alcohol produced or 1800 lakh kg per year.
