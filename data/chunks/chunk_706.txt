 The models were validated and compared, and the best pipeline was selected for assessment of different soil attributes. • Development of in-house drone: Multirotor quadcopter design for agriculture health monitoring and surveying has been developed as part of project. It includes features like, real-time telemetry demonstration at any specified location, full HD live video transmission with dual camera support, all in one hand-held ground station for flying and mission planning. It has a payload capacity of 1.5 kg with a flight time of 40 to 45 minutes (without payload) and has the altitude capability of 120 m. measure the soil moisture at three different depths, viz. 20 cm, 40 cm and 60 cm. The mobile application pertaining to the irrigation scheduling was also developed in python and is under testing and subsequent debugging Digital agricultural knowledge dissemination system Agricultural knowledge dissemination systems are important for providing Indian farmers with the information they need to make informed decisions about their farming practices. Digital technologies can play an important role in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of these systems. In India, following systems are already being implemented by different organizations responsible for the same: • Mobile-based applications: Mobile applications can be developed to provide farmers with information on crop management practices, weather forecasts, market prices, and other relevant information. These applications can be designed to be user-friendly and accessible even for farmers with low literacy levels. • Interactive voice response (IVR) systems: IVR systems can be used to provide farmers with information on demand, using a telephone. This can be useful for farmers who do not have access to smartphones or the internet. IVR systems can also be designed to provide personalized recommendations based on the specific needs of each farmer. • Digital kiosks: Digital kiosks can be set up in rural areas to provide farmers with access to information on crop management practices, weather forecasts, market prices and other relevant information. These kiosks can be staffed by trained personnel who can assist farmers with accessing and interpreting information. • Farmer helplines: Farmer helplines can be set up to provide farmers with advice and support on a wide range of issues related to agriculture. These helplines can be staffed by trained agronomists and other agricultural experts who can provide personalized recommendations based on the specific needs of each farmer. • Social media: Social media platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp can be used to disseminate agricultural information to farmers. Farmers can join groups and communities on these platforms where they can share information and advice with each other, as well as receive updates on new agricultural practices and technologies.
