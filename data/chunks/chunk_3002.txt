 Sweet potato • In Kalyani, Dholi, Jorhat and Thiruvananthapuram, the experiment on biofertilizers in sweet potato revealed that application of 1/3rd or 2/3rd recommended N (60 kg N ha‐1) + 2 kg Azospirillum ha‐1 as vine dipping + 10 kg Azospirillum ha‐1 as soil application increased the marketable tuber yield as well as dry matter of tuber. • At Faizabad 30:40:60 NPK kg ha‐1 with 30 kg N by vermicompost and 45:40:60 NPK kg ha‐1 with 15 kg N by vermicompost gave maximum tuber yield • In an on farm trial of sweet potato based cropping system at Jagdalpur at four locations revealed that the treatment cowpea – sweet potato was found ideal sequence which produced 24.00 t ha‐1 tuber yield of sweet potato and 5.73 t ha‐1 green pod yield of cowpea. Sweet potato based cropping system research indicated that the vegetable cowpea and sweet potato gave maximum net return both at Faizabad and at Dapoli. Colocasia • Twenty to thirty grams of the seed size was found ideal yielding the maximum at all levels of nitrogen except the lower dose of 80 kg ha_1 in Colocasia (bunda )in Faizabad. • Half the recommended doze of P2O5 (30 kg) and full dose of N and K (120:120 kg ha‐1)with FYM (15 t ha‐1) and AM fungi (10 kg ha‐1) with or without Phosphobacteria(10 kg ha‐1)at Rajendranagar gave maximum cormel yield (17.75 t ha‐1) in taro. Colocasia –swamp taro • Application of Mahua cake (50kg N)+225 kg ha‐1N produced significantly higher stolon production of 20.86 t ha‐1 in swamp taro in Kalyani . Elephant foot yam • Vegetable cowpea + Elephant foot yam cropping system was found profitable in Faizabad , Jorhat, Coimbatore and Kalyani www.icar.org.in 16 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Horticulture • Application of karanj cake @500g plant ‐1 was found equally effective as that of 80:40:80 kg NPK ha‐1 in producing maximum corm yield at Ranchi • The fertilizer dose for intercropped EFY in coconut gardens was found to be optimum for maximum yield at 80:60:100 kg NPK ha‐1 at Port Blair • In Elephant foot yam application of 125:60:100 kg NPK ha‐1 with 50 kg N by FYM or vermicompost gave maximum corm yield (50.87 and 45.92 t ha‐1 respectively) at Faizabad. Vermicompost application was found to enhance the corm yield at Faizabad as well as at Kalyani. • A fertilizer dose of 120:60:60 kg NPK t ha‐1 with 5 kg FYM per pit of elephant foot yam gave maximum corm yield (35.8 t ha‐1) at Ranchi • At Navasari 150:60:150 kg NPK ha‐1 applied half as basal and the half at 60 DAP resulted in maximum corm yield (32.4 t ha‐1). • At Navasari 75 x 50 cm spacing and seed tuber size of one kg gave maximum yield (68 to 96 t ha‐ 1) when planted during early March. • At Faizabad 60 x 45 or 60 x 30 cm spacing and 175 or 200 g seed tuber size were found to be optimum for elephant foot yam cultivation. • In the trial on intercropping tuber crops in orchards, elephant foot yam was identified as an ideal intercrop in litchi orchards at Dholi.
