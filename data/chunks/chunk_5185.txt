 RESULT AND DISCUSSION Experiment Thirty-two calves were randomly assigned for the two treatments and for the two control groups of eight each. In Group I of 16 animals, 8 animals were given one teaspoonful of turmeric mixed in water on day 1 and day 2. In Group II of 16 animals, pepper powder was blown in the nostrils of 8 animals and 8 calves were taken as controls. Animals in Group I were clinically observed for 10 days for the occurrence of diarrhoea. Blood were collected from the calves on day 1 and day 10 for following hemato- biochemical parameters on: haemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), total erythrocyte count (TEC), total leucocyte count (TLC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, total protein, glucose, potassium, calcium and phosphorus.   VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY In Group II, the animals were blown with pepper powder in the nostrils and observed for 1 hour for improvement in the respiration rate and pulse rate. Blood samples were collected before and after treatment to study the Pco 2 level in the blood of the trial calves. All the 16 calves in Group I were apparently healthy, active and had good appetite. There was no evidence of diarrhoea both in the control and treatment groups during the period of study. Haematology Results obtained on haemogram, leucogram, blood chemistry, physiological parameters, and Pco 2 are given below. In haemogram, the mean values of packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin (Hb) and total erythrocytes count (TEC) were 28.5 ą 1.00%, 8.38 ą 0.47 g/dl and 6.26 ą 0.35 million /ml on day 1 and 30.63 ą 0.56%, 9.00 ą 0.25 g/dl and 7.12 ą 0.27 million/ml on day 10 respectively in the control animals (Table 1). There was no significant difference in the haemogram in this group. In the animals treated with turmeric, the mean values of PCV, Hb and TEC were 26.75 ą 0.94%, 8.0 ą 0.46 g/dl and 5.64 ą 0.23 millions / ml on day 1 and 30.38 ą 0.60%, 8.75 ą 0.25 g/dl and 6.18 ą 0.14 millions/ml on day 10 respectively (Table 2). Statistically there was no significant difference in the haemogram values in this group. Packed cell volume, haemoglobin and total erythrocyte count were elevated in calves with diarrhoea.They were not significantly elevated in the control and treated animals in this experiment , as there was no incidence of diarrhoea in the observation period. In leucogram, the mean value of the total leucocytic count (TLC) was 10,281 ą847/ml and 10,262 ą 598 / ml on day 1 and day 10 in the control animals (Table 1). It was 11,287 ą 633 and 10,812 ą431 in the treated animals on day 1 and day 10 respectively (Table2). There was no significant difference observed in these parameters. The mean values of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the control group on day 1 were 42.875 ą 0.855 % and 57.125 ą 0.74 % respectively (Table 1).In theanimals treated with turmeric water, the mean values of neutrophils and lymphocytes on day 1 were 43 ą 0.57% and 57 ą 0.57 % and on day 10 were 45.63 ą 1.22% and 54 ą 1.
