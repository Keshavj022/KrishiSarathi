 2020 and shown in Fig. 10. This suggests that August (Fig. 10a, d, g and j) is the wettest month and July to August (JAS; Fig. 10b, e, h and k) is the wettest season for the year of 2020. The spatially averaged values of SSMI, ESSMI, SPI and SPEI for August are 1.63, 1.54, 1.33 and 1.21 respectively and JAS are 1.68, 1.16, 1.58 and 0.96 respectively for 2020. The driest months and seasons within 2020 are May and AMJ respec- tively consistently identified by all the four indices. The comparison of these dry and wet periods shows that the satellite SM-based indices are able to represent the temporal variations of dryness/wetness in monthly and seasonal scales. However, an overall synchronous pattern in the general exposition of dry/wet conditions can be inferred among the four indices. This can be noted from a grid-by-grid Correlation Coefficient (CC) analysis and comparison among the four indices conducted (on a monthly scale) for the complete study period from 1991 to 2020 and are presented in Fig. 11. These CC values for all the grids are statistically significant at 95 % confidence level that is computed using the two- tailed Z-test. The median CC values from the box plots indicate that the CC values of all index pairs are centered on 0.5 or more indicating a moderate to strong correlation between all the index pairs. The inter- quartile ranges of the boxplots indicating the dispersion that the CC values of all index pairs are more tightly clustered around the median again showing consistency among all the index pairs. The box plots show Fig. 9. Spatial distributions of the drought indices across the SPH i.e. SSMI, ESSMI, SPI and SPEI for the driest month and season of the driest year of 2003 along with the annual distribution. H. Palagiri and M. Pal International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation 134 (2024) 104175 8 that SM-based drought indices i.e. SSMI and ESSMI have a strong posi- tive correlation with each other with a median CC value of 0.61 (Fig. 11a). The meteorological drought indices i.e. SPI and SPEI are also well correlated, with a median CC value of 0.54 (Fig. 11b). The narrow interquartile ranges (0.53 to 0.71 and 0.43 to 0.68 for 1st and 2nd cases respectively) show the consistencies in correlations for both the cases. The interquartile ranges of CC values between the remaining four index pairs shown in Fig. 11c to 9f are comparable (SSMI vs SPI is 0.56 to 0.69, SSMI vs SPEI −0.45 to 0.67, ESSMI vs SPI −0.52 to 0.64, ESSMI vs SPEI − 0.47 to 0.64) and indicate moderate to strong positive correlations with each other. These narrow interquartile ranges indicate a stable and robust correlation between agricultural (SM-based) and meteorological (precipitation and evapotranspiration based) drought indices. However, in terms of median values, SSMI tends to show a slightly stronger cor- relation with SPI (0.64, Fig. 11c) and SPEI (0.59, Fig. 11d), while compared to ESSMI (0.58 for SPI, Fig. 11e; and 0.
