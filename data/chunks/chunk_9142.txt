 Paclobutrazolfed mango trees in In mango ALPHONSO, the gene for spongy tissue is homozygous and bearing. These mango trees have no ; F s ‘ Gfiseacon recessive. It has been established by crossing ALPHONSO with BANGANPALLI, KALAPADY and JANARDHAN PASAND; susceptibility to spongy tissue has proved to be a recessive character. Mango malformation may be partially controlled by spraying Mangiferin -Zn 2 and Mangiferin -Cu 2+ chelates or by pruning the diseased portions and following up with a spray of Bavistin (0.1%) or Captaf (0.2%). BREEDERS CONCENTRATE ON HYBRIDS OF GRAPE... THOMPSON SEEDLESS, an ARKA KANCHAN introduction ARKA NEELMANI ARKA SHWET Improvements in grape have been aimed at developing hybrids resistant to diseases and for table consumption, raisin-, juice- or wine-making. More than 13,000 hybrid seedlings have been evaluated at the IIHR, Bangalore, for releasing grape hybrids ARKA KANCHAN, ARKA NEELMANI, ARKA SHWET, ARKA SONAKA, ARKA SOMA and ARKAVATI. The IIHR, Bangalore, maintains a ; germplasm collection of 606 species of ARKA SONAKA ARKA SOMA the grape and allied genera. ARKAVATI Prescribed use of grape guard prolongs the shelf-life of the fruits up to 12 weeks (right) in acid lime); papaya (Co Series 1-5, COORG HONEY DEW, PUSA DELICIOUS, PUSA MAJESTY, PUSA GIANT, PUSA NANHA); pomegranate (GANESH, JYOTHI); ber (UMRAN, GOLA, KAITHLI); aonla (CHAKAIYA, KRISHNA, KANCHAN, NA 6, NA 7) and in bael (NA 5, NA 9). In citrus, in vitro shoot+ip grafting along with indexing has been standardized to enable introduction and evaluation of superior germplasm. The technique will also be helpful in raising of virus-free mother plants as a source of bud-wood. For improving the health of fruit plantations, disease and pest complex on most of them has been identified. Integrated Pest Management or protective sprays, conscious of pesticide-residue levels, are now a practice with the growers. The postharvest problems are: a limited shelf-life, the task of transporting the produce across extremely varying climate regimes, and the existing lack of facility for ideal storage to enable better price spread to the grower. Research on postharvest has produced some solutions which have been adopted commercially. They are: @ Acrop of NAGPUR MANDARIN may now be handled with negligible losses until itis sold. The technique takes care of the harvest from pre-cooling to increasing its shelf-life. @ In grapes, use of card fibre-board cartons, grape guard, pre-cooling at 2°— 4°C and 94 per cent relative humidity have prolonged the storage life of the fruit. The shipped consignment reaching its European destinations is absolutely healthy. @ The technology for converting grapes into raisin is being used on a commercial scale.
