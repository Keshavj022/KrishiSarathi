Hiranya and H.G. Joshi Acta Psychologica 255 (2025) 104890 4 3.1.1. Training and awareness The participants stressed about the need of comprehensive programs to educate farmers about credit options, loan management and financial planning. They stated that increasing awareness among farmers about the availability and benefits of institutional credit can empower them to make informed decisions and access financial services more effectively. “Simple guidance on filling out loan applications and understanding eligibility criteria is crucial. More training programs would help every farmer access formal credit more easily” (P 9). Another farmer responded that training sessions should be a com­ munity effort. “Training isn't just for individual farmers—it can be a community effort. Local leaders and successful farmers can share their experiences in simple training sessions, creating a support network that helps everyone under­ stand the credit process better and negotiate with banks on better terms” (P 24). 3.1.2.
