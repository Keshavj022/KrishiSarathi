 Given the perishability and changing quality of horticultural Indian Horticulture 82 products, image-based phenotyping offers faster, more accurate, and larger-scale postharvest monitoring. This enables immediate data analysis and faster crop management decisions, making image-based phenotyping vital for precise horticultural cultivation. Phenomics concept Phenomics is defined as the study of the phenome, which refers to all observable traits that a genotype or genome can display as a result of interactions between environmental factors and its developmental plan. The term 'phenome,' introduced by Davis in 1949, is rooted in Greek, where φαίνω means “to bring to light” and τύπος denotes shape or pattern. A phenotype consists of measurable characteristics (phenotypic traits) expressed by a genotype at a particular time, reflecting developmental stages and environmental conditions. These traits include physical (e.g., colour, shape), chemical (e.g., metabolites, pH), and biological (e.g., growth, physiology) attributes. Phenomics, like other 'omics,' explores this extensive range of traits, with High Throughput Phenotyping (HTP) enhancing efficiency through automation and imaging. Phenomics is the study of the phenome, or the full spectrum of possible phenotypes a genotype can exhibit influenced by both environmental factors and developmental programming. Available sensors for high-throughput phenotyping at NDPPC The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in New Delhi has initiated the establishment of phenomics facilities across India. These facilities are located at ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi, ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture in Hyderabad, ICAR-Indian Institute of Horticultural Research in Bengaluru, and the National Institute of Abiotic Stress Management in Baramati, India. Specifically, ICAR-IARI in New Delhi has developed an advanced automated high-throughput plant phenomics facility, NDPPC, funded by the National Agricultural Science Fund (NASF), ICAR, New Delhi. This facility is equipped with four cutting-edge climate-controlled greenhouses designed for cultivating plants under precisely defined environmental conditions. With 1,200 plant carriers embedded with RFID chip tags, the facility employs a moving field conveyor system to randomize plant positioning within the greenhouse, facilitating automated weighing, watering, and imaging across multiple platforms. Furthermore, the facility features five automated weighing and watering stations, enabling precise induction of drought stress and measurement of transpiration and water-use efficiency. It incorporates several non-invasive image-based sensor platforms for assessing various plant traits Visual high-resolution imaging: Utilizing high- resolution cameras positioned both above and alongside plants, reflectance within the visible spectrum (400-700 nm) is captured.
