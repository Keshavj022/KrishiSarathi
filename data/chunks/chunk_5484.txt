 The bed-irrigation method involves proper levelling of the field, after which the water is directed into beds of convenient sizes through small channels. The water is allowed to soak in the first pair of beds and then turned to the next pair; it continuous to flow until all the beds are irrigated.

Trees used for this purpose are palas, canes, sindwar, datepalm etc. Farmers of Barmasa village are following this practice since time immemorial. Keywords: soil erosion, wind, plantation Shri Barooplal Singh Barmasa, Sahra Dumka (Jharkhand) 2323 Checking of soil erosion by growing trees along the fields Growing of trees along the field is a very old traditions in the village. By introducing trees like grewia, kachnar etc and timely intercultural operation lead to soil and moisture conservation. Undulating topography and poor percolation of water due to poor vegetative cover contribute to soil erosion. In this practice, the trees are grown along the field, which reduce the wind velocity and intensity of sunlight, and thus help in reducing moisture evaporation. People of Baldhar village of Kangra district in Himachal Pradesh have been using this practice, for a long time.

Plants like neem (Azadirachta indica), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp) and palas (Butea monosperma) are planted on the bank of the river and pond, which act as barriers to wind.
