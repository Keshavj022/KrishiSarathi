 For getting maximum fruit set and seed yield, one bee colony per acre is beneficial. The isolation distance of 700 m for certified seeds and 1000 m for foundation seed. The change in colour of fruit is used as criteria of maturity index and fruit turns to bright yellow upon ripening. Yield Average yield is 9.50 t/ha at a spacing of 2.0 m × 0.5 m and it can be increased to 12.00 t/ha at a closer spacing of 1.5 m × 0.5 m.

The number of predatory ladybird beetles and polyphagous spiders were also higher in this module. Furthermore, the highest healthy fruit yields were recorded from the integrated pest management module accompanied with maximum highest cost benefit ratio of 1:5. Under AICRP (VC), treatment comprising of mulching, sequential spray of pyriproxyfen (5% EC) + fenpropathrin (15% EC), spiromesifen (22.9% SC), buprofezin (25% SC) and neem oil @ 10 days interval, recorded least average percent disease incidence (24.44%) against control (71.85%). Additionally, the same treatment recorded the highest average yield of 155.41q/ha over control (77.91q/ha). Also, the same treatment showed the highest C:B ratio of 1:1.95. Hence it can be recommended for the management of viral diseases in okra (Kashi Pragati) under Varanasi region.

It is sown during July-August as kharif season crop and as spring (summer) during February-March. It is tolerant to powdery mildew. The yield of cucumber cv. Swarna Sheetal was tested in a demonstration plot at KVK, Sardarkrushinagar Dantiwada Agricultural University, Khedbrahma, Gujarat in kharif season 2022.
