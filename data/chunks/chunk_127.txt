 Swaminathan endorsed it to meet India’s agricultural needs. In 1965, India faced a war crisis with a neighbouring country, coupled with international pressure and restricted sanctions threatening to halt supplies under PL 480. In this challenging situation, India’s strong political leadership rallied the nation with the slogan “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan,” marking the inception of the real Indian Green Revolution. Green revolution Under the guidance of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and Dr. M. S. Swaminathan, the Government of India initiated efforts to develop high yielding varieties, encouraged use of fertilizer, introduced pesticides, promoted mechanization, and enhanced irrigation facilites. A scientist from Punjab, Mr. Athwal, identified a variety named Kalyan, and ICAR combined it with another variety called Sona, which resulted in the high-performing Kalyan-Sona. The Indian government extended subsidies on various facets was crucial for the Green Revolution. The positive outcomes were notable, with crop yields soaring to 131 million metric tonnes in 1978. Within a decade, India transitioned from being an importer to becoming an exporter. Even during the severe drought faced by Maharashtra in 1972, not a single case of starvation-related casualties was reported, showcasing Indian Farming 48 March 2024 Indian Farming 49 March 2024 the revolution’s impact on food security. However, as the saying goes, “every coin has two sides,” the Green Revolution also brought about adverse effects on ecology and human well-being. Impact of the Green Revolution The Green Revolution primarily targeted wheat and rice production in states like Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, bringing about significant changes in crop yields. Farmers in these regions experienced increased yields through the application of more fertilizers. However, the excessive use of fertilizers made the soil alkaline, which resulted in a loss of soil fertility. In the Punjab region, the use of pesticides reached approximately 923 g/ha in 2011, which was 353 g/ha higher than the national average. This extensive use of pesticides had severe implications on the health of the local population. Notably, the region gained notoriety for the 'cancer train' running between Bhatinda and Bikaner, underscoring the adverse health impacts. The Bhopal tragedy in 1984 serves as a poignant example of the direct and negative consequences of the chemical- intensive practices associated with the Green Revolution. The incident underscores the potential hazards and risks posed by the widespread use of such chemicals in agricultural practices. Organic farming In response to the adverse effects of the Green Revolution, a solution known as organic farming has been advocated. This environmentally friendly approach is considered safer than conventional farming.
