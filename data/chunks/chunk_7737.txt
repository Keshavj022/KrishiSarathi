 The field capacity of stubble collector, used to remove the stubbles and weeds from the field prior to the sowing operation, is 0.17 ha/h with 72.0% field efficiency. The field capacity of the seed drill is 0.13 ha/h with 62.4% field efficiency. The bullock drawn fertilizer applicator-cum-ridger is operated for simultaneous application of fertilizer and ridging in two rows which have the actual field capacity of 0.04 ha/h with 61.5% field efficiency. A bullock operated (rotary system) maize dehusker-cum-sheller was developed with an output of 150 kg/h and shelling efficiency of 95%. This package of animal drawn implements was demonstrated to tribal farmers. They used implements and found that the saving in time of sowing is about 15–20% and in labour cost of weeding 25–30% as compared to traditional practice. Multi-crop planter for intercropping: Animal drawn multi-crop planter for inter-crop of selected crops namely soybean and pigeon pea, wheat and mustard, wheat and black gram and linseed and coriander was developed. It was tested for 4 sets of intercropping, viz. soybean and pigeon pea, wheat and mustard, wheat and black gram and linseed and coriander. The row to row spacing is adjustable and can be kept as 200, 300, 400, 450 and 500 mm. The draught requirement and power output to pull the implement is about 410 N and 0.22 kW, respectively. Field capacity of the planter is 0.28 ha/h with field efficiency of 84.7% at an operating speed of 1.89 km/h. The unit cost of the developed planter is about ` 12,500, and its cost of operation is ` 270/ha. The operational energy requirement is 50 MJ/ha. Fish dressing platform: Women workers carry out fish dressing and peeling in sitting postures. They use Bullock drawn implements for production and post-harvest operation of maize Postural support system to reduce load in bending posture The acute lower back disorder occurs due to awkward and continuous bending in manual agricultural activities such as weeding, rice transplanting, uprooting of crops, plucking of fruits, etc. A study was undertaken to observe physiological and postural parameters at different work place heights. The twisting velocity of spinal cord values ranged between 2 degrees/sec and 6 degrees/sec in standing posture and 9 and 36 degrees/ sec and maximum lateral velocity ranged from minimum of 18 degrees/sec (straight) to maximum of 50 degrees/sec at severe bending posture. This increase in heart rate from 88 to 110 beats/min and energy expenditure varied from 1.30 kcal/min to 2.78 kcal/min when working height reduced from 100 cm to 10 cm. A postural support system with plastic belts and plastic mould system was developed, which gives back support as well as transfers some of the load on back to legs of the worker. This reduces the overall discomfort to the operators. MECHANIZATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 90 crates as desk and work in squatting posture, which causes discomfort.
