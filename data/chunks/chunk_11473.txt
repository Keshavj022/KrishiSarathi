 Field pea varieties, Aman, Prakash, Rachna and Aparna should be sown at a seed rate of 60 to 80kg/ha with a spacing of 30cm x 10cm. Chickpea var. JG-14, JG-16 should be taken up at a seed rate of 60- 80kg/ha with spacing 30cm x 10cm. Lentil variety HUL-57 can either be grown in residual moisture (utera cultivation/relay cropping) or with little irrigation after harvest of paddy with a seed rate of 40-50 kg/ha at a spacing of 30cm × 10cm. For acidic soil, liming should be done at sowing time by using Ca CO3 @ 500 kg/ ha in furrows. Apply NPK@ 20:40:20 kg/ha for rabi pulses. Rapeseed-mustard As relay crop- If soil moisture is optimum (when step on the soil, footprints are observable but not much impression is made) and supposed to be dried up at the time of harvesting, the seeds should be sown just before 4-7 days of harvesting rice crop so that it can germinate using the conserved moisture. Sowing seeds and straw mulching: Seeds should be sown directly into the field and planking follows to fall down the stiff stubbles and then rice straw should be scattered very thinly over the entirely field. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 258 Suitable variety of Manipur- Toria var.: M-27, TS-36 and TS-38, Yellow sarson: Ragini, Mustard: NRCHB-101 Seed rate: 12-14kg/ha. Seeds may be mixed with sand (3to3.5 kg seed+ 2 kg sand for 0.25 ha area) and broadcast. Apply fertilizer dose of 88 kg urea+130 kg SSP+ 33 kg MOP. Total quantity of SSP (130kg) + half of MOP (16kg) should be applied at sowing. First half urea (44kg) should be applied when 1-2 true leaves emerged and the remaining 44 kg with remaining 17 kg MOP should be applied at 25-30 days after first application. Rabi maize should be sown from mid-October to ending November with suitable variety such as HQPM-1, HQPM-5, RCM-76 @ 20 kg/ha with spacing 60 cm×20cm. Apply 10 t/ha FYM or Compost 10-15 days prior to sowing, 150-180 kg N, 70-80 kg P2O5, 70-80 kg K2O and 25 kg ZnSO4. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 259 While carrying out the field activities, safe distance of 3-4 ft should be maintained and engaging more number of people on the same day should be avoided. Preparation of nursery raised beds for sowing of seeds of rabi vegetables (cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, chilli, tomato, onion, garlic, radish, carrot, beat root etc.) may be done during Sep- Oct and transplanting should be done 30-45 days after sowing depending upon the crops. Recommended and known varieties of Cabbage (Green Hero, Rare Ball), Cauliflower (White Excel, Sweta, Pusa snowball etc.), broccoli (Green magic, Harumi 88, Puspa etc.), tomato (Arka Rakshak, Arka Samrat), Onion (Arka Lalima, Bhima Shakti, Bhima Kiran, Prema) can be used. Seeds should be procured from reliable sources. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 260 Farmers are advised to grow the leafy vegetables which have high medicinal values.
