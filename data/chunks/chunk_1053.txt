5 t/ha Urea: 52 kg/ha DAP: 33 kg/ha Inter-cultivation Using a tyne-harrow when crop is 30 days old Irrigation/ drainage 2–5 irrigations in summer crop depending upon soil type and climatic conditions; drain out excess rain water to avoid water logging Weed control Isoproturon (0.5 kg ai/ha) (pre-emergent); 2,4-D (0.75 kg ai/ha) (post-emergent 15–20 DAS) Disease control Rogue out downy mildew affected plants, spray mancozeb @2 g/litre if diseases appear at early stage of crop growth Pest control 1. Early sowing in the month of May wherever possible 2. In late sown crop increase the seed rate one and half times 3. Seed treatment with chloropyriphos @2 ml/ litre water for 1 kg seed or imidachloprid @0.7 ml/litre water Harvesting Harvest when the earheads are dry either by cutting the whole plant by sickle or the ears separately Threshing Thresh after drying for a few days with a stone roller or by trampling under the feet of bullocks Inter-cropping Foxtail millet : pigeon pea (5:1), Foxtail millet : ground nut (2:1); Foxtail millet : cotton (5:1) Blast disease is one of the major diseases of foxtail millet. Other diseases are leaf spot, downy mildew, sheath blight and rust. Shoot fly is one of the important pests, which results in dead hearts leading to yield loss. Lodging is another important yield and quality reducing factor depending on the environmental conditions. The field should be kept free from weeds for higher yields. Improved varieties A number of varieties with high yield potential have been released for different states (Table 3). New varieties have a yield potential of 2000–2600 kg/ha. Short duration varieties like SiA 3085 and SiA 3088 (Surya Nandi) are becoming popular in the major cultivated areas. Foxtail- chickpea system has significantly increased the income in Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh. In paddy fallows also, short-duration foxtail millet is becoming popular in Kurnool in view of limited water supply. Table 3.

The area under the crop is declining due to competition from other crops.
