 LC-MS-based method for typing of A1 and A2 milk An LC-MS-based method was developed for measuring the intact mass of  casein variants (A1 and A 2 type) in milk on the basis of 40 Da mass differences. This method studies the patterns and masses of the casein proteins in cow milk. The caseins are extracted from milk with a denaturing 8 M urea protocol, which breaks apart the micelles and solubilizes the proteins. Chromatography of proteins in urea extract separates the various phosphorylated variants of ,  and kappa forms of casein. Other non-casein proteins from the milk are also observed. Peak identification is based on the protein masses in the deconvoluted spectra. SUCCESS STORIES A cooperative venture to large-scale goat farming in Uttar Pradesh Mohd. Mujassim of Muzaffarnagar (Nansurpur) Uttar Pradesh along with friends decided to start a large- scale goat farm. After visiting CIRG, Makhdoom, Uttar Pradesh in December 2015, their motivation level gets higher and found more possibilities in the sector. After proper training at CIRG, they invested about ` 25 lakh in INDIAN GREEN FARMS (goat farm). Pucca shed with all necessary facilities was constructed as per CIRG model. Sirohi, Jamunapari and Barbari goats were purchased in three phases from Kanpur, Ajmer and Nagaur. Upto March 2017, 200 kids were born (80% twins, 5% triplet and 15% single) at farm. Kid mortality (less than 15 days age) was higher in early days but CIRG intervention led to reduce mortality below 5%. Animals are reared under semi- intensive condition with 3 full-time and 2 part-time labours. Preventive measures were adopted at farm. Goat dung is used in agriculture farm. Bakri Id was target market and 50 animals were sold at average price of ` 12,000/goat with range of ` 8, 500-26,000. Body weight of the animals varied from 32 kg to 57 kg. Net benefit per goat was calculated as ` 7,500. Major constraints faced were vaccine availability, local veterinary aid and trained manpower. They are planning for expanding the farm for 200-500 goats during next year and play an active role in secondary goat farming sector. POST-HARVEST MANAGEMENT AND VALUE-ADDITION DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 84 The in-vitro caco-2 cell model established the effectiveness of these complexes to increase the bioavailability of mineral as compared to mineral salt. CPP-Fe complex showed 80.47% uptake significantly higher than inorganic iron salt (48.26%) and inorganic zinc salt showed 61.46% uptake much lower than CPP- Zn complex (89.12%). The CPP-Fe complex significantly increased ferritin synthesis (41.82 ± 0.79 ng of ferritin/mg cell protein) in caco-2 cell as compared to iron salt (13.54 ± 0.32 ng of ferritin/mg cell protein). These samples were also able to increase serum mineral level in rat model during replanishment in CPP mineral fed group as compared to their respective inorganic salts fed group. The antioxidative enzymes viz.
