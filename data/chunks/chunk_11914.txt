 Orientation of the shelterbelts should be more or less perpendicular to the prevailing winds. Plantation across the wind of a 13 m wide tree belt, interspersed with 60 m wide grass belt provided the better impact. Eight years old plantation of three different types in Jodhpur condition showed effectiveness to reduce wind velocity and erosion up to 2 to 5 H distance and there was 50% reduction in wind erosion. Maximum benefits were derived from series of shelterbelts planted parallel to each other at distance of 10-15 times the height of the central row of trees. The Cassia siamea type shelterbelt (plantation of two outer line of Cassia siamea and the central line of Albizzia lebbeck was found to be the most effective. Ideal form of shelterbelt should be pyramidal in shape. Plantations over dunes and shelterbelt plantations along the IGNP canals not only increased the vegetation cover but also stabilized the loose soils. Wind erosion affected area in western People’s participation in the preparation of checkerboard pattern on sand dunes in Bikaner and Churu district Impact of tree plantation: A sand free road side in Jodhpur Controlling sand slip over barren dune slopes using shrubs/grasses in horizontal pattern in Barmer-Bikaner districts Shelterbelts along the IGNP canal Agro-biodiversity, Ecology and Agriculture: Gandhian Thoughts 84 Mahatma Gandhi’s Vision of Agriculture: Achievements of ICAR Rajasthan has declined from 76% (during 2000s) to ~73% (2011-13). Between 2003-05 and 2011-13, area under desertification in Rajasthan has decreased by 99092 ha. Wind erosion affected area has reduced by 1.34 lakh ha. Land use wise, wind erosion affected area on rainfed crop-land has reduced by 100667 ha and irrigated croplands by 21390 ha. Similarly, under shelterbelts, average loss in crop productivity was 17% due to cold wave in comparison to 30% on farms without shelterbelts. There was also a reduced 5-14% pan evaporation values on either side of belts. 3.8. Gum Arabic Inducing Technology In the late 2000, CAZRI has identified a chemical concentration and procedure for the application, which can enhance the gum production without mortality to the trees. The technique developed by the institute has advantage over the traditional method in view that the plant is injured only at one place on tree trunk to inject CAZRI gum inducer and in turn it produces on an average 400-500 g gum Arabic tree-1 season-1.The technique has shown an enhanced production (400-500 g gum arabic tree-1 season-1) where compared to the traditional method (15-25 g gum arabic tree-1 season-1). A 45° slanted hole of 18 mm diameter and about 3 cm deep is made on tree trunk at 1-2 feet above the collar of the tree with the help of hand drill or battery operated drill machine. After that, 4.0 ml of CAZRI gum inducer is injected in the hole with the help of syringe. After injecting the dose of gum inducer, the hole is immediately covered (patched up) by moistened clay.
