For instance, the statements for observed variables, which was used to construct latent variables was adopted from (Taylor and Todd, 1995; Hsu and Chiu, 2004; Mishra et al., 2016; Zeweld et al., 2017; Despotovic et al., 2019). These were further analysed through a preliminary assessment and pilot survey to enhance the coherence of the questions and improve their overall quality. Further, Cronbach alpha (∝) was used to check the reliability, Average factor loading (AFL) and Average vari- ance extracted (AVE) for validity. Cronbach's alpha indicates the degree of internal consistency among multiple statements in elucidating the latent variable. AVE denotes the average amount of variance that can be explained by the latent variable, while AFL indicates the mean of the degree to which multiple statements assessing the latent variable are in alignment. Recommended values for ∝, AFL and AVE are 0.7, 0.6 and 0.5 respectively (Kline, 2023). The values of latent variables were found to be higher than the recommended values during the current study (Table S3), indicating the reliability and validity of the constructed latent variables. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Descriptive statistics Demographic variables: 6% of the farmers are in the age group of 15–25 years, 44% in 26–35 years, 36% in 35–40 years, and 13% are above the age of 50 years (Fig. 3a), indicating that our study sample is dominated by middle-aged farmers from 26 to 40 years of age. 23% of the farmers have not studied at all, 31% have studied up to class 8, 29% up to class 10, and 16% up to class 12 (Fig. 3a). It indicates that most of the farmers have studied only up to class 10. We could not ﬁnd any farmer on the study site who has completed his graduation. 12% of the farmers have less than 10 years of experience in farming, 33% have experience of 10–20 years and 53% have more than 20 years of experience (Fig. 3a). It indicates that the sample size is dominated by farmers with more than 10 years of experience in farming. 59% of the farmers are small farmers i.e., own an area of less than 1 ha, 35% are marginal farmers possessing area from 1 to 2 ha, and 5% are middle farmers with areas ranging from 2 to 5 ha (Fig. 3a), indicating that small and marginal farmers dominate the sample.
