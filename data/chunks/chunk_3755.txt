 Oil Palm is a heavy feeder of nutrients. Balanced and adequate supply of essential nutrients is the prerequisite for obtaining optimum growth and yield. The annual nutrient removal by the oil palm yielding 2.5 tonne of oil per hectare was found to be 162 kg N, 30 kg P, 217 kg K, 38 kg Mg, 36 kg Ca. From the field trials at ICAR-IIOPR, nutrient requirement was estimated as 1200 : 600 : 1200 : 500 : 100 g of N: P2O5: K2O: MgSO4: Borax g / palm/ year with four equal splits (fertilizer to be applied at quarterly interval) from third year onwards. Accordingly, during the first year, 400: 200:400:125: 25 g N: P2O5: K2O: MgSO4: Borax/ palm/ year, and during the second year 800: 400: 800: 250:50 g N: P2O5: K2O: MgSO4: Borax / palm/ year are the nutrient requirements. Calibrated soil and leaf tests help in achieving balanced and precise fertilizer recommendations. It is advised to generate recommendations based on soil and leaf nutrient analysis. In addition, based on the availability of the organic manures, about 50-100 kg farm yard manure or 100 kg green manure can be applied per palm per year to improve the soil quality. Fertigation: For efficient nutrient management, application of fertilizers through pressurized irrigation system (drip irrigation) called fertigation is highly recommended which offers higher nutrient use efficiency. With this technique, 50 % of the fertilizer recommendation can be reduced, thereby reducing the fertilizer cost and environmental pollution associated. The common fertilizers suitable for fertigation are urea, ammonium sulphate, diammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, potassium chloride, potassium sulphate, etc. Use of single super phosphate should be avoided in this system, as it clogs the filters and emitters. In this system, the entire dose is split into 12 equal parts and applied at monthly interval. Under fertigation, the nutrient requirement is estimated as 600:300:600 g of NPK per ha per palm per year and MgSO4 and Borax requirements as 250 and 50 g per palm in a year. This accounts to 5 – 3 – 5 kg of Urea, DAP and MOP respectively, along with 1.2 kg Mg SO4 and 240 g of Borax per acre per month. In case of soil application, these requirements are just double of these values. However, soil and leaf analysis based nutrient application ensures optimal levels of nutrient uptake and maintenance of soil reserves at optimal levels. The commonly prevalent nutritional deficiencies or disorders in Indian Oil Palm plantations are potassium (K) deficiency, magnesium (Mg) deficiency, boron (B) deficiency, and nitrogen (N)/ K imbalance. Other nutrient deficiencies were not yet been reported under Indian conditions. Soil and water conservation: In hilly terrains, mulching, formation of half-moon terraces, bench terraces, contour bunding and planting on the contour line, use of drip irrigation system, cover cropping and construction of water storage tank for irrigation could be followed for soil and water management.
