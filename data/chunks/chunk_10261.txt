 20 crores. Achievements in Horticulture in Independent India 121 Fruits of Mallika variety of mango. In 1971, a hybrid Mallika (Neelam x Dushehari) was released. It is is semi-vigorous and hence can be planted at 6-8 m spacing. The fruits of Mallika are big (300 g) and have good pulp content 72%. Fruits are sweet (TSS 240Brix), fibreless firm pulp with appealing flavour and good shelf-life (6-8 days). Mallika is semi-vigorous and hence can be planted at 6-8 m spacing. At present its area in the country is over 45,000 ha with maximum area in Karnataka (20,000 ha) followed by West Bengal (8,000 ha), Gujarat (5000 ha), etc. Karnataka is exporting fresh Mallika mangoes to the USA, parts of the European Union, UAE, Kuwait, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea, while Gujarat is exporting it to EU countries along with Kesar. 3.1.2 Dogridge rootstock of grape The grape rootstock Dogridge (Vitis champinii) was developed to overcome the adverse effects of drought and salinity, but also to improve the yield and quality of major commercial scion varieties. In addition, the raisin recovery from the grapes harvested from the vines grown on Dogridge rootstock is higher to the tune of 25% compared to own rooted vines. Yield gain was in the range of 5-10%, while reduction in cultivation costs was in the range of 10-15% across major grape growing regions of Maharashtra and Karnataka. There were other intangible benefits such as improved quality of the berries and reduction in the total water requirement for the crop. Today, more than 90% of the area under grape cultivation in India is on Dogridge rootstock. Employing this rootstock, training to Y trellis, developing sub-canes and proper scheduling of growth regulators have increased BC ratio both in domestic and export grapes to the extent of 2.3:1 and 5.26:1, respectively. Employing Dogridge rootstock, training to Y trellises, developing sub canes and proper scheduling of growth regulators has increased the productivity from 10-11 t ha-1 during 1990-91 to 22 t ha-1 during 2018-19. The total value of grape crop raised under this technology currently is Rs 9,456.0 crores. Exports of fresh grapes earned a foreign exchange of US$ 334.91 million (Rs. 2,335 crores) while exports of raisins earned US$ 26.217 million during 2018. Nearly 90% of these exports are based on the fruits obtained from grapes cultivated on Dogridge rootstock. Indian Agriculture after Independence 122 Grape crop raised on Dogridge rootstock, training to Y trellis, developing sub canes and timely scheduling of growth regulators 3.1.3. Improved varieties and crop regulation technology of pomegranate MPKV, Rahuri has developed Bhagawa and Super-Bhagwa, which were tested under AICRP Arid zone fruits and found to be superior over existing varieties like Ganesh and Arakta both in terms of yield and fruit quality. It has recorded in case of Bhagawa that a higher fruit weight (320.
