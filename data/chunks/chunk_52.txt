 Rice growing farmers were given five-day trainings in collaboration with the state department of agriculture. The campaigns also included detailed information about schemes and incentives to farmers on crop residue management machinery and custom hiring centres. In Haryana and Delhi, students of 416 schools and 102 colleges were mobilized through essay competitions, paintings, debates, etc. and about 39,580 students were informed about benefits of in situ crop residue management. Total 103 farmers’ fairs were organised in Haryana and Delhi with the participation of 65,511 farmers from nearby villages. Live demonstrations of machineries used for crop residue management after harvesting of rice were made in these farmers’ fairs. SUMMARY Use of in situ crop residue management machines could turn ‘so called’ waste or residue into a much ‘productive’ asset contributing towards 3.23 kg/day in the productivity and `104.3 /day in net return. Beyond the food security and economic indicators, the in-situ residue management also contributes towards soil sustainability and is an environment friendly activity. The frontline extension institutes in target states of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi NCR and Uttar Pradesh proactively undertook these machines to farmers’ fields for their popularization and infuse ‘pull’ effect for creating demand of these machineries. The State Governments should incentivised both individuals and community approach for upscaling machineries. The community frontline extension approach with active participation of public leadership, social and civil society organizations, children, students, teachers and spiritual leaders helped in better mobilization of society and all stakeholders responsible for an ‘inclusive’ ecosystem for the success of any movement of this nature. *Corresponding author email: hariagro@gmail.com 45.00 46.00 47.00 48.00 49.00 50.00 51.00 52.00 Happy seeder Super seeder Zero till seed drill Check 51.74 50.91 50.89 47.86 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000 80000 Happy seeder Super seeder Zero till seed drill Check 75358 72936 75749 62847 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 Happy seeder Super seeder Zero till seed drill Check 3.17 2.99 3.39 2.66 Fig. 1.
