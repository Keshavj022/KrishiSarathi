 CoPb 95 has better performance as compared to the other generally prevailing cultivars. Comparing the above facts, CoPb 95 was already released in the state of Punjab for improving the livelihoods of cane growers of Punjab in the year 2021. In a short period, farmers frequently are demanding for its seed due to its better performance and resistance to insect pests and disease attacks. Economics The average cane yield of the Punjab state is 82.2 t/ha. While the average cane yield of this variety is more than 100 t/ha, if this variety is Table 2.

Success story The early adopters of this variety have many success stories with respect to its production and planting experience. A progressive farmer from command area of Cooperative Sugar Mill, district Fazilka, Mr. Dhiraj Kumar planted CoPb 95 with few canes in his farm. Due to performance of this variety in his field, he has planted 20 acres under this variety. According to him, this variety does not lodge and has marked it as an excellent variety for sugarcane growers. Another farmer from command area of Cooperative Sugar Mill, district Nakodar, Jalandhar, Sardar Lakmir Singh planted CoPb 95 on more than 10 acre and got cane yield of more 600 q/acre. Similarly, Sardar Baldev Singh from command area of Cooperative Sugar Mill, district Ajnala, Amritsar is successfully cultivating CoPb 95 and considers this variety a boon for the farmers. adopted the average cane yield of state will increase. As per current cane price in Punjab (`380/q), the gross income from per hectare of sugarcane is `3,12,360. If farmers will adopt CoPb 95, their gross income will be `4,03,750/ha. This will help in increasing the farm income of sugarcane growers of the state. SUMMARY To summarize, CoPb 95 is a high- yielding, early-maturing cultivar suitable for sugar mills of Punjab. The short running span of state sugar mills has created a huge demand among sugarcane growers for early variety. The previously released sugarcane varieties in early group in state ranged from 75–84 t/ha for average cane yield where CoPb 95 has significant edge for cane yield (106 t/ha). In the current situation, where the popular variety Co 238 has become prone to red rot in the state and needs to be replaced, CoPb 95 is a good alternative for sugarcane growers in the state of Punjab. Farmers prefer its seed due to its early maturing, high yield, and high quality coupled with lesser attacks by insect pests and diseases. The average cane yield of the Punjab state was 82.2 t/ha in 2021–22 and this variety has potential to increase the average cane yield of state.
