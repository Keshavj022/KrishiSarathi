  Broodstock can be developed by stocking wild caught fishes of 500 g-1 kg in a 10 tonne Recirculation Aquaculture System (RAS) @ 1kg/m3 and rearing for a period of 4-5 months.  Brood fishes are fed ad libitum with fishes like sardine, mackerel or anchovies, and squid supplemented with vitamins and minerals. They also have to be fed intermittently with compounded semi-moist feed at the rate of 2% of body weight to improve quality of egg produced.  The fish is a protogynous hermaphrodite and sexes cannot be easily recognized by external appearance. Spawning occurs without any hormonal injection in re-circulatory aquaculture system (RAS).  Spawning takes place in early morning. Fertilized eggs are of dia 700-740 µ, and are transparent, pelagic and non-adhesive in nature. The newly hatched larva measures 1.35- 1.54 mm.  Mouth opens on 3rd day of post-hatch and the larval rearing is done in green-water medium (Nanochloropsis salina, Isochrysis galbana, Chaetoceros calcitrans in the ratio of 3:1:1). Nauplii of copepod species like Acartia sp. and Pseudodiaptomus serricaudatus are used as first food. From day 5th to 16th, rotifers at density of 4-6 nos/ml are provided as food.  Artemia can be given from 15thdph onwards and weaned on pellet feed from 20 dph (200- 400 µ). Larvae become benthic from 25-30 dph onwards.  Juveniles attain the size 27-28 mm and 0.26-0.28 g in 45-50 dph.  The technology is being extended in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala.

It is cultured all over the world due to its compatibility in polyculture system.  Breeding in captivity is attained through artificial inducement, for which brooders of 2+ year- class are raised in earthen ponds at biomass of 1500-2000 kg/ha.  Sexes are distinct during spawning season with females having bulged abdomen and fleshy genital pore with soft pectoral fins. Males are slender, having rough pectoral fins and ooze milky-white milt from vent on pressing the belly.  Captive spawning is undertaken either in hapa or in circular hatchery. In both cases, a sex ratio of 1:1 is maintained. Brooders are induced by injecting either pituitary extract or commercially available synthetic Gonadotropin hormones (CH).  Pituitary extract to females is administered in two doses; 1st dose of 2-3 mg/kg and 2nd dose of 6-8 mg/kg body weight at an interval of 6-8 h, whereas males are given a single dose of 2-3 mg/kg at the time of 2nd dose to females. However, in case of CH, a single dose of 0.5-0.6 ml/kg to female and 0.2-0.3 ml/kg to male is given.  Stripping is done when kept in hapa, but breeds naturally in spawning tanks of circular hatchery. Fecundity of this species is around 1.5 lakh/kg body weight of female.
