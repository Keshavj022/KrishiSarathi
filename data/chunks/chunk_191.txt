 Employing a specially formulated dust feed with 40% protein and 10% fat at both dawn and dusk proves to be an effective strategy. Feeding in close proximity to dip nets plays a crucial role in conditioning the fry, encouraging them to gather near the nets. This conditioning significantly enhances the efficiency of harvesting, ensuring a seamless harvesting whenever required. Parental care The brood fishes create small pits in the pond bottom to provide a secure space for the tiny hatchlings, shielding them from potential predators. These brood fishes exhibit parental care by relocating the seeds from one pit to another at different intervals, demonstrating a protective behaviour. This involves keeping the fry in small pits near the egg colonies on the pond bottom for 4 to 5 days. The early separation of pearlspot fry from their parents facilitates subsequent spawning at an earlier stage.The school of fish fries adopts a spherical shape while moving during the first month after hatching, possibly as a natural defensive mechanism to deter predatory fishes. The transition from the fry stage to reaching a marketable size seed can take approximately 2 months. Predator control The presence of predatory weed fishes, such as Etroplus maculatus, frequently diminishes the seed survival percentage. Despite attempts to eradicate these weed fishes during pond preparation, certain eggs or larvae persist, grow in the ponds, and subsequently function as predators. In the event of a surge in the population of weed fishes within the breeding ponds, their elimination may need to be carried out twice a year by resetting the pond and repeating all the pond preparation procedures. As birds prey on fish larvae and fry on a massive scale in breeding ponds, the top surface of the ponds needs to be covered with 1.25 mm thick Indian Farming 12 March 2024 Indian Farming 73 March 2024 and 60 mm mesh high-density polyethylene (HDPE) nets. Similarly, the pond-side walls are covered with 2.5 mm wide and 30 mm mesh HDPE nets to prevent ottersâ€™ entry. Pest control and water quality The existence of the ectoparasite Caligus minimus poses a substantial threat to pearlspot seed production. To mitigate this risk, it is crucial to uphold optimal water quality. Additionally, careful broodstock selection is essential to ensure that the brood fish introduced to the ponds are free from external parasites. Achieving this involves stocking the brood fish in separate tanks or ponds for quarantine, typically for about a week, to meticulously confirm the absence of external parasites. This quarantine process stands as the most effective measure to prevent the entry of external parasites into the ponds. A precautionary approach to water quality management is essential for preventing and controlling infestations in breeding ponds.
