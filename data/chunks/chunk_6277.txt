 The land management and uprooting of unwanted vegetation by the farmer for establishing orchard reduced the species diversity. This indigenous technology of intervention of the horticulture crops in the area and maintaining the indigenous species on the same piece of land, the farmer developed a sustainable land-management system in terms of ecological bio- diversity, soil health, less soil erosion and economical improvement. Conclusion Contour orchard farming and terracing are the pre-requisites of the steep-slope orchard raising, as has been tried by the discloser. To mitigate the water stress and soil-erosion condition due to steep slopes, management of the slopes through vegetative structures was found essential. This intervention helped in developing the ecological and economically sustainable land-management system. 9 Traditional Knowledge in Agriculture 4. PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT 4.1 Management of yellow stem-borer in paddy by use of parasi (Cleistanthus collinus) leaf Description of the ITK Application of 75-150 kg parasi (Cleistanthus collinus) leaves by broadcasting once in the rice field at 3 days after transplanting controls yellow stem- borer during kharif. All the rice growers in Aralkocha village of Purulia district in West Bengal follow this practice for the last 50 years.

Results and discussion Experiments were conducted during rainy season (kharif) of 2002, 2003 and 2004 and during winter season (rabi) 2004. The treatments taken during the experiment of CRRI farm were: (i) use of parasi (75 kg/ha) at 30 days after transplanting (DAT), (ii) use of parasi (75 kg/ha) each at 30, 60 and 90 DAT, (iii) use of parasi (100 kg/ha) at 30 DAT, (iv) use of parasi (100 kg/ ha) each at 30, 60 and 90 DAT, (v) use of parasi (150 kg/ha) at 30 DAT, (vi) use of parasi (150 kg/ ha) each at 30, 60 and 90 DAT, (vii) use of carbofuran (1 kg/ha) at 60 and 90 DAT, and (viii) untreated control and seedlings of Savitri variety at 30 days were transplanted during third week of July. In both the years 2002 and 2003, the insect population were decreased in farmersâ€™ field. Reduction in population was related to the drought and heavy rain situation by the farmers. Yield varied from 5.63 to 6.03 tonnes/ha in comparison to 4.93 tonnes/ha in untreated control.
