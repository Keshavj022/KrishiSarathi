 As a result of chances to either lessen the negative effects of surplus water on agricultural productivity or to irrigate crops in semi-arid and desert regions for both irrigated and dry land areas, PRBs have historically been linked to water management challenges. The maize-wheat systems’ sustainability can be improved, and cultivation expenses decreased by using the PRB technique. Permanent raised bed cropping systems can be used to increase productivity while also saving water during field application. As excess water can be discharged more effectively than with basin/flood irrigation, furrow bed systems have also significantly reduced the risk of water logging. Raised bed planting has several benefits over traditional flat surface watering, including 30% average increase in grain yield, 73% increase in water use efficiency, 25% saving in applied irrigation water and 30- 50% saving in the quantity of seed used for seeding. Raised-bed planting efficiently collects water and distributes it where it is most needed, as opposed to farmers’ usual practice of spreading water over the entire surface area. Raised-bed planting also resulted in labour and energy savings. One hectare (ha) of wheat planted in a raised bed required an average of 29.4 hours of water pumping, whereas a flat field required 43.9 hours. Farmers’ Table 1.

Raised-Sunken beds: With around 72% of the total farmed area, rainfed rice is the main food crop in India’s north-eastern region. However, the later growth stage of the rice crop frequently experiences soil moisture stress. Due to extreme moisture stress, farmers cannot harvest any crops during the winter (rabi) season. As a result, for the cultivation of rabi crops to be successful, suitable land arrangement is essential. In this context, a raised and sunken bed (RSB) system is a basic land structure that can be used to boost agricultural productivity in the paddies of India’s north-eastern area through inter-plot water harvesting. To maximize water collection, RSBs are built to hold water until the soil can absorb it.
