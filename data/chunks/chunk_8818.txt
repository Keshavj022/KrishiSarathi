 Crop Protection Linseed intercropped with chickpea (3:1) at recommended fertilizer (N 60-80, P 40 kg/ha) and irrigation (two to three), bird perches at 40-50 pegs/ha and a single application of Imidacloprid 200 SL at 100 ml/ha at ET level of 10% bud-fly infestation has been found the best module against bud-fly. SESAME Crop Improvement JTS 8 has been released and notified for cultivation in the arid and semi-arid ecosystems of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Over 3 tonnes of breeder seed of 24 varieties was produced against the DAC indent of 0.65 tonnes. Crop Production Single superphosphate or elemental sulphur or gypsum significantly increased sesame yield. Sesame + urdbean (3:3) intercropping at Vridhachalam, sesame - clusterbean (4:1) at Tikamgarh, sesame + cotton (3:1) at Amreli, sesame + urdbean (2:2) at Powerkheda have been found the most remunerative systems. Crop Protection SI 250 and IC 204137 lines have been found tolerant to Antigastra, and IC 205071 has been identified as promising with resistance to Antigastra and Dasyneura. Two sprays of Endosulfan (0.07%) at 30 and 45 DAS proved most effective, followed by neemgold, neem oil and neem formulation for controlling leaf roller/capsule- borer and bud-fly. Advance breeding materials i.e. RT 46, RT 54, RT 103, RT 125 and VRI 1 have been found resistant to phyllody and moderately resistant to Macrophomina stem/ root-rot. RT 325 and PKDS 5 have showed moderate resistance against Macrophomina stem/root-rot and phyllody.

DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 32 NIGER A high-yielding, early-maturing Gujarat Niger 1 has been identified for cultivation in south western tribal areas of Gujarat. JNC 6 a composite of 7 genetically diverse strains with wide adaptability and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses has been identified for release at the national level. Over 0.7 tonne of breeder seed of 4 varieties was produced against the DAC indent of 0.36 tonne.
