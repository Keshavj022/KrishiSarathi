 Integrated farming system approach Rising production costs threaten the livelihoods of marginal and small farmers. Adopting scientifically designed IFS models can help stabilize and enhance income while promoting natural resource management and diversification. Although Indian farmers have long practiced IFS, there is an urgent need to popularize scientifically informed models for profitability and sustainability. A scientific IFS model, integrating crops, backyard gardens, poultry, livestock, and mushroom production, offers multiple income streams and promotes sustainable resource management. Successful implementation requires access to quality inputs and markets, as well as training to improve decision-making and optimize resources, ultimately enhancing income and livelihood security. Technological assemblage through crop-based interventions Intercropping mustard with sugarcane during the rabi season was adopted by 35 farmers, generating an average of 22.19 quintals/ha of mustard with the improved variety RH 725, yielding 22.2% more and a net income of `90,453/ha. Eighteen farmers adopted the improved black gram variety 'PU 30' as an intercrop in sugarcane, generating a net income of `42,799/ha with a cultivation cost of `11,263/ha. Similarly, nine farmers adopted the green gram variety Virat as an intercrop, achieving a yield of 6.59 q/ha and a net income of `34,752/ha. In the sole sugarcane crop, Integrated Plant Nutrient Management (IPNM) and Integrated Weed Management (IWM) practices were implemented by 73 farmers, resulting in a yield of 899.08 q/ha, 10.8% higher than previous practices. Farmers earned an average gross return of `292,199/ha and a net return of `221,931/ha. Additionally, high-yielding varieties DBW-187, DBW-222, and DBW-173, developed by ICAR-IIWBR, Karnal, were distributed to 69 farmers. These varieties achieved yields of 57.03 q/ha, 11.4% higher than previous practices. With a cultivation cost of `28,573.97/ha, farmers generated a gross income of Indian Farming 74 (10): 46-48; October 2024 Indian Farming 47 October 2024 `112,479/ha and a net income of `83,905/ha. Technological assemblage through horticulture based interventions One of the critical interventions for improving productivity in farmers’ fields is ensuring the availability of high-quality planting material. Supplying certified, disease-free, and genetically superior seeds or saplings to farmers is a foundational step in boosting crop yields and overall farm income. Quality planting materials ensure better germination rates, enhanced resistance to pests and diseases, and improved crop performance in terms of both the quantity and quality of produce. Multitier horticulture-based interventions, such as (Strawberry + Capsicum + Bitter gourd/Bottle gourd), were implemented in selected farmers’ fields, leading to a 136% increase in net income.
