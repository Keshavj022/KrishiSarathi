 The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Con- vention to Combat Desertification (CCD) both aim to re- duce poverty and enhance the management of carbon in drylands (FAO, 2004). Significant funding from develop- ment agencies or C investors will be required in areas where farmers do not receive direct support in order to realize soil C sequestration initiatives in dryland farming systems (Neely et al., 2009). To understand the concept of carbon sequestration, Figure 1 presents a simplified dia- gram of the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems. Fig. 1. Terrestrial global carbon balance (IPCC, 2000; https:// www.fao.org/4/y5738e/y5738e05) The main entry of C into the biosphere is through the process of photosynthesis or gross primary productivity (GPP), that is the uptake of C from the atmosphere by plants. Part of this C is lost in several processes: through plant respiration (autotrophic respiration); as a result of litter and soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition (het- erotrophic respiration) and as a consequence of further losses caused by fires, drought, human activities, etc. The increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration stimulates the process of photosynthesis (currently substrate-limited) and consequently plant growth, as extensive experimental re- search has shown (IPCC, 2000). The extent of this stimu- lation varies according to different estimates, being larger for forest (up to 60%) and smaller for pastures and crops (about 14%). Current scientific evidence suggests that managed and mature old growth forests act as active car- bon sinks sequestering C at rates of up to 6 tonnes/ ha/year (for boreal and temperate forests) (Valentini et al., 2000). The primary challenge in dryland farming is limited water availability.
