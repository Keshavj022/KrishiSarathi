 The G20 countries can identify some of the themes of local and scientific practices, which we have discussed earlier, with the aim of meeting challenges of sustainable agriculture, and be supported to strengthen research and development through funding mechanisms, and investment initiatives. Such collaboration and initiatives by the G20 countries on sustainable agriculture may Table 1. Major sustainable agricultural practices Sustainable agricultural practice Brief description Crop rotation Maintaining soil fertility, insect pressure, and biodiversity through rotating crops Intercropping Multi-cropping to improve nutrient utilisation, insect control, and productivity Agroforestry Trees and shrubs in agriculture and livestock systems increase soil health, preserve water, and sequester carbon Organic farming Using natural pest management, soil health, and avoiding synthetic pesticides and fertilizers Conservation agriculture Conserving soil and water by minimising soil disturbance, conserving soil cover and rotating crops Integrated pest management (IPM) Biological, cultural, and chemical pest management for economic and environmental sustainability Cover crops Planting fallow crops that cover the ground, promote soil health, inhibit weeds, and prevent erosion Precision agriculture Optimizing water and fertiliser use with technology to reduce waste and environmental effect No-till/reduced-tillage farming Reducing or eliminating tillage to limit soil disturbance, retain moisture, and reduce erosion Sustainable livestock management Promoting animal care, effective resource utilisation, and minimised environmental impact Rainwater harvesting and water management Rainwater collection, effective irrigation, and water resource management to reduce waste On-farm biodiversity conservation Diversifying farm crops, animals, and natural habitats to boost ecosystem resilience and productivity Integrated nutrient management system Optimizing organic and inorganic fertiliser sources to improve agricultural yield, soil fertility, and pollution Integrated farming system Combining crops, livestock, and agroforestry to produce a robust, sustainable production system Renewable energy Uses solar and wind energy to power farms and reduce greenhouse gas emissions Drip irrigation Directly waters plant roots, saving water and improving efficiency Indian Farming 47 June 2023 further be aligned with the FAO, World Bank, and IFAD activities and programmes. With these initiatives, the G20 countries can use their knowledge, resources, and networks of institutions to help member countries with capacity building, research, and technical assistance on sustainable agriculture. Raising awareness on diverse knowledge systems and technologies on sustainable agriculture and making required investment in it alongwith continued advocacy may generate sufficient resource-base to prioritize and encourage the sustainable agriculture.
