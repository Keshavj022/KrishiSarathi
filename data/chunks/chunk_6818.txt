in) Goat Human erythropoietin (hepo) expressed in goat somatic cells by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knocking- in of HEPO gene: Mammary epithelial cells derived from goat mammary glands under in vitro conditions are an attractive alternative for the production of secretory recombinant hEPO protein. CRISPR/ Cas9 mediated genome editing was carried out to express human erythropoietin in goat somatic cells. Goat mammary epithelial cells were genetically modified for the production of recombinant hEPO in a conditioned medium. Equine Glanders surveillance: ICAR-NRCE, Hisar is actively involved in glanders surveillance, providing diagnostic support, capacity building of state diagnostic laboratories/ RDDLs. For rapid and efficient execution of surveillance activities, Hcp1 ELISA kit developed by NRCE is being used for glanders diagnosis. A total of 16,431 equine sera received from 19 states under glanders surveillance programme were tested. Out of these, 106 glanders positive cases were recorded from 12 states. Surveillance and monitoring of equine infectious diseases: A total of 1,737 equine serum samples from 8 Three-dimensional structures of DSP-1 (A), HSP-1 (B) and PDC-109 (C) generated by I-TASSER server Pig African swine fever (ASF): Total 456 out of 861 porcine samples received from 14 states [Bihar (88 out of 107), Sikkim (28 out of 65), Uttar Pradesh (31 out of 60), Uttarakhand (77 out of 163), Delhi (12 out of 14), CRISPR/CAS9 mediated knock-in of human erythropoietin gene in the goat fibroblast cells. The transgenic goat fetal fibroblast cells expressing hEPO gene fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene Livestock Management icar annual report 2022-23 115 Kerala (9 out of 29), Mizoram (24 out of 24), Karnataka (11 out of 15), Punjab (46 out of 144), Jharkhand (16 out of 36), Madhya Pradesh (49 out of 90), Haryana (59 out of 93), Goa (6 out of 18) and Odissa (0 out of 3)] were found to be positive for ASF by real time PCR. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS): Five out of 216 porcine samples received from Sikkim (5 out of 167) and Madhya Pradesh (0 out of 49) were positive for PRRSV genome by RT-PCR. Sero-prevalence and molecular epidemiology of important porcine viral diseases in pigs in NER: Total 211 serum samples were screened against CSFV, ASFV, PCV-2, PRRS and JEV from Assam, Meghalaya and Manipur. Sample positive for JEV (61) in serum and PCV-2 positive in 12 samples. Total 79 samples (48 tissue and 31 blood samples) were analysed and 4 were positive for PCV2, 2 for PRRS, 2 for CSVF and 2 for ASFV.
