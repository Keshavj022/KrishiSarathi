 The net profit of Rs 17,670/ha could be achieved by using zero-till drill as against of Rs 7,436/ha with 3 operations of tillage (two cultivator + one patela) and of Rs 2,066/ha by broadcasting in the well- prepared field. Light-weight Power-weeder for Interculture The light-weight power-weeder has been found suitable for weeding with 40- cm rotavator and rotary wheel. The interculture was conducted in 9 hectares of sugarcane, 4.5 hectares of maize and 2 hectares of tobacco. Field capacity and field efficiency of the weeder for the crops were 0.2 ha/hr, 0.11 ha/hr and 0.2 ha/hr and 90%, 77.5% and 95%, respectively. And there was a net saving of Rs 1,070/ha with the use of the weeder compared to traditional method of interculture. Self-propelled Vertical Conveyor-reaper Evaluated the reaper at the AADU,Allahabad centre, for rice Pant 10 and wheat PBW 245 and UP 262, covering 42.85 ha and 18.5 ha. Machine capacity was 0.19 ha/hr and its efficiency was 59%for rice. For wheat PBW 245 and UP 262, machine capacity ranged between 0.16 and 0.22 ha/hr and its efficiency between 63 and 68%. Manual harvesting required 144 man-hr/ha and another 84 man-hr/ha were required for crop collection and bundling. Thus, harvesting manually costed Rs 1,900/ha against Rs 1,442 (including crop collection and bundling) per hectare by the reaper. There was the saving in the cost of harvesting by reaper of 24% and in labour requirement by 60.5%. POST-HARVEST ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY Pre-milling treatment and recovery of dal Whole pigeonpea grains (Asha variety) were treated with 4% soil, followed by 4% CIRCOT enzyme. The pitted and cleaned samples were soaked in water for 75 min and later dried up to 10% moisture. The samples were milled for 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 seconds. The results showed enhanced recovery of dal due to applied enzyme. The dal yield was 80.56 to 84.04% with 6.02â€“7.24% broken material. Post-harvest Losses Reduction in Strawberry GA3, NAA, 2,4-D, TIBA, CaCl2 and Ca (NO3) 2 were sprayed at 4 and 2 weeks before harvesting strawberry. Calcium nitrate (1%) reduced PLW, GA3 (25 ppm) favoured TSS retention during storage; 2,4-D (40 ppm) arrested acidity; NAA (75 ppm and 25 ppm) preserved more sugar and vitamin C contents respectively during storage. Calcium chloride, ascorbic acid and calcium nitrate were used after harvest. Ascorbic acid at 0.2% and at 0.05% was found better for minimum PLW and higher vitamin C retention. Calcium chloride at (0.1%) was effective in arresting acidity Light weight power-weeder for interculture. It is found suitable for weeding with 40-cm rotavator and rotary wheel. There is a net saving of Rs 1,070/ha with this, compared to traditional method of interculture ANTI-NUTRITIONAL FACTORS MINIMIZED FROM SOYBEAN Soak soybean seeds inoculated artificially with Rhizopus oligosporous and Aspergillus oryzae, followed by blanching them for 10 and 40 minutes. This results in 68% reduction in phytic acid.
