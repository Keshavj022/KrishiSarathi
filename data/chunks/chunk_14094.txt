 wi = ∑k j=1FjAij ∑k j=1 ∑n i=1Fj (9) where wi indicates the weightage of the variable for WQI calculation, F represents the factor 1 auto value, the Aij indicates the capability of variables i through factor j, i denotes the total amount of chemical variables nominated in the model (1to n), and j indicates the number of factors designated in the method (1 to k) (Eq. (9). The IWQI was eval­ uated, using Eq. (10) IWQI = ∑ k j=1 qi × wi (10) 2.5. Spatial Investigation In the study area, the Irrigation water quality index (IWQI) was spatially depicted using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpo­ lation method of ArcGIS version v10.7.0.10450′s. This method is a very efficient interpolation technique that determines the weighted average of concentration by calculating the average concentration value of point properties around a particular point. All point features in the research region repeats this procedure. IWQI, %Na, PI, RSC, SAR, KR, and MHR across the region were created by the IDW approach. This technique has already been undertaken by (Duraisamy et al., 2019; Isa et al., 2024; Karunanidhi et al., 2021a; Kushe et al., 2024; Mukherjee and Singh, 2020; Patnaik et al., 2024; Selmane et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2020). 2.6. Application of machine learning-based prediction models In this research study two ML based models, SVM Model and KNN model are used to predict irrigation water quality based on IWQI index values. 2.6.1. Support vector Machine (SVM)Model The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was initially created by Vapnik (2013) based on the structural risk reduction principle of sta­ tistical learning theory and the Vapnik −Chervonenkis (VC) dimension theory (Bisht et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2016). SVM is one of the supervised ML techniques, using for both classification and regression analysis (Hassan et al., 2021). The main purpose of the SVM model is to identify the hyperplane, which allows the dataset to be classified into different groups based on the group that produces the highest margin. In the rare circumstances, it is difficult to divide the dataset linearly. The dataset is first transformed into a higher- dimensional space with help of Kernel functions using SVM, after which it is separated into linear segments. Support vectors are defined as input points on the hyperplane. After finding a hyperplane that divides the data into this high-dimensional space, it allows the SVM results to be mapped back to the original space (Vapnik. (2013); Azamathulla et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2020; Ekanayake et al., 2021; Sarafaraz et al., 2024). The following equation (Eq.11) represents the observation dataset. Ds = {(xi, yi) }n i=1 (11) where xi indicates the inputs values and yi denotes the resulted values with a linear kernel function. S indicates modelling system and Ds observation dataset.
