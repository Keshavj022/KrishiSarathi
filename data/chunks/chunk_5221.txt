 Though the occasional use of molasses was reported, it was mentioned that its use for distillation was highly avoidable. 15. For cost of liquor extraction (per unit) as the raw material is home produced, there is no cost of production except on equipment which is a one-time investment and may require occasional repair. 16. The reasons, gender wise, for extraction of liquor are: (a) It prevents wastage of fruit etc = 40% M 89%W b. Dietary requirement = 100% M 100% W c. Medicinal purpose = 100% M 100% W d. To serve to guests = 100% M 100% W e. For prayer service = 100% M 100% W f. Weddings/ceremonies = 100% M 100% W g. Sale = 0% M 0% W Predominant raw materials used as per location are given in Table 1. Best extract was obtained from i. Grape distillate is called angoori and is considered the best. It is used even for medicinal purposes. ii. Apple is by far the most used fruit, since B-grade apple is available in plenty and it is the principal cash crop. iii. Bemi has more sugar as compared to chulli, which is relatively more sour. iv. Mixed fruit yields more distillate, as the sweet and sour fruits stimulate one another during fermentation.

For chemical analysis of distilled liquor, 7 samples were extracted. Out of these, 3 samples (sample nos 5, 6 and 7) were from pure fruit, i.e. apple + chulli + bemi, and the remaining 4 were fruit + molasses (gur). Sample 4 was extracted from grapes + molasses. Samples 1, 2 and 3 were extracted from apple + pear + bemi + molasses. The following chemical tests were carried out. i. Alcohol strength: to reveal the percentage of alcohol in the sample. ii. Methyl alcohol: to reveal the presence or absence of poison in the sample. iii. Total acidity: to reveal acidic content.  ETHNIC FOOD Table 2.

Volatile acidity: to reveal acidity. v. Esters: to reveal number of quantity of flavours (aromas). vi. Colouring matter: to reveal the presence or absence of added materials. These samples were tested out in Government Food Testing Laboratory located at Kandaghat in Solan district of Himachal Pradesh. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results on the various physico-chemical characteristics of the distilled alcoholic beverages are presented in Table 3. The salient observations are the following: 1. Wide fluctuation is observed in the alcohol content amongst the various distillates. The first bottle had higher alcohol concentration than the middle or the last bottle.
