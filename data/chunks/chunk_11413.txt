 Potato can be grown on different types of soils with well drained, loose, friable, non-saline and non- alkaline loamy sand to sandy loam soils are suitable for this crop. Soil pH should be in the range of 5.5 - 8.0. Early Varieties are Kufri Surya (Heat tolerant, white tuber, resistance to late blight, good keeping quality, early planting and average yield 100-125 q/acre in 90-100 days), Kufri Pukhraj (Tall plant, vigorous and erect, susceptible to late blight but escapes due to earliness, large uniform tubers, oval, white and yields 130 q/acre in 70-90 days), Kufri Ashoka (Tall plant, erect and medium compact with green foliage, large tubers, smooth, oval long with white skin and yields about 110 q/acre in 75-80 days), Kufri Chandramukhi (white, large, smooth, white skin, uniform and more attractive and yield about 100 q/ acre in 80-90 days) and Kufri Pushkar (White tuber, resistance to late blight, good keeping quality and average yield is 160-170 q/acre in 90-100 days). Late varieties Kufri Chipsona-3 (Medium maturing 90-100 days, resistant to late blight, good keeping quality, oval and white tubers, low reducing content (100 mg per 100 g fresh weight) and high tuber dry matter (21.5%) which is required for producing light coloured chips, suitble for processing into chip and average yield is 165-175 q/acre) and Kufri Frysona (Medium maturing 90-100 days, resistant to late blight, good keeping quality, oval and white tubers, suitable for French fries due to long tubers with high dry matter (22%) and average yield is 160-170 q/acre). ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 150 Sow 20 kg of Dhaincha for green manuring from end of June to first week of July. The seed requirements for an acre on the basis of seed size are viz, large size- 10-12 q/acre medium size- 7-10 q/acre Small size- 4-6 q/acre. Dipping cut tubers in a solution of 1% Thiourea and 1 ppm Gibberellic Acid (one ml per 100 litres of water) for an hour followed by air drying the treated tuber pieces for 24 hours in thin layers in shade. To control black scurf, treat the tubers with Monceren @ 2.5 ml per litre of water for 10 minutes after taking out of the cold storage. The best time for sowing is last week of September to mid- October for the autumn crop and the second fortnight of January for the spring crop. A ridger should be used for planting the crop manually. Semi- automatic or automatic planters are recommended where tractor power is available. For mechanized planting, the spacing between the rows and tuber should be kept 65x18.5 cm or 75 cm x 15 cm respectively. Twenty tonnes of farmyard manure or green manuring alongwith 75 kg of N (165 kg of Urea), 25 kg of P2O5 (155kg of Single Superphosphate) and 25 kg of K2O (40 kg of Muriate of Potash) per acre should be used. Application of Biozyme 8 Kg granule per acre each at the time of planting and earthing up and spray of Biozyme liquid formulation at tuber initiation stage @200ml/acre increases the yield of potato.
