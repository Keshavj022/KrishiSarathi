 Total 411 accessions of trait- specific germplasm were identified in which, 92 were multi-trait specific germplasm superior for 2–5 traits simultaneously. Panicle diversity of barnyard millet germplasm resources conserved at ICAR-IIMR, Hyderabad Kodo millet (Paspalum scrobiculatum): A total of 69 accessions of core collections of kodo millet germplasm were characterized for 13 quantitative and 15 qualitative traits. Out of which 10 were early flowering (<56.00 days), 4 were with higher grain yield (>20.00 g/plant) and 17 were identified with more 100-seed weight (>0.40 g). Little millet (Panicum flexuosum): A total of 66 accessions of new little millet germplasm were characterized for 9 quantitative and 12 qualitative traits. The plant height is the most variable trait followed by days to 50% flowering and flag leaf length of blade. Four accessions were identified for early flowering (<55.00 days) and 4 with higher grain yield (>10.00 g/main plant). Panicle diversity of little millet germplasm resources conserved at ICAR-IIMR, Hyderabad Characterization at AICRP centres A total of 94,081 accessions were characterized/ evaluated at NRCS/DSR/IIMR, AICRP on sorghum and small millets centres. The accessions include germplasm, resistant source materials and segregation materials. The maximum frequency of 62,789 accessions of millets germplasm materials was characterized during 2003– 2021 in which 45,092 accessions belonged to sorghum followed by finger millet (7,002) and pearl millet (5,395); followed by 17,842 accessions for evaluation in which 11,210 belonged to sorghum followed by finger millet (2,960) and little millet (2,172). The maximum frequency of 61,817 accessions of sorghum germplasm/segregating materials characterized/evaluated in which 26,271 were characterized/evaluated at Hyderabad followed by Akola (5,300), Rahuri (4,326), etc; followed by finger millet (18,262 accessions) in which 7,202 were characterized/evaluated at Hyderabad followed by Vizianagaram and Mandya (3,157 accessions each) etc. Conservation As on 31st March 2022, a total of 48,462 accessions of millets in bulk are being conserved in the Millets Genebank (MGB) (Table 1). Sorghum was maximum with 27,366 accessions followed by finger millet (8057), foxtail millet, (4573) pearl millet (4094), proso millet (1463), barnyard millet (1159), little millet (670), kodo millet (333), tef (36), browntop millet (25), quinoa (12) and jobs tears (1).
