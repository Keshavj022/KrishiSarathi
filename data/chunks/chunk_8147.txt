 Twelve entries (VHC 3899, VHC 4103, VHC 3658, VHC 3757, VHC 3993, VHC 4074, VHC 3640, VHC 3900, VHC 4127, VHC 4200, VRB MF 1218 and VR MF 2233) were highly resistant to finger blast and moderately resistant leaf and neck blasts. Development of DNA finger print: Population structure and genetic tree of 330 rice land races obtained from Uttarakhand (151), eastern Uttar Pradesh (71), Jharkhand (37) and West Bengal (23) were generated using 30 HvSSR markers. New genomic SSR markers (67) were generated in Andrographis paniculata and diversity study carried out in 42 accessions from different geographical regions. Seventy-seven samples of varietal material from public and private sector were DNA profiled during the period using Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers. Eight genes having key roles in wheat nitrogen intake and metabolism have been predicted from analysis of wheat genome sequence data. A total of 5,818 plant genomic resources (Isolated plant genes, DNA, Libraries and others) from 41 species are being maintained in National Genomic Resource Repository at ICAR-NBPGR. Chromosomes in Luffa sp. were identified and characterized using karyotyping and FISH analysis. Six imported consignments of Arabidopsis thaliana, cotton, maize were tested to ensure absence of embryogenesis deactivator gene (terminator gene      GENETIC RESOURCES DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2018–19 29 essential for enduring extreme environmental stress faced during the spawning migration by fish. Rohu genome with 95% coverage had over 40,000 genes and functional role of around 25,000 genes was annotated. Magur genome assembly with 93% coverage had over 51,000 genes and nearly 35,000 genes were analysed for functional roles. These analyses would pave way for finding genes of important traits, such as, growth, disease resistance, etc. Sequencing genome of oomycete pathogen: Draft genome of oomycete (Aphanomyces invadans), known to cause epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS), was fully sequenced with 87% coverage. Of about 18,000 genes predicted, 636 genes were identified to be secretory in nature. EUS is one of the most destructive diseases of freshwater and brackishwater fishes. Genome sequencing would help in identification of virulence factors and thereby useful in developing novel strategies for disease management. Complete genome sequencing of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV): White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a pathogen of shrimps causing major economic losses to the aquaculture industry. Complete genome of an Indian isolate of WSSV obtained from Penaeus vannamei was decoded. The genome has 280,591 bp with 442 predicted coding genes. ❑           CROP IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2018–19 40 Variety Area of adoption Salient features Suitable for cultivation in Agro-climatic Zone-3 and 8 of Karnataka, yield: 23–25 q/ha, suitable for contingency planting, maturity: 70–72 days.
