 Inclusion of legumes as component crops helped in additional legume yield leading to nutritional security of the family and improved soil productivity and health. Similarly the adoption of other key components like use of new high yielding variety, application of fertilizers etc. showed significant influence on the yield of the crop. • All centres have met the indented requirements of the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Government of India, to produce breeder seed particularly in finger millet, kodo millet and little millet. As much as 110 q of breeder seed have been produced and supplied against the target of 90 q. www.icar.org.in 11 2002 ‐ 2007 All India Coordinated Research Project on Linseed 1.

Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): I BREEDING GENETIC RESOURCE MANAGEMENT • A total of 2806 germplasm comprising 2250 indegenous collections, 552 exotic collections and 4 wild spp. maintained under NAGS system. • 609 accessions deposited to NBPGR, for long term conservation. • Ist catalogue of 1980 germplasm documented for 29 descriptors was published in 1987. • IInd catalogue of 2053 germplasm documented for 22 descriptors was published in 2002. • 19 improved varieties were developed using potential germplasm identified for different special traits.
