 The success is attributed to improvement in pruning technology and the use of growth regulating chemicals. Grape cv. Flame Seedless and Pusa Navrang were found suitable for table and juice purpose respectively under Lucknow conditions. The vine growth, canopy development, productivity and the quality were significantly affected by various systems of training tested. The highest mean bunch weight and berry weight were recorded under Bower System of training. Downy mildew caused by Plasmopara viticola could be effectively controlled by sprays of Aliette (0.2%) + Mancozeb (0.2%) and Metalaxyl MZ (0.2%). Pre- harvest foliar spraying of Hexaconazole @ 0.05% and Mancozeb (0.2%) to control mildew should be made 30 and 60 days before harvesting, respectively to dissipate its detectable residual effect. PLANTING MATERIAL A total of 15,366 buded plants were sup- plied at Chethalli; 5,469 Kagzi lime seed- lings and 5,562 mosambi grafts were sup- plied to farmers and Govt. departments at Rahuri. Shweta Seedless provides export quality grapes DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 54 PAPAYA A total of 49 gynodioecious and 35 dioecious clones of papaya were maintained at Coimbatore. Papaya CO 2, CO 6, CO 7, CO 3 and Pusa Delicious were found more prolific for number of fruits. Foliar spray of ZnSO4 (0.5%) + H3BO3 (0.1%) 4 and 8 months after planting significantly improved the fruit latex yield. Application of neem cake @ 100 g/bag recorded effective control of nematode under pot culture. Drenching with copper oxychloride (0.1%) @ 25 ml/pot was effective to control Phytophathora root-rot. Application of 10 kg FYM, 2 kg neem cake, 1 kg Sterameal, 200g N, 250 g P2O5 and 100g K2O, 0.5% ZnSO4 and H3BO3 (1%) was found effective for the management of papaya ring spot. Neem oil (1%) and dimethoate (1.5%) also found to give good control. Papaya seedlings pre- immunized with mild strains offered higher protection for papaya ring spot virus. SAPOTA A total of 20 varieties at Gandevi, 19 at Arabhavi, 20 at Kovvur and 14 at Periyakulam were maintained and evaluated under AICRP on Tropical Fruits. Spota PKM 1 maintained its superiority in terms of growth and yield. Out of 31 hybrids evaluated at Periyakulam, hybrid progenies of Guthi × Badami showed good growth. Inarching method of grafting in June-July or September-October was found ideal. The softwood grafting was more successful in hybrids PKM 1, PKM 3 and CO 2. Density of 312 plants/ha (8 m × 4 m spacing) recorded higher yield for PKM 1. Application of 600 gN, 200 g P2O5 and 200 g K2O/plant/year in PKM 1 was found ideal under Periyakulam conditions. At Gandevi, application of 25 kg FYM, 400g N, 60 g P2O5 and 300g K2O/plant/year gave higher yields in Kallipatii. LITCHI At IIHR, Bangalore, a new tissue culture technique ‘transverse thin-cell layer’ (t- TCL) was applied to litchi Purbi for developing an alternate micropropagation protocol. Under AICRP, a total of 36 germplasm accessions were maintained at different centres.
