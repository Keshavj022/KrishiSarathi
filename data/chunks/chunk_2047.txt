 Furthermore, machine learning (ML) techniques will be applied on long-term DO and temperature data for simulating the interactions of DO and other associated parameters with stocking density, fish biomass, thereby planning the fish stocking density based on the waterbody carrying capacity. Table 1: Comparison of DO reading of different system Average DO reading SL Location LAB Test loT based DO system . (chemical method) 1. Bucket Water 6.86 7.00 2. Pond 7.26 7.20 3.

The real time before and after implementation comparison can be done after implementing in the commercial fish farm. 5. Lessons learned e The initial cost for DO sensor is high. e Continuous internet is required to upload the data in the cloud system, otherwise remote monitoring may be hampered. e Continuous power is required for functioning of the system. 6.

Appendix Appendix 1: Actor / Business role S No Actor Business role 1 Fish farm Farm where fishes are grown. The developed DO system is deployed. 2 IoT based DO monitoring system It reads the DO data from the sensor, transferred the data to the cloud, signals the aerator for start functioning when needed. The system can monitor and control the DO level in real-time with acceptable range. This helps to maintain the good water quality and promote fish growth. Appendix 2: Actor role Actor name Actor type Role description DO sensor Device It senses the DO and temperature of the water area IoT system (Micro- controller) Device It is the main processor system, reads the DO data from the sensor, transferred the data to the cloud, signals the aerator for start functioning when needed. Aerator Device Its task is to oxygenate the water column, or portions of the water column, thereby preventing the occurrence of low-DO conditions.
