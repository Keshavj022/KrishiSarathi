 Poultry AICRP on poultry breeding started in 1971, initially has two components i.e., poultry for egg and poultry for meat. Later, another component on rural poultry was added. Poultry for eggs had an objective to produce a strain cross layer with production target of 220 eggs (hen housed) in 500 days. Subsequently over the years, the target was revised to 235, 250, 270, 280, 290 and 300 eggs in 500 days/72 weeks of age with good egg size. In the XI plan the target was revised with the objective to evolve high yielding strains/strain crosses with average production performance of 305 eggs in 72 weeks (hen housed) and more than 52 g egg weight at 40 weeks of age. The poultry strains developed under AICRP have achieved the targets of annual egg production of more than 300 eggs with Athulya (ILM 90) had average annual production of 315 egg and CARI-Priya had an average of 301 eggs with better adaptability to tropical climate. Poultry for Meat had initial target to produce a broiler weighing 1500 g at 10 weeks of age with an FCR of 1:2.5, which was later revised to 1200 g at 8 weeks of age. In the XI plan, the target was revised to evolve a commercial broiler with at least 1700 g body weight at 6 weeks or 2000 g at 7 weeks with feed efficiency of less than 2.0 and less than 5% mortality up to 5 weeks of age using conventional breeding. The targets were achieved as the CARIBRO-Dhanraja developed at ICAR-CARI attained 2100 g at 7 weeks with FCR of 1.7. The commercial cross IBL-80 developed at GADVASU, Ludhiana (erstwhile PAU) also attained 2.0 kg at 7 weeks. 4.7. Camel Camel is a multipurpose animal as it can be used for milk, meat, wool, transport, race, tourism, agricultural work, decoration for ceremonial functions, and camel dance for amusement. Though camel numbers have decreased however, retention of female population in higher numbers is likely due to rising interest of rearing camel for milk purpose. ICAR-NRC Camel established on 20th Sept 1995 has taken an important initiative to establish camel milk as a human health adjuvant and camel as milch animal. Finally, combined efforts of NRCC and other government and non-government organizations have resulted in devising an operational standard for camel milk in November, 2016 by FSSAI and to recognise it in food category that promoted production and marketing of camel milk. The lactational yield of four camel breeds viz. Bikaneri, Jaisalmeri, Kachchhi, Mewari were 1223.45, 1284.66, 1802.35 and 1442.35 Kg, respectively. The lactation length in corresponding breeds were 338.18, 367.18, 435.67 and 367.71 days. The daily milk production average is estimated to be between 3-10 L during a lactation period of 12-18 months. The yield could increase to 20 L per day under improved feed, husbandry practice, water availability and veterinary care. Several value-added camel milk products have been developed to promote consumption of camel milk and milk-products.
