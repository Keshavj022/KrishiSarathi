It helps preventing diseases, besides maintaining the body metabolism for physical- and mental- well being. Food provides energy, protein, essential fats, vitamins, antioxidants and minerals to meet our daily metabolic requirement. Most of them cannot be synthesized in human body, therefore are to be supplemented through diet. Further, anti-nutritional factors present in edible parts of the food exert adverse affects on human health. Consumption of unbalanced foods affects billions of people worldwide, and leads to poor health and socio-economic conditions. So far, the focus has been on the development of high yielding varieties primarily to feed the ever increasing populations. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has improved the nutritional quality in high yielding varieties of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables and fruits. Till now more than 5600 varieties of different crops have been released of which no. of biofortified varieties is negligible. These biofortified varieties assume great significance to achieve nutritional security of the country.
