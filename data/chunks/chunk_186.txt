 The intricacies of pearlspot reproduction, characterized by monogamous behaviour and parental care, pose formidable obstacles to achieving large- scale seed production. The meticulous egg-laying and guarding behaviours, combined with the species’ low fecundity, present significant challenges for traditional hatchery methods, rendering them economically unviable. One of the primary challenges in pearlspot seed production lies in its low fecundity when compared to species like Carp fish. The prolonged nursery-rearing period and the distinctive parental care behaviour exhibited by pearlspot further compound the difficulties in large-scale seed production. These factors set it apart from other fish species, presenting unique hurdles that demand innovative solutions for sustainable aquaculture. Addressing these challenges is crucial for meeting the increasing demand for pearlspot and enhancing its commercial viability in the market. In addressing these challenges, ICAR-KVK, Ernakulam has undertaken an initiative to significantly enhance seed production by utilizing pond systems instead of the commonly followed hatchery method. This innovative approach presents a promising solution to bridge the existing demand-supply gap.

"ICAR-Krishi Vigyan Kendra (Ernakulam), Narakkal, Kochi, Kerala 682 505 Pearlspot (Etroplus suratensis), known as Karimeen, holds cultural and culinary significance in Kerala and is designated the ‘State Fish of Kerala’. With an annual demand of 10,000 MT for 'Kerala Karimeen’ far exceeding the production of 2,000 MT, there is a growing interest in pearlspot culture. However, limited availability of seeds, with an annual requirement of 40 million, poses a critical challenge. Addressing the low fecundity and unique reproductive behaviours of pearlspot, this article introduces an innovative seed production approach in pond systems. The article emphasizes pond preparation for optimal conditions, brood fish management, facilitating breeding environments, breeding behaviours etc. are explored. Parental care, predator control, economic and marketing aspects are also discussed. The innovative pond system approach emerges as a promising solution for making quality seeds available for pearlspot aquaculture.
