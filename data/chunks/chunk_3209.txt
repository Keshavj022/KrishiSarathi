Crop Production technology : (i) Nutrient management : In order to sustain the soil health and crop productivity, FYM (20 t/ha) or sulphitation press mud cake (SPMC)@10 t/ha + trash compost @ 5 t/ha to be applied before cane planting or green manuring once in the crop cycle with recommended dose of NPK to each crop may be adopted in the sugarcane based cropping system. www.icar.org.in 92 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science In order to sustain higher cane and sugar yield from sugarcane plant ratoon system, plant crop should be fertilized with 100% of the recommended NPK fertilizers + 25% N through FYM + biofertilizer (Azotobacter + PSB) and ratoon crop be fertilized with 100% of the recommended NPK through inorganics + trash incorporation with cellulytic culture + biofertilizer. SSP and DAP are equally effective as sources of phosphorus. In north‐west, north‐east and east coast zones, sugarcane crop may be fertilized with 60 kg P2O5/ha. However, in peninsular zone, DAP is superior to SSP and sugarcane crop be fertilized with 60‐80 kg P2O5/ha. As regards, zinc nutrition, 20‐30 kg ZnSO4/ha is sufficient. New promising genotypes should be adopted to replace existing old/low yielding varieties. Sugarcane crop in peninsular and east coast zones may be fertilized with 25% more NPK over recommended dose of NPK. However, in north‐west, north central and north east zones, recommended dose of NPK is adequate to meet nutritional requirement of promising sugarcane genotypes. (ii) Management of sulphur deficiency in soil : Sulphur @ 40‐60 kg/ha in sugarcane plant crop needs to be applied in sulphur deficient soils. As regards source of sulphur, gypsum proved more effective and economical. (iii) Ratoon management: Under multiple ratooning, integration of agro‐technologies viz., stubble shaving, gap filling, trash mulching and cultivation in alternate rows with the use of phorate (15 kg/ha) may be adopted to sustain higher ratoon cane yields. Keeping ratoon beyond third does not appear to be economical. As component technology, trash mulching and gap filling have been identified as critical technologies to sustain multiple ratoon productivity.
