 Konkan Kapila: Animals of Konkan Kapila (INDIA_CATTLE_1135_KONKANKAPILA_03043), distributed in Konkan region of Maharashtra and Goa, are predominantly of reddish brown/black coat; however white/grey, mixed, fawn are also available. The animals are small to medium with compact body, straight face, small to medium size hump and dewlap. Generally straight and small size horn emerge from side of the poll behind and above eyes in outward and going upwards and backwards ending with pointed tips. Konkan Kapila cattle are low milk producers (around 2.25 kg/day) and possess good draught ability suited to hilly terrain and hot and humid climate of its native tract. Luit buffalo (Swamp): The Luit swamp buffaloes (INDIA_BUFFALO_0212_LUIT_01014) are distributed mostly in upper Brahmaputra valley of Assam and in some areas of Mizoram, Manipur and Nagaland bordering Assam. Luit is a medium size black buffalo with compact body and strong built up. Forehead is broad with conical face and wide muzzle. Eyes are prominent. Horns are broad at base, curved upward to form a semi circle and taper to a narrow tip. Light white stockings up to the knee are present in both fore and hind legs. Tail is short reaching up to the hocks. Udder is bowl shaped and small in size. Lactation milk yield ranges from 385 to 505 kg. Bullocks are excellent draught animals for carting and ploughing especially in muddy field for paddy cultivation. Chemical profiling of Dendrobium nobile orchid GC-MS analysis of methanol extract of native Dendrobium nobile orchid revealed presence of 16 compounds having several medicinal properties. and added to the core collection. In grape germplasm, accessions with prominent berry diameter (14 nos), bunch compactness (3 nos.) and coloured pulp (6 nos.) were identified. In date palm, one early maturing (mid July) elite seedling variant (CIAH/DP/S-2) with 18–20 berry per strand; 10 g berry weight and 37 kg/palm yield was identified. Three arecanut accessions SCRDTC-18, Kamrup and Dangapara indicated higher tender nut yield potential. In cocoa, VTLC 13 and VTLC 20 clones of Nigerian origin, with 3 kg dry bean yield/ tree/ year, were identified as promising clones for cultivation in areca- nut and coconut cropping systems. In water melon, a high carotenoid (7 to 7.2 µg/g FW) content germplasm accession (YF 5-2-7) was identified. Onion genotypes [W 208, Acc. 1630, Acc. 1622, and RGP 5 (advance line)] tolerant to excess soil moisture stress with good survival (100%) and recovery (>80%) under artificial water- logging condition, were identified. Four onion genotypes (Acc. 1656, W 448, W 397, RGP 3) tolerant to limited moisture stress with less than 30% reduction in bulb yield were identified. Improved germplasm accessions of coriander (UD-353) with higher yield (12.03 q/ha), two cumin accessions with higher seed yield (AC-WMT-16- 40 with 5.63 q/ha and CE-15 with 4.94 q/h), one fenugreek (B5-5-6-1 with 9.7 q/ha), two fennel accessions (AF-01-521 with 25.
