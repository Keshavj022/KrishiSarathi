 In the area of Women in Agriculture, major findings of the All-India Co-ordinated Research Project on Home Science include: identification of 36 new sources of natural dyes, enhancement in work efficiency with improved tools, and development of nine technology kits consisting of multimedia resource materials for knowledge empowerment of extension workers. The National Research Centre for Women in Agriculture (NRCWA) organized 30 training programmes benefiting 887 farm women. In addition, KVKs have imparted training to 1.10 lakh farm women in different specialised activities. Under Research for Tribal and Hill Regions, salient achievements of the Vivekananda Parvatiya Krishi Anusandhan Sansthan, Almora, are: the release of VL Gehun 804 of wheat and Vivek Matar 8 of pea for northern hill zone, and VL Madira 181 of barnyard millet for Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu; identification of Vivek Sankul Makka 11 maize composite and VLT 9531 tomato for release in Uttaranchal; two short-duration blast- resistant rice strains and a exotic capsicum line VHC 12 for release in Uttaranchal hills; development of low-cost, poly-tunnel technology for 1-month advance production of capsicum and tomato during winter; and reduction in blast score and stem-borer incidence in organically fertilized basmati rice plots compared to chemically fertilized ones. The studies conducted at the ICAR Research Complex for NEH, Umiam, resulted in the release of four varieties of rice, collection of 1,645 germplasm, release of Megha Turmeric 1 variety of turmeric, preparation of citrus- rejuvenation package and production of tissue-cultured disease-free material for farming community, reduction in HCN content of bamboo leaves for feeding livestock, development of DNA-based rapid diagnosis techniques for salmonella and clostridial diseases, revelation of watershed-based technologies to reduce soil loss, perfection of technology for processing of soybean into soya milk, paneer and biscuits, and training of farmers of DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002â€“2003 8 03-004-01.p65\8\(28.02.03\06.03.03) NEH region for using and manufacturing modified agricultural implements. The Central Agricultural Research Institute, Port Blair, recommended staggered planting at 1-month intervals for round-the-year availability of tuberose flowers; developed brinjal somaclones and herbal antimicrobial, anti- inflammatory and anti-histaminic formulation, mouth wash and vaginal contraceptive; produced on a large-scale, Quicken, a fertile intergeneric hybrid of quail; standardized for the first-time common clown (Amphiprion percula) culturing in India; and achieved successful larval rearing of Macrobrachium rosenbergii and production of juveniles. In the organization and management (O&M) programme of National Agricultural Technology Project, the O&M Task Force has made several sub-committees on various aspects of reforms.
