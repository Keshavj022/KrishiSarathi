 However, in the subsoil, the lower SOC content of forest (7.71 ± 0.25) and ZT (8.80 ± 0.47) as compared to CT (8.94 ± 1.03) may be due to less incorporation of crop residues to deeper depths (Chao et al., 2019). Although the SOC (%) in surface soil (0–5 cm) was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) by conversion of forest land to con­ ventional tillage practices from 27.47 ± 0.21 g kg−1 to 11.00 ± 0.09 g kg−1, but by adopting conservation agriculture practices, the SOC was significantly improved to 17.98 ± 0.07 g kg−1. Furthermore, the soil TN concentrations (g kg−1) reduced as soil depth increased across all treatments, as presented in Fig. 4(B). The vertical variations of TN concentrations changed across treatments as well. In the surface soil, the TN content of forest (2.02 ± 0.29) and ZT (1.28 ± 0.01) were significantly higher than RT (0.85 ± 0.03) and CT (0.86 ± 0.10), although there was no significant difference between RT and CT. The soil TN ranged from 2.02 ± 0.29 (0–5 cm) to 0.59 ± 0.07 (25–30 cm) under forest, 1.28 ± 0.01 (0–5 cm) to 0.64 ± 0.04 (25–30 cm) under ZT, 0.85 ± 0.03 (0–5 cm) to 0.70 ± 0.02 (10–15 cm) under RT and 0.86 ± 0.10 (5–10 cm) to 0.70 ± 0.09 (25–30 cm) under CT. The maximum TN concentration was found under forest lands at 0 to 15 cm soil depth, whereas, beyond 15 cm soil depth, RT showed the highest TN. However, beyond 15 cm soil depth, there were no significant TN content differences among land uses or depth-wise. The depth-wise variation among land uses followed the same pattern as the distribu­ tion of SOC. The TN content in forest and conservation agriculture land use may be associated with adding agricultural residues and litter on the soil surface, less soil disturbance, and less soil nitrogen mineralization (Patra et al., 2019a). Moreover, after plough depth (> 15 cm), neither the tillage nor the crop residue addition had any impact on soil total nitrogen distribution, and it may be due to minimal soil disturbance, less SOM input, and mixing of soil below this depth. 3.2. Stratification ratio of MWD and SOM The stratification ratio of MWD (mm) under different land use practices is presented in Fig. 5. Under all treatments, the SR of MWD rose considerably (p < 0.05) with increasing soil depth from 0–5:5–10 to 0–5:25–30 cm soil depths. The SR of MWD followed the trend Forest> ZT > RT > CT for all soil depth ratios, indicating a decrease in SR with increased tillage intensity. In the surface 0–5:5–10 soil depth, the SRs among the land uses were not significantly different; however, from 0–5:15–20 soil depth onwards, the SRs were significantly different among them. Moreover, the ZT land use indicated substantially higher SR values than RT and CT. The SR values of MWD varied from 2.01 ± 1.17 (0–5:5–10) to 5.57 ± 1.83 (0–5:25–30) for the forest, 1.50 ± 0.38 (0–5:5–10) to 3.56 ± 0.63 (0–5:25–30) for ZT, 0.97 ± 0.17 (0–5:5–10) to 2.26 ± 0.04 (0–5:25–30) for RT and 0.98 ± 0.05 (0–5:10–15) to 1.67 ± 0.01 (0–5:25–30) for CT.
