, 2018) Total numbers of irrigation in the crop cycle No of irrigation indicates availability in all seasons. High value (+) reduce AWPI Survey New Indicator: Sufficient frequency of irrigation help to have cooling effect and increase sugarcane productivity. Sugarcane is water demanding crop. Water Resource Availability at Farm level during crop cycle is considered (Zhao and Li, 2015) Access Uncultivated land due to water shortage Due to shortage of access land is uncultivated. Low value (-) reduce AWPI Survey [5] Conflict about distribution or sharing of water sources from canal boundary and with the pipelines Conflicts for water distribution Low value (-) reduce AWPI Survey [5] Satisfaction about the location of the farm from water source (Canal) Satisfaction level of farmers about the location of farm from source High value (+) reduce AWPI Survey [5] Mean of the distance of farm from water sources Mean distance of farm from water sources Low value (-) reduce AWPI Survey & Observation [5] Soil Texture (Proportion of clay content) Suitability of soil texture for water retention High value (+) reduce AWPI (SoilGrids â€” Global Gridded Soil Information, n.d.) [5] Land Slope at Farm Level Suitable slope from water retention & drainage point of view Low value (-) reduce AWPI (Near Global 90 Meter Resolution Elevation Data : DIVA-GIS Data, n.d.) [5] Use Yield to Average Rainfall Ratio Yield per rainfall give idea of better use of resources, indirectly water High value (+) reduce AWPI Survey &(CHRS Data Portal, 2020) New indicator: Sugarcane yield per acre with the available rainfall in the region depend on agronomic practices (time of planting, etc.). This results in the using rainfall to the fullest. Yield to Number of water resources Ratio Number of water sources needed to get sufficient yield High value (+) reduce AWPI Survey & Observation New indicator: Productivity of sugarcane with the available water resources indicate use efficiency.
