 Using this setup, we built separate models for (1) resident bird species richness and abundance comprising 118 species recorded, (2) abundance and species richness of the Palearctic migratory bird species, and (3) guild-specific abundance of the Palearctic migratory bird species that were grouped into three habitat and diet guilds, namely carnivores, species preferring open ground, and species preferring shrubs. For a given survey point, we accounted for the varia- tion in bird response C for a given survey point i by assuming it to be a Poisson process: Ci  Poisson λi ð Þ, where Ci is the vector of possible bird responses (abun- dance, richness, in {0,1,2,3,…, N}) at point i, and λi are the expected mean values of the bird response. We fitted the following model using the generic formula: log λ0 ð Þ ¼ α0,i + β1 proportion of semi −perennial crops ð Þ + β2 mean field size ð Þ + β3 proportion of woody vegetation cover ð Þ + β4 proportion of annual crops ð Þ + β5 Shannon0s diversity index land cover diversity ð ð ÞÞ + β6 mean elevation ð Þ + β7 built −up ð Þ, where α0,i are the varying regression intercepts as ran- dom sample point effects defined to be drawn from a nor- mal distribution with a mean μα and variance σ2α as estimated hyper-parameters: α0,i  Normal μα,σ2 α   : We added elevation and the proportion of built-up (e.g., infrastructural developments) as control covariates, using data from the Open Buildings dataset (v3) (Sirko et al., 2021). This was done because there was a tendency for grasslands to be situated at higher elevations, and because synanthropic bird species might reach higher diversity and abundance in areas with more human habitation. RESULTS We used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algo- rithm to derive posterior distributions from four chains, each consisting of 6000 iterations with a burn-in of 2000 iterations which were sufficient to achieve convergence (bR < 1:1). All models had a good fit. For posterior predic- tive distributions see Appendix S1: Figures S6 and S7. A high proportion of land cover diversity had a strong, positive effect on resident (n = 118) species richness (high certainty, β = 0.110, 95% CI = 0.034, 0.184) and abundance (high certainty, β = 0.055, 95% CI = 0.006, 0.104) (Figure 4), and a strong negative effect on the abundance of Palearctic migratory (n = 26) species (high certainty, β = −0.278, 95% CI = −0.398, −0.159), especially on species preferring shrubs (high certainty, β = −0.352, 95% CI = −0.501, −0.206) (Figure 5). A high abundance of both resident (high certainty, β = 0.067, 95% CI = 0.028, 0.107) and Palearctic migratory (high certainty, β = 0.285, 95% CI = 0.199, 0.371) was associated with a high amount of annual crops (Figure 4), especially in shrub-inhabiting migrants (high certainty, β = 0.355, 95% CI = 0.258, 0.453) (Figure 5). A high proportion of semi-perennial crops had a posi- tive effect on resident species richness (high certainty, 8 of 17 BHAGWAT ET AL. β = 0.
