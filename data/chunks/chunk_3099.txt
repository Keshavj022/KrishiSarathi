Amelioration practices recommended under National food Security Mission 3.2.1 Micronutrients • In zinc deficient soils, zinc deficiency can be corrected by application of zinc sulphate hepta hydrate (21% Zn), mono hydrate (33% Zn), zinc chelate (Zinc EDTA) and zinc phosphate. Zinc sulphate hepta hydrate is the most cheap, common, easily available and efficient source of zinc for correcting zinc deficiency in soils and crops. Zinc chelate are very costly hence less cost effective when applied in soil. www.icar.org.in 57 2002‐2007 • Application of zinc sulphate at the rate of 25 kg ha‐1 equivalent to 5.5 kg Zn ha‐1 is found optimum for correcting zinc deficiency in marginal soils and 50 kg zinc sulpahte ha‐1 for highly deficient soil. If deficiency is severe rate of application of zinc sulphate /ha may be increased to 50kg/ha which increases the yield and benefits significantly (2.60‐ 10.0 q/ha over no zinc application). • Basal soil application through broadcast is good, but if soil application is missed, the same may be top dressed within 30‐45 days after sowing at the time of first irrigation. • If soil application is missed, sprays of 5 g per litre zinc sulphate solution neutralized with 2.5 g 2.5 per litre lime or 2 g per litre zinc chelate solution two to three times in 300‐500 litres per hectare at 7‐10 days interval between 20‐45 days of germination also corrects zinc deficiency quite efficiently. So about 3‐4 kg zinc chelate/ha or 7.5‐10 kg zinc sulphate /ha is required for three to four foliar sprays. • Foliar application of 0.5% ferrous sulphate un neutralized two to four times on standing crops or horticultural plants is found beneficial in correcting iron deficiency. Crops suffering from iron and zinc deficiency needs mixed foliar spray of 0.25% zinc sulphate and ferrous sulphate twice to thrice for correcting such nutritional disorders in plants. 3.2.2 Sulphur • Sulphur deficiency can be corrected by applying 20‐40 kg S/ha, through basal application of either of the sulphur sources like single super phosphate, gypsum/phosphogypsum , gromor sulphur, ammonium sulphate. • All sulphur sources are equally efficient and enhance the crop yield and improve the quality of produce.
