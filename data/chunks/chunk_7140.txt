 Established milkfish brain cell line MFB-1 for in vitro propagation of beta nodavirus: Created a new cell line MFB-1 from the brain of milkfish (Chanos chanos). The MFB-1 cells were characterized by karyotyping (2n=32). The cells were confirmed using cox1 marker gene and sequence submitted to NCBI database (Genbank accession no. MN836380). The MFB-1 cell line was established successfully with stable growth. The established MFB-1 cell line was inoculated with the RGNNV strain of beta nodavirus and the virus was adapted by five passages. Nested RT-PCR confirmed the viral presence. Thus, MFB-1 cell line was found suitable for in vitro multiplication of beta nodavirus. K 72%. The harvesting efficiency and bulb damage during the operation are 97% and <0.5%, respectively. Tractor operated pigeon pea harvester A tractor front mounted hydraulically operated two- row pigeon pea harvester was developed. The harvester was evaluated in the plain field. The field capacity was 0.55 ha/h and operating cost was ` 930/ha. It saved 40% cost and 96% labour when compared with manual method of harvesting. Lightweight multi-crop thresher for hills A lightweight multi-crop thresher was developed for threshing wheat, paddy, minor millets, and amaranth crops commonly grown in Uttarakhand hills; 1 hp single phase electric motor was used to run the thresher. The threshing capacity of the machine for wheat, paddy, barnyard millet, finger millet and amaranth, was observed as 34, 75, 58, 54, and 30 kg/h, respectively. The threshing efficiency was more than or equal to 98% for these crops. Cleaning efficiency was more than 95% for the above crops. The multi-crop thresher would benefit hill farmers by saving time and labour and reducing the drudgery involved in the traditional/manual threshing operations. Tractor operated drainage trencher for laying sub- surface pipes A tractor operated drainage trencher for laying sub-surface pipes was developed and evaluated. The developed trencher can make the trench up to the depth of 1.0–1.1 m with width of 150–160 mm. The operating speed of the trencher was 0.3 km/h. Machine can dug the trench at the rate of 250–365 m/h with depth ranging from 250 to 1,000 mm and lay a drainage pipe subsequently at desired grade. The cost of the developed trencher was worked out to be ` 300,000 and cost of operation is about ` 1,300/h. The field efficiency of the machine was 81.2%. The developed unit can save the cost over existing machine to the tune of 40–50%, and will increase the annual use of the tractor. 9. Mechanization and Energy Management Tractor operated drip lateral-cum-plastic mulch laying machine A tractor operated variable width raised bed drip lateral-cum-plastic mulch laying machine was developed and evaluated. This machine is able to form bed of 0.6 to 1.0 m in width and 0.15 m in height. A 45 HP tractor was suitable for operating the system. The field capacity and field efficiency of the machine were 0.
