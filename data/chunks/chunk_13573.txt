Ranguwal et al. Energy Nexus 11 (2023) 100238 4 respectively, input-wise assessment demonstrated the high consumption of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) fertilizers in Punjab. The power consumed by crop protection chemicals such as insecticides, weed killers, and herbicides to protect crops was calculated and found to be highest in maize and lowest in paddy. The energy utilization ranged from 1.20 to 3.1% of the total energy input, from 0.42 GJ ha−1 in paddy to 1.56 GJ ha−1 in sugarcane. This complies with recommended crop management procedures for applying herbicides to minimize yield reductions. The flood irrigation technique employed for paddy production in the state, which maintains water standing for at least 45 days after trans­ planting the crop, is to account for the high energy consumption for irrigation. Paddy requires far more water (per hectare) compared to other Kharif crops. The excessive groundwater pumping (12,000 m3) and inefficient water pumping systems, which result in high electricity consumption. These findings were previously supported by a study from Karnataka that showed N fertilizers and irrigation water were used indiscriminately and accounted for 36% and 39% of the total energy input in the transplanted paddy [60]. In a growing season, it was discovered that maize only needed 10–12 irrigations, used 4.4 GJ ha−1 of electricity, and made up 19% of the entire energy input. Cotton was shown to have the lowest percentage (3%) of power input in the total energy input among other crops, perhaps due to its low water requirement. With the exception of sugarcane, which accounted for 64.9% of the total energy input expended in seed, energy expended in the seeds for sowing crops had been remarkably insignificant. The reason for this is that the sugarcane ratoon produces 7.5 tonnes of weighted, hefty seed each acre. In all the crops, the shares of energy balance accounted for by labor—human, animal, FYM, and plant protection chemical—were modest, ranging from 1% to 2.6%.
