The marginal effects showed that me­ dium and large farmers have higher adoption rates of drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, and combined irrigation systems, ranging from 4.6% to 13.0%, whereas small and marginal farmers have lower adop­ tion rates, ranging from 1.0% to 2.0%. Thus, the size of landholding and access to irrigation are key factors that influence the adoption of irri­ gation technologies. In addition, the majority of orchid and plantation crops are covered by drip irrigation, and large and medium farmers who have already adopted the technology can use it for other suitable crops. However, small and marginal farmers may find it difficult to shift their cropping patterns, as reported by Kumar (2016), given that 86.0% of farmers are smallholders, according to Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, 2021. Finally, access to irrigation through tube wells, rivers, canals, and other water bodies was found to be statistically highly significant and posi­ tively associated with the adoption of micro-irrigation technologies, as expected. The source of irrigation significantly affects MI technology adoption, with regions highly reliant on groundwater (tube wells), such as Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, showing a strong inclination towards adopting MI technologies (Dhawan, 2017). Nonetheless, certain state policies have led to distorted water prices and the overexploitation of water resources, highlighting the urgent need for effective groundwater management. This underscores our expectation of a positive influence from this variable on the adoption of MI technologies. The marginal effect analysis shows that farmers who used tube wells for irrigation had significantly higher adoption rates of irrigation tech­ nologies, ranging from 8.2% to 15.8%. The second-highest adoption rates were observed among farmers who used river or canal water for irrigation, ranging from 3.7% to 12.2%, while farmers who used other water sources had adoption rates ranging from 7.0% to 9.0%. These results can be explained by the fact that farmers in semi-arid regions mainly depend on groundwater resources, which are the primary source of water for tube wells. The results show that cooperative societies and self-help groups have both positive and negative impacts on the adoption of MI technologies. They provide support to their members, indirectly aiding in technology adoption, but there is a maximum limit of 5 ha per beneficiary for accessing this support (Government of India, 2010).
