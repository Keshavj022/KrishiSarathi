 Inadequate facilities for sorting, packaging, and transportation can affect the quality and marketability of the products. Pest and Disease Control: Certain horticulture crops are vulnerable to pests and diseases, which can affect both quality and quantity. Implementing effective pest and disease control measures, especially in remote areas, can be a challenge. Increasing Awareness among Local Farmers Awareness of GI Benefits: Many local farmers and producers in Northeastern India may not fully understand the benefits of GI tagging. They may lack awareness of how GI tags can enhance the value of their products and provide protection from imitation. Educating and raising awareness among these stakeholders is crucial. Traditional Farming Practices: Traditional farming practices, while contributing to the distinctiveness of these products, may not always align with GI requirements. Local farmers may be reluctant to alter their methods to meet GI standards, fearing that it could compromise the traditional aspects of their cultivation. Collective Action: To obtain GI tags, local producers often need to come together and form associations or cooperatives. Coordinating collective action and ensuring the active participation of all stakeholders can be a challenge, as it requires building trust and addressing potential conflicts of interest. CONCLUSION Northeastern horticulture commodities have great potential for growth and Geographical Indication recognition, but administrative hurdles, standardisation issues, and farmer awareness must be addressed. Overcoming these challenges will boost the local economy and preserve the region’s cultural and agricultural heritage. Government agencies, non-governmental organisations, and local communities must collaborate to support GI tagging. Northeastern India’s horticultural commodities’ GI recognition recognises its agricultural diversity, cultural heritage, and economic potential. GI tags indicate geographical origin and protect traditional farming methods and unique qualities that make these products special. GI tags boost regional growth, price realisation, and market presence. These tags help consumers worldwide appreciate the unique flavours and cultural significance of these commodities, potentially boosting exports, tourism, and regional enrichment. Northeastern India’s culture and sustainable farming are promoted by GI tagging. GI tags’ high quality standards build consumer and market trust in Northeastern horticultural products. As more of its exceptional fruits, vegetables, and spices become GI-recognized, Northeastern India will grow and shine globally, protecting and celebrating its rich cultural and horticultural heritage.
