 Marker free late blight resistant transgenic line KJ 66 of potato: The mendelian pattern of segregation of RB event SP 951 in potato Kufri Jyoti progenies revealed marker and plasmid backbone free KJ 66 line in Chromosome Level assembly of pomegranate cv. Bhagawa Outer to inner rings : (1) Chromosome (2) SNPs (3) INDELs (4) Genes (5) Repeats Crop Improvement icar annual report 2022-23 63 Kufri Jyoti background. The line was selected to conduct the Biosafety research trial for evaluating the field resistance to late blight disease. The event KatSP951 was crossed with cultivar Kufri Jyoti and approximately 1,000 hybrid true potato seed were obtained and progeny F1 plants were screened for the presence of the Rpi-blb1 and nptII-containing inserts. The progeny line KJ 66 of potato was identified as containing only the Rpi-blb1 insert on chromosome 4. Generation of functional genetic resources for nutrient rich potatoes using activation tagging: A total 1047 activation tagged lines were generated in potato cv. Kufri Jyoti and Kufri Chipsona using activation tagging vector pSKI015. Altered morphological and physiological traits, including multiple main stem formation, high tuber yield, deformed and elongated tuber shapes and enhanced nutrition were observed in selected activation tagged lines. The positions of T-DNA insertion in different lines was also identified using genome walking technique. Genetic improvement of oyster mushroom: Molecular identification and diversity of 25 Pleurotus mushrooms were investigated. Based on their banding profile, a total 219 polymorphic bands were detected. Unweighted Pair-Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) based dendrogram was created and diverse strains were identified. The eight cross combinations were identified viz. DMRP 7 × DMRP 11, DMRP 4 × DMRP 19, DMRP 3× DMRP 19, DMRP 1 × DMRP 19, DMRP 2 × DMRP 8, DMRP 2 × DMRP 14, DMRP 2 × DMRP 25 and DMRP 18 × DMRP 23 for genetic improvement in future breeding. P1802, (hybrid of DMRP 49 and DMRP 30) DNA Barcoding profile of four mushroom species of ITS rRNA gene of Pleurotus using MEGA: Seven new hybrid strains of Pleurotus were developed by mating single spores from Pleurotus ostreatus (DMRP 30) and Pleurotus florida (DMRP 49). The maximum biological efficiency was recorded for hybrid P18102 (79.00%) in two flushes compared to parents and check on pasteurized wheat straw. ❑ Targeted Editing of Potato Genome to Develop Variety Specific True Potato Seed (Tps) A total of 16 lines of potato with mutation within MiMe genes (StOSD, StREC8 and StSP011) were generated. Further, 14 independent events with mutation in target region of CENH3 gene were selected and crossed with control Kufri Jyoti plants for evaluation of haploid induction efficiency. The obtained TPS were germinated and screened for haploid induction efficiency using FACS and Sanger sequencing. The haploid induction efficiency ranging between 10-15.7% was observed in five CENH3 edited lines of potato.
