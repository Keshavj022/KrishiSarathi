 Several health benefits of cow milk such as enhancing tissue regeneration, and immune response for disease resistance and considered as a good food during convalescent period have been described in Ayurveda. India possesses large repository of cattle genetic resource diversity with a population of 193.46 million as per 20th Livestock census, which is 2nd highest in the world and showing an increase of 1.34% over previous Census. Cattle is the most prominent species of Indian Livestock with 36.04% share in Indian Livestock population. Crossbred / exotic purebred cattle constitute around 51.36 million showing an increase of 29.3% over the previous census, while the indigenous/non-descript constitute around 142.11 million showing a decrease of 6%. Out of total 74.59 million breedable cows, exotic/crossbred cows are 26.08 million and indigenous cows are 48.51 million. Presently, country has 50 registered cattle breeds distributed in their respective breeding tracts and can be classified according to their utility as milch (4), dual (10) and draft (36) and rest are non-descript desi cattle i.e., those which do not have definite or uniform characteristics like well-defined breeds. Theannual milk yield in India in 2018-19 was 187.75 million tonnes (Mt), of which 48% is contributed by the cattle (21% by the Indigenous cattle). Annual yield per cow in India is 1642.9 kg against the global average of 2430.2 kg (FAO 2017). The per capita availability of milk is 394 g day-1 and Punjab is at the top with an average availability of more than 1100 g. Apart from milk, Indian cattle also contribute towards draft power (30.77 million bullocks), and production of bio-manure, fuel, medicines and leather. 28 Mahatma Gandhi’s Vision of Agriculture: Achievements of ICAR The Indian cattle have capacity to withstand harsh climatic conditions making them economically suitable and sustainable in their habitats. These unique attributes of some of the Indian breeds have been used in the Latin American countries, Australia and southern parts of United States for crossbreeding with Bos taurus for beef and dairy production. Few countries have imported selected indigenous breeds and are maintaining improved zebu breeds, viz. Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal by Brazil, West Indies, Australia and Kenya, and Ongole breed by Brazil and Indonesia as purebreds for milk and meat. Considering the importance of Indian breeds, continuous efforts are being made by Govt. of India and ICAR for the genetic improvement of Indigenous cattle breeds through various breed improvement programmes. In 2009, cattle genome was fully mapped (Christine et al. 2009). 2. Gandhiji’s Views on Cow For Mahatma Gandhi “Cow” had very high place in life and spirituality as he said, “The cow to me means the entire sub-human world extending man’s sympathies beyond his own species”. Another symbol in the Gandhian proto-ecological worldview is the cow.
