 Under the NATP the Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP) guidelines were revised by strengthening the research component, and these are currently being utilized for developing effective SREPs. The Academy provided policy support to ICAR on performance appraisal of scientists-a new methodology in conformity with the project based budgeting and training needs assessment for ICAR employees which is being implemented at ICAR headquarters.

The study is based on the meta-analysis. The available micro-level studies from 310 watersheds were amassed. Watershed programmes were launched to improve efficiency, equity and sustainability of natural resources in the rainfed areas. To document these benefits, few proxy indicators were chosen and analyzed. The benefit-cost ratio and the internal rate of return were used as proxy for efficiency-gains from watershed programmes. Additional employment generation in agriculture as a consequence of watershed activities was assessed for equity benefits. The sustainability benefits were demonstrated by four indicators (i) increased water storage capacity, which augmented the irrigated area, (ii) increased cropping intensity, (iii) reduced run-off, which enhanced groundwater recharge, and (iv) subsided soil loss. Benefits of Watershed Programmes Benefits of Watershed Programmes Benefits of Watershed Programmes Benefits of Watershed Programmes Benefits of Watershed Programmes Benefits derived from numerous studies are quite impressive. The watershed programmes performed reasonably well and the investment was logically justified in the fragile and uncertain environments. The mean additional annual employment generated were about 181 man-days. Watershed programmes are largely aimed at conserving soil and water to raise farm productivity. Augmenting water storage capacity contributed in (i) reducing rate of runoff, and (ii) increasing groundwater recharge. These have direct impact on expanding the irrigated area and increasing cropping intensity. On an average, the former increased by about 34%, while the later by 64%. Such an impressive increase in the cropping intensity was not realised in many surface irrigated areas in the country.
