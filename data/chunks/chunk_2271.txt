 Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) Consortium DSR consortium is engaged to identify risk- reducing practices for successful establishment of DSR, identify rice varieties suitable for DSR for different environments, develop integrated weed management options in DSR, evaluate the performance of drip irrigation system in DSR-based cropping systems and evaluate DSR performance in different cropping system in different environment. At ISARC, Varanasi, Drip irrigation DSR reduced irrigation water application by 75 to 85% compared to surface flood irrigation method in DSR or puddled transplanted rice with similar yields.

Out of 150+ varieties demanded, first 58 varieties constitute 99% of total demand. A total demand of 58,862 tons registered against previous yearâ€™s sale of 27,500 ton by OSSC. Rice Doctor user testing was done with DoA in the districts of Puri, Nayagarh, Jagatsinghpur and Cuttack and with Odisha Livelihoods Mission (OLM) in the districts of Nayagarh and Sundergarh and post graduate students of Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT). Content write shop was conducted with support from National Rice Research Institute (NRRI), OUAT, DoA to validate and finalize the content for Rice Doctor Odisha. Dissemination of Rice Doctor Odisha is in progress with DoA and farmers. Planning to integrate Rice Doctor Odisha into ongoing government programs viz., e-pest surveillance and Fasal Suraksha Abhyan.
