 Verma, Professor, Department of Bio-Sciences and Shri Chaman Lal, Scientific Assistant, Department of Bio- Sciences, Himachal Pradesh University, Summerhill, Shimla (Himachal Pradesh) 171 005  PEST AND DISEASE MANGEMENT METHODOLOGY PRA and field study Field trials were conducted for evaluation of above mentioned eco-friendly insecticide against wheat aphid and armyworm on wheat variety HS- 295 at Regional Research Station, Himachal Pradesh Krishivisavidalya, Dhaulakuan, Sirmour district, and at Mountain Research and Development Associates experiment field station in Theog area of Himachal Pradesh during 2002â€“ 2003. This disclosed ITK was in use since a long time, and during the present PRA studies only a few elderly farmers knew about this method of insect control, as it is now replaced by modern method of chemical control. Experiment Six treatments were adopted i.e.control, cow urine (CU), cow urine (CU) + Vitex nigundo (50:50), cow urine (CU) + Ferula a safoetida (FA) (50:50), cow urine (CU) + Vitex nigundo (VN) + Ferula asafoetida (FA) (50:25:25) and monocrotophos (0.05%). Each formulation was sprayed in six different plots with 50 plants each. The insecticides were applied at ear-emergence stage. Mean aphids and armyworm incidence was recorded from 10 randomly selected plants per plot on 1, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 day after the first spray. A total of three sprays were given at 45 days after sowing and thereafter repeated on 20 and 40 days (i.e 20 days interval). Data obtained from the various studies were statistically analysed using t-test and F test to find out the level of significance. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results on the effectiveness of bio- and chemical insecticide are summarized in Tables 1 to 3 and Figs 1 to 3. The chemical composition of the cow urine as revealed in the literature is given in Annexure I. Ecological habitat, chemical composition and properties of asafotetida or Table 1.
