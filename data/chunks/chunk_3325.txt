Pusa 372 15.33 115 12.76 Rainfed, UP, CZ 13 Annual Report 2016-17 6.2 Plant Pathology Evaluation of 252 chickpea entries of IVT, AVT1, AVT2 (desi, Kabuli, rain-fed, late sown) against wilt and dry root rot disease was undertaken as per assigned technical program. Salient highlights of the observations and achievements include the following: • Chickpea wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. ciceri) and Dry root rot (Rhizoctonia bataticola) as the prominent diseases of chick-pea in the Bundelkhand region. ♦ 92 entries exhibited incidence of wilt of 70% and above – of which 19 entries were in the range of 80-95% of wilt incidence. ♦ 14 entries exhibited low incidence of wilt being below 20% ♦ 59 entries exhibited the incidence of root rot in the range of 60-95%. ♦ 16 entries exhibited low incidence of root rot being below 20%. • The wilt disease was present at almost all the villages of Jhansi district. The disease incidence ranged from 20 to 35%. • Collar rot (Sclerotium rolfsii) in the seedling stage under wet soil conditions. The incidence of the disease was more at higher soil moisture and at sowing time temperature of around 28-30°C. • The pathogen was isolated on potato dextrose agar using recommended technique. • The morphological and cultural characteristics of isolated pathogen were identified by the naked eyes and with the help of microscope. • Development of isolated wilt sick plot and sick plot for dry root rot to have optimum inoculums load of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Ciceris and also Rhizoctonia bataticola, respectively. • The results need further confirmation on disease reaction.
