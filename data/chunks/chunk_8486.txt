 Crop Production In oats, sulphur in soil at 60 kg/ha and recommended NPK (90 : 60 : 30 kg/ha) enhanced maximum forage yield to 50.6%, compared to control (14.87 tonnes/ha). Butachlor at 2.0 kg a.i./ha (pre-emergence) to berseem produced higher forage yield (31.0%) than control (49.1 tonnes/ha) and also controlled Cichorium intybus and other weeds, Chenopodium, Anagallis and Asphodelus, effectively. In coconut plantation, recommended NPK(150 : 50 : 50 kg/ha) + Glyricidia leaves at 5 tonnes/ha to Congosignal grass (Brachiaria ruziziensis) have been beneficial; increased forage yield (39.21 tonnes/ha) over 100% recommended dose of NPK + FYM at 5 tonnes/ha. Paddy-cowpea (F) - oats (F) sequence has provided significantly higher (49%) net monetary returns (Rs 3,876.0/ha/yr) over paddy-sorghum (F) - oats (F). With curtailed doses of recommended fertilizers (75%) + FYM at 5 tonnes/ha to both the sequences higher rice equivalent yield (3.87 tonnes/ha) was obtained than full recommended doses of fertilizer (NPK 60 : 30 : 20 kg/ha for paddy, 60 : 30 : 0 kg/ ha for sorghum forage, 20 : 40 : 0 kg/ha for cowpea forage and 40 : 20 : 20 kg/ha for oats). To oats in saline sodic soils, 75% recommended dose of nitrogen + 25% nitrogen through FYM + 40 kg ZnSO4/ha enhanced forage yield to 19.3% over full dose of NPK (90 : 50: 40 kg/ha); when the yield was 27.4 tonnes/ha. ANIMAL FEED-BLOCK MAKING MACHINE DEVELOPED This machine is capable of making blocks with all kinds of straws and grasses. Its overall dimensions are 3.40 m × 2.70 m × 1.81 m, and its output capacity is 30–40 blocks per hour. The bulk density of the common roughage based feed-blocks prepared from this machine can be increased to 6– 10 times. Due to higher bulk density of blocks, these require much less storage space as well as lower handling and transportation cost. CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 27 In coconut plantation, fodder cowpea provided 55% higher net monetary returns over fodder pigeonpea (Rs 8,873/ha/yr). Nitrogen 50% through vermicompost and the rest through fertilizer, realized maximum net monetary returns (Rs17,832.50/ ha/yr). The inoculation of Azospirillum to sorghum increased green fodder and dry matter yield to the magnitude of 19.3 and 27.1%; with Azotobacter inoculation, it was 6.7% and 5.6%. In maize, increases to the tune of 10 and 20% for green fodder and dry matter yield were recorded with Azotobacter inoculation. Maize and cowpea in the row ratio of 2 : 2 in Central Zone, 1 : 1 and 1 : 4 in the North-east Zone, maize sole and maize + cowpea (4 : 1) in South Zone and sole maize in North-west Zone recorded higher forage yields. Maximum fodder production from Congosignal grass could be achieved with FYM at 7.5 tonnes/ha and 50% NPK (75 kg N + 25 kg P2O5 + 25 kg K2O/ha), accompanied with the irrigation at 30 mm CPE. KNO3 spray at 4 kg/ha has been found beneficial for obtaining higher seed and forage yields from signal grass in coconut plantation in the southern zone.
