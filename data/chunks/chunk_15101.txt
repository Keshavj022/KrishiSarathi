 Self-reported production differences within these overlapping subsamples eliminate selection bias and isolate the direct effect of survey mode on the same household or individual responding to the same question over different media.5 We first discuss the effect of survey mode on responses given by the same individual. The left column of Fig. 2 compares differences between survey modes at each decile among those who responded to both surveys against differences across the full sample of respondents. The solid lines plot the production gap between survey modes at each decile in the full sample, reproducing results from Fig. 1, and reflect the net effect of both survey mode and differential selection. The dotted lines represent the production gap in the sample of overlapping respondents, which is only directly affected by survey mode. For all four main pulse varieties, the production gap at each decile in the overlapping sample closely tracks that of the full sample. The largest deviations occur around the 60th to 80th percentiles of green peas and fava beans, and production reported in person actually ex- ceeds that by phone at the 80th percentile for green peas. Other than this discrepancy, the gap between in-person and phone surveys that appears among the set of respondents who answered both surveys is of similar sign and magnitude to the difference in the full sample throughout the distribution of responses. Comparing means across the subset of overlapping respondents con- firms survey mode effects, rather than selective attrition, generate most of the measured production gap. For three out of four crops – pigeon pea, red lentil, and green pea – the within-respondent survey mode 5 In Appendix A we show results are not influenced by differences in survey timing.
