In India, the potato sector witnessed rapid growth during last seven decades as a direct consequence of strong R&D support extended by ICAR-Central Potato Research Institute, Shimla. For example, total potato production in India increased from 34.7 million tonnes in the year 2008 when the second global potato conference was held in New Delhi, India to 53 million tonnes now; an increase of almost 53% in 10 years. Moreover, the sector is expected to grow at about 3% annual compounded growth rate in India by 2050. However, shifting economic status and aspiration of people of India as well as emerging global food market are casting inevitable influence on R&D orientation. The changing global climate and agricultural landscape also necessitate continuous fine-tuning of ways and means to achieve desired quality and productivity in sustainable manner through eco-friendly and climate smart technologies. It is therefore necessary to deliberate on the decadal achievements in potato sector and to set up a roadmap for forthcoming decade. In this direction, during last two decades two Global Potato Conferences were organized during 1999, and 2008.
