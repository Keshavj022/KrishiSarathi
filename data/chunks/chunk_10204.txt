 The other important projects completed during the British rule were Sirhind Canal, Lower Sohag and Para Canals, Lower Chenab Canal and the Sidhnai Canal in Punjab; Lower Ganga Canal, Agra Canal and the Betwa Canal in Uttar Pradesh; the Periyar System of Canals in Madras; the Mutha Canals in Maharashtra, Jamrao and Western Nara Canals in Sind (now in Pakistan), the Periyar Dam in Tamil Nadu (1887) and the Nira Canals (1877-1894) (Rangachari et al. 2012). The important irrigation projects completed before independence are given in Table 3. It is well-accepted that the country needs to go with ancient as well as modern systems of rainwater harvesting and irrigation system for meeting the need of agriculture and other sectors in the emerging era of water shortage and changing climate.

Ancient and Middle Ages There are repeated references of soil and its management practices in the Vedic texts (Table 4). The ‘Hymns to Goddess Earth’ in the Atharva Veda provide excellent reference to earth and soil and their connects to the individual and society. It highlights that soil is not a commodity but a part of our living community: ‘The earth that supports all, furnishes wealth, the foundation, the golden-breasted resting-place of all living creatures ….”. In the Vedic period farmers used to plough the soil, broadcast the seeds and used a certain sequence of cropping and fallowing. Cow dung was used for fertilizer (Anonymous 2012). The Indus Valley Civilization provides evidence of an animal-drawn plough dating back to 2500 BCE (Lal 2001). The Mauryan Empire (322-185 BCE) categorized soils and made meteorological observations for agricultural use. They also constructed dams and had horse-drawn chariots, which are quicker than common bullock carts (Anonymous 2008). Megasthenes, the Greek diplomat (c. 300 BC), in his book Indika, observed, “India has many huge mountains which abound in fruit-trees of every kind and many vast plains of great fertility. The greater part of the soil, moreover, is under irrigation, and consequently bears two crops in the course of the year. Since there are two monsoons in each year, the inhabitants of India almost always gather in two harvests annually”. Importance of organic manure has been mentioned in the Rig and Atharva Vedas.
