 (e) The mineral content in juice extracted from banana pseudostem was estimated using atomic absorption spectrophoto- meter. (f) Collection of fish samples for growth studies: The net was cast randomly to collect fish from pond. The length and weight of fish were recorded and then released into pond. Average values of length and weight were obtained by dividing by total number of fish. Laboratory experiment The laboratory study was carried out in two parts, i.e. indoor experiment (28 days) and out door experiment (90 days) during 2004, the details of which are furnished in Table 1. The pH of water samples was measured on the spot following the electrometric method by using a pH pen and was confirmed again in the laboratory with a digital pH meter (Systronics: Model No. MK-VI). Total alkalinity, total hardness, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, calcium and ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) were estimated following APHA (1995) method. Nitrate nitrogen (N03-N) content of water was estimated following the spectrophotometric method (Stikcland and Parson, 1960). The plankton samples were examined under research microscope for qualitative and quantitative analyses following drop method (Battish, 1992). Tannin content in juice was estimated by volumetric method. The trace mineral contents in juice like that of Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Mg and Ca was estimated using Atomic absorption spectrophoto-meter (Model: Perkin Elmer, A Analyst-100) after digesting the sample with nitric acid. Total tannin was estimated by APHA, (1995). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The efficacy of banana pseudostem in improving pond water quality and enhancing growth of fish was determined through field experimentation conducted during 2002-03 at Bastar village of Balasore district of Orissa, whose results were published in Document 3 of the project. Results of the controlled studies conducted during 2003- 04 are presented here. Chemical characteristics of juice extracted from banana pseudostem The quantity of juice extracted from banana pseudostem was 700 ml/kg. The juice was yellowish brown in colour and slightly acidic (pH= 6.2). It contained 12.47 g/litre total tannin, 2.47 mg/litre Fe, 0.82 mg/litre Zn, 0.816 mg/litre Mn, 89.4 mg/litre Ca, 0.74 mg/litre Cu and 25.8 mg/litre Mg. Total alkalinity and hardness of the extracted juice were 1720 and 798 mg/litre respectively (Table 2). pH of experimental water In the case of indoor experiment, the pH values Contents FISHERY Table 1. Details of variables in different treatments in indoor and outdoor study in control (To) varied between 6.06 ±0.1 and 7.10 ± 0.0; whereas in lime treatment (T4) it varied in the range of 7.57 ± 0.06 to 7.43 ± 0.12 and similar variations were observed in different treatments of banana pseudostem juice (T1, T2 and T3) (Table 2a). In case of out door experiment the pH values varied from 7.10 to 7.73 in control whereas in lime treatment it varied from 7.50 to 8.
