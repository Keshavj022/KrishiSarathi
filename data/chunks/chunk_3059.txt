 RT‐PCR (oligoprobing) ELISA and dot hybridization assay showed 1000‐ and 10‐fold greater sensitivity than the sandwich ELISA, respectively. • Diagnostic Kits and reagents for FMDV detection (for testing 1,25,000 tissue samples) and for seromonitoring under FMD control program were produced, optimized, evaluated and supplied to different units/centers on a routine basis. • A trained work force of 60 persons for undertaking FMD diagnosis and seromonitoring was created across the country. 20 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Animal Sciences www.icar.org.in Network Project on Bluetongue 1.

Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): ♦ Sixteen bluetongue virus isolates of types 1, 2, 9, 15, 18 and 23 from different sources were utilized as virus repository. ♦ No outbreak of bluetongue was reported in north India except in Southern States like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. ♦ Varying percentage of seroprevalence of BT has been recorded in different species of livestocks. ♦ One monoclonal antibody produced against BTV has potential for developing sandwich/competitive ELISA and BTV r‐Ag based indirect ELISA for detection of BT antibodies has been developed and evaluated using more than thousand sera. In addition, typing facility developed to type the virus indigenously. ♦ BTV vaccine using BEI inactivated bluetongue virus serotype 1 adjuvanted with saponin or seppic oil yielded promising results in local and Bharat Merino breeds of sheep. ♦ Samples of midges from different parts of the country were identified as C. oxystoma, C. clavipalpis, C. actoni, C. anophelis, C. orientalis, C. similis and C. imicola.. ♦ Type specific primer designing for typing of new isolates of BTV, development of multiplex RT‐PCR for differential diagnosis of BTV and PPRV, RNA‐PAGE of the isolates, nucleotide sequence studies to determine the relationship of Indian isolates with other global isolates have been done. It has been found that BTV‐2 isolate from Hyderabad is more closely related to European and Chinese isolate than to American isolate. Homology among Indian and Australian isolates ranged from 95.7% to 99.4 %. Indian BTV types are closely related to each other forming monophyletic group ♦ VP7 gene was amplified, cloned, expressed in PET 32a and identity was confirmed by SDS‐PAGE and western blotting. ♦ Recombinant antigen reacted well with antibodies against 10 serotypes of BTV namely, BTV‐1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 14, 15, 22 and 23. www.icar.org.in 21 2002 ‐ 2007 Network Project on Gastro‐Intestinal Parasitism 1.
