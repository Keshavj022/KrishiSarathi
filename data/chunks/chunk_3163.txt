  Use tolerant variety 48‐1 (Jwala)  Adopt wider spacing (90 x 60 cm) between rows.  Give prophylactic spray with carbendazim or thiophanate methyl 1 g/l and one more spray soon after disease appearance.  Prophylactic spray with T.viride + Pseudomonas fluoresencs 3 g/l.  Remove infected spikes/capsules & destroy.  Top dress with Urea 20 kg/ha after cessation of rains for the formation of new spikes. Cladosporium capsule rot (Cladosporium oxysporum Berk and Cart.) Dark green lesions develop towards the base of the capsules at the time of maturity, particularly when the capsules start developing cracks/fissures. Capsules rot, shrivel; depress and turn olive black. Infection spreads to the inner sides the seeds exhibiting blackish green sooty growth.  Spray Dithane‐Z‐78 or mancozeb. Harvest at right time when the spikes turn lemon yellow. www.icar.org.in 27 2002 ‐ 2007 All India Coordinated Research Project on Chickpea 1.
