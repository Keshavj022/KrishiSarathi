   Apply 25 kg magnesium sulphate as basal dose at the time of sowing for higher yield. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 12   For good crop establishment and early growth, soak the cotton seed in a solution of 0.5 g succinic acid in 5 litres of water for 2-4 hours for acid delinted seed or 6-8 hours for non- delinted seed. To prevent attach of jassid at early stage, smear the seed with 5 g Gaucho 70 WS (imidacloprid) or 7 g Cruiser 30FS (thiomethoxam) per kg seed. To remove the fuzz of non- delinted seed, rub these seeds with fine earth, cow-dung or ash.   Sow the seeds with cotton sowing drill or cotton planter with line to line spacing of 67.5 cm. Maintain plant to plant distance of 45 cm for variety PAU Bt 1 and desi cotton varieties, 60 cm for all other varieties, 75 cm for Bt and non Bt hybrids and 15 cm for variety F 2383 by thinning out extra plants after first irrigation. If plant population is less due to fewer germination and burning of seedlings at early stage, do gap filling with 3 weeks old nursery grown in 4”x6”polythene bags, filled with 1:1 mixture of soil and FYM.   For utilization of inter row spacing of cotton, grow one row of maize or cowpea in between two rows of cotton. Take one harvest of maize/cowpea fodder at 45-55 days after sowing.   For the control of weeds, give need based 2-3 hoeing with tractor mounted cultivator/ tractor operated rotary weeder/triphali or wheel hand hoe. Avoid their use after fruiting.   Apply urea 162.5 kg to non-Bt varieties, 200 kg to Bt variety (PAU Bt 1) and 225 kg to all Bt and non- Bt hybrids, DAP 67.5 kg or SSP 187.5 kg per ha. Omit phosphorus (DAP or SSP) application to cotton when it follows wheat which had received recommended dose of phosphorus. Reduce the dose of urea by 25 kg when 67.5 kg DAP is applied to cotton. Apply 50 kg muriate of potash and 25 kg zinc sulphate heptahydrate (21%) or 16.25 kg zinc sulphate monohydrate (33%) per ha to cotton in light soils. Apply full dose of phosphorus, muriate of potash and zinc at sowing. Apply urea in two splits at thinning and the appearance of flowers. In light soils apply the first dose of nitrogen at sowing instead of at thinning.   Apply 1.0 kg boron (10 kg borax) per ha at sowing to boron deficient (<0.5 kg available boron) calcareous soils having 2% or more calcium carbonate. Avoid indiscriminately use of boron, as excessive boron use may cause toxicity.   Cotton is very sensitive to water. Give first irrigation at 4 to 6 weeks after sowing and subsequently at two- or three-weeks interval depending upon soil type and weather conditions. There should not be any water stress at flowering and fruiting stages. Adopt drip irrigation for higher yield and water saving. In soils irrigated with sodic water (RSC > 2.5 meq/L), treat seed with the liquid bioformulations (Azo+PSB+ZnSB) along with gypsum (25% GR) application.
