 Highest important value index during summer and winter seasons was recorded in Echinochloa colona (55.90%) and Avena ludoviciana (76.99%), respec- tively. Higher Shannon Wiener index and Evenness were recorded for CT+HW-CT+HW (1.83, 0.91) and ZT +IWM-ZTR+IWM (1.73, 0.86) which indicate higher weed species diversity during summer and winter seasons, respectively. ZTR-ZTR led to less diverse weed diversity compared to intensive conventional til- lage (CT-CT) practices. However, higher Simpson’s diversity was recorded for CT+HW-CT+HW, i.e. 0.83 and 0.82 for maize and wheat, respectively, compared to the other conventional tillage treatments.

Introduction Intensive tillage, skewed pesticides application and outrageous irrigation may cause degradation of soil, water and environment and led to serious upheavals (Penescu et al., 2001). Crop-weed competition for light, space, nutrients and water reduce the pro- ductivity and quality of the produce (Soltani et al., 2018). Although, farmers take up various weed management strategies to curtail the reduction of crop produce (Zhang and Wu, 2021). Yet, farmers are currently concentrating their usage of chemical herbicides on sup- pressing a variety of weed ﬂora, which has resulted in a severe problem with weed herbicide resistance and environmental risks (Gu et al., 2019). Agronomic exercises such as crop rotation, tillage (Baghel et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2018), residue retention (Price et al.
