 The new salt tolerant varieties in rice (CSR 76) and mustard (CS 61 and CS 62) developed. Mechanization and Energy Management: A tractor operated side trencher was developed to make trench up to 300 mm depth. The effective field capacity and field efficiency of the trencher were 0.2 ha/h and 71%, respectively when operated to dig a trench of 300 mm deep in 3 m wide vineyard at 2.0 km/h forward speed. The cost of operation of tractor operated side trencher is about ₹ 560/hr. It economizes the cost of operation, labour and time by 72, 94 and 80%, respectively as compared to manual digging of trench with hand tools. The tractor operated FYM applicator of 1 tonne capacity developed for placing FYM near the plant. The cost of operation of tractor operated FYM applicator is about ₹ 645/hr which saves labour, time and cost of operation by 98, 80 and 88%, respectively as compared to manual method. Manual operations of raised bed forming, drip lateral and plastic mulch laying, and planting seeds in a plastic mulch requires about 29 man-days/ha. A tractor operated drip lateral and plastic mulch layer-cum-planter has been developed to perform raised bed formation, drip lateral and plastic mulch laying etc in single pass of the tractor. The total cost of equipment is ₹3,00,000 with operational cost of ₹ 1,500/hr. The payback period of equipment is 1.9 years. A self-propelled walk-behind maize harvester for snapping the maize cobs from the maize plants and simultaneously cutting the plants has been developed. The effective field capacity of the harvester is 0.2 ha/ hr and the cost of operation of the maize harvester is ₹ 2,850/ha. The saving in cost of operation, time and labour are 25, 96 and 91%, respectively compared to manual harvesting. A remote-controlled electronic system has been developed for ride-on rice transplanter to reduce human drudgery. It can be remotely operated at a distance of 200 m. The field capacity of remote- controlled ride-on rice transplanter is 0.24 ha/hr. To ease the digging of garlic, a tractor operated harvester has been developed which can harvest garlic crop planted on raised beds. The harvesting efficiency of the harvester is 97% and bulb damage is <0.5%. A small tractor-mounted hydraulic pruner for orchards has been developed with the pruning capacity of 120 plants/hr. The cost and operating cost of the pruner is ₹ 4,50,000 and ₹ 4,910/ha, respectively. ICAR-CIAE has developed a low-cost SPAD meter 2.0. It measures SPAD values for crops such as rice, wheat, maize, etc. with leaves up to 1 mm thickness. The SPAD values, measured with the device, can be used to generate recommendations for top-dressing of nitrogen fertilizer dose. A small tractor operated boom sprayer has been developed for orchard crops. The cost of the spraying system is ₹ 30,000. The discharge rate of boom sprayer was 608 l/hr at 0.3 MPa pressure. The application rate and turning time of the spraying system was 475 l/ha and 12 s, respectively.
