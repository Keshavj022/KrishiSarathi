 It is imperative to disseminate information regarding the availability of these seeds to other farmers through channels such as newspapers, brochures, posters, and social media, leveraging the power of free advertisements within the farming community. Additionally, on-site delivery services can be extended if farmers acquire at least 2,000 seeds or more, particularly within the same district. Agriculture magazines can serve as effective platforms for promoting this news, and farmers are encouraged to explore innovative methods for marketing their produce at a premium price, bypassing intermediaries. The successful buy-back arrangements and marketing models demonstrated by ICAR-KVK Ernakulam in the Ernakulam region are viable examples supporting agencies can adopt. SUMMARY The innovative pond system approach for pearlspot seed production, introduced by ICAR-KVK, Ernakulam, emerges as a promising solution to bridge the gap between demand and supply. Overcoming challenges like low fecundity and intricate breeding behaviours, this method offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional hatchery systems. The emphasis on water quality management, predator control, and efficient harvesting techniques contributes to the success of sustainable pearlspot aquaculture. The economic feasibility and marketing strategies presented provide valuable insights for farmers, ensuring optimal seed production and dissemination in the market. *Corresponding author email: vikaspattath@gmail.com March 2024 13 Indian Farming 74 March 2024 Eco-friendly management of pests and diseases in small cardamom Sudhakar Soundarajan1*, Preethu K Paul1, Ashiba A1, R Marimuthu1, S N Sushil2, G Sivakumar2, T Venkatesan2, M Nagesh2, V Venkatasubramanian3 and B T Rayudu3 1ICAR-Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Idukki, Kerala 685 619 2ICAR-National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560 024 3ICAR-Agricultural Technology Application Research Institute, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560 024 Small cardamom, known as 'green gold', symbolizes India's prominence in the global spice market, originating from the Western Ghats Forest in southern India. Over time, environmental changes in this region have led to indiscriminate use of synthetic chemical pesticides by farmers, resulting in environmental degradation and high pesticide residue levels in produce. As focus shifts towards organic small cardamom production, the search for safer pest and disease management measures becomes crucial. ICAR-National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (NBAIR), Bengaluru, has developed various bio-agents effective for eco-friendly management of major cardamom pests and diseases. In the last five years, ICAR-KVK, Idukki, has extensively disseminated these technologies among small cardamom farmers through various activities, leading to increased adoption of eco- friendly practices, reduced pesticide usage, improved crop health, and sustainable production.
