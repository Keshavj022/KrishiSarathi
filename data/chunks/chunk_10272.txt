The well-designed research programs and concerted scientific efforts have made it possible for animal sector to touch the new horizons. The development of high yielding crosses of different livestock species viz. cattle (4), sheep (5), pig (9), chicken (6), Japanese quail (6), Guinea fowl (3) and turkey (2) have played pivotal role in augmenting animal production. Molecular genetics approaches have helped in pathways analysis and identification of gene(s) related to production/disease resistance traits.
