 Plant perennial grasses like Napier bajra hybrid, Setaria and Guinea grass in waste lands or field bunds in the month of July-August or February- March. These grasses provide nutritious green fodder (16-20 quintals per Kanal) in 3-4 cuttings. Silage provides nutritious alternative when there is scarcity of fodder particularly in the months of October-December and April â€“June and maintains the milk production. Prepare silage in Kharif and Rabi season. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 25 Supplement the diet of dairy animals with Urea Molasses Mineral blocks. These blocks are cheap source of energy, protein, and minerals. Keep the block for licking (10-15 minutes) at the time of milking in morning and evening. Grow Azolla round the year as it is a nutritive and cheap organic feed substitute for dairy cattle. It provides high quality protein and micro minerals like selenium and zinc. Cost of feeding can be reduced by including azolla in animal diet thus making dairy farming more profitable. Provide balanced concentrate ration @ 1 kg per 3 L of milk production+ 1 kg for maintenance per day. Prepare balanced concentrate ration by using 40% cereal, 30% oil cake, 27% wheat bran, 2% mineral mixture and 1% salt. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 26 PUNJAB Wheat Improved varieties Timely Sown Irrigated Conditions: Unnat PBW 343, Unnat PBW 550, PBW 1 Zn, PBW 725, PBW 677, HD 3086, WH 1105, HD 2967, PBW 621, WHD 943 and PDW 291 Late Sown Irrigated Conditions: PBW 752 and PBW 658 Time of Sowing: First fortnight of November is the optimum sowing time of wheat crop. However, sowing of long duration varieties can be commenced from the fourth week of October. Seed Rate: 45 kg per acre for Unnat PBW 550 and 40 kg for all other varieties. Seed Treatment For Termite: In termite infested soil, treat the seed with 1 g Cruiser 70 WS (thiamethoxam) or 2 ml Neonix 20 FS (imidacloprid+hexaconazole) or 4 ml Dursban/Ruban/Durmet 20 EC (chlorpyriphos) per kg seed and dry it in shade. Seed treated with Neonix also control smuts of wheat. For Loose Smut: Treat 40 kg seed with 13 ml Raxil Easy/Orius 6 FS (tebuconazole) by dissolving in 400 ml water or 120 g Vitavax Power 75 WS (carboxin+tetramethyl thiurum disulphide) Seed Inoculation: Inoculate recommended quantity of seed for one acre with 500 g consortium or 250 g each of Azotobacter and Streptomyces (Azo-S) biofertilizer and one litre of water on pucca floor. Sowing Method and Spacing Conventional Sowing: Sow wheat with a seed-cum-fertilizer drill at a depth of 4-6 cm. A spacing of 15-20 cm between the rows gives good yield. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 27 Bi-directional Sowing: In this method use half the recommended quantities of seed and fertilizer for sowing in one direction and the remaining half in the other direction (across the first direction). Raised Bed Sowing: With the help of bed planter, using 30 kg seed per acre, two rows of wheat can be sown 20 cm apart on 37.
