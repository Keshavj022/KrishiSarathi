 COLDWATER AQUACULTURE Trout Culture at Champawat Experiments were conducted to rear rainbow trout Onchorhynchus mykiss in the warmer agro-climatic conditions, where for nearly ten months the minimum water temperature remains above 10°C and the maximum ranges between 20-22°C, even the pH values always range between 8.0 to 8.2 and lower levels of dissolved oxygen drop to 5.0 ppm. The water quality was uncongenial for trout farming. The water quality was monitored and scientific package of practices for farming of rainbrow trout was adopted. The result was very encouraging and the fishes attained the table size in the warmer agro-climatic condition of Champawat. These prized fishes were sold to the local people. This has opened up a great opportunity to local people to take up the trout farming which commands high price and has good demand in big metropolitan cities. Cage Culture of Mahseer in Reservoir Cage culture experiment for culture of mahseer has been conducted in the Walwan reservoir. The nylon cages (2 to 5 mm and 2 to 15 mm) were stocked with commercially important mahseer at a depth of 2 metre in the reservoir. Encouraging results were obtained and after 150 days of culture the average net weight of Tor khudree increased from 35.2 g to 106 g and the average net weight of Tor putitora from 14.6 g to 52.4 g. The rate of survival of mahseer in these cages were approximately 98%. BRACKISHWATER AQUACULTURE Polyculture of Brackishwater Finfishes and Shellfishes A polyculture experiment with stocking density of 38,800 nos./ha (mullet 16,000; pearlspot 3,800; P indicus 12,000; P. monodon 12,000), was carried out in a 0.05 ha. perennial tide-fed pond at the Narakkal. A total quantity of 78.2 kg of fish and shrimp was harvested at the end of a culture duration of 6 months for fishes and 3-4 months BREEDING ENDANGERED FISHES Induced breeding was successfully achieved in three endangered and food fishes namely Horabagrus bachysoma, Labeo dussumieri and Ompok malabaricus. Two prioritised ornamental species of Western Ghats namely Danio malabaricus and Puntius melanmpyx were successfully bred in captivity. Breeding technique for H. brachysoma and O. malabaricus were standardized for the first time in the country. Experimental cages in Walwan reservoir Stocking of cage in progress DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 128 for shrimps. The total production rate works out to 1,564 kg/ha. From an initial size of 25 mm/0.16 g for mullets, M. cephalus reached 250 mm/155 g and L. parsia 162 mm/36 g. E. suratensis attained 178 mm/134 g from an initial size of 58 mm/ 8 g. In the case of shrimp, PL20 reached a size of 152 mm/29 g for P. monodon and 101 mm/5 g for P. indicus. MARICULTURE Seed Production of Sea Cucumber A breakthrough has been achieved in the seed production and larval rearing of sea cucumber Holothuria spinifera for the first time in the hatchery by Tuticorin Centre of CMFRI, Cochin.
