Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years): Lessons Learnt from Long Term Fertilizer Experiments and Measures to Sustain Productivity in Alfisols • Alfisols are highly leached soils with poor buffering capacity occurring under high rainfall area. Out of 17 sites of LTFE, four sites belong to Alfisols viz. Palampur, Ranchi Bangalore and Pattambi. Experiment at Pattambi is laid out in second phase during 1996‐97. In last three decades, enormous information was generated from LTFE. In this publications, attempts are made to highlight the important findings emerged out of the experiments of Alfisols, which could be used to develop the strategies to tackle the sustainability issue in Alfisols. The experiments are continued since 1971 with the following treatments in Alfisols. The details of treatments and nutrient doses and cropping sequence and soil type are described in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Table 1.
