8, electrical conduc­ tivity (EC) of 0.32 dS m−1, and KMnO4 oxidizable N of 158.4 kg ha−1. The location experiences a semi-arid climate, receiving an average annual rainfall of 650 mm, with 70–80 % occurring during the kharif/ rainy season. The experiment encompasses three distinct tillage and crop establishment methods: (I) Conservation agriculture (CA)-based Bed Planting (PB), (II) CA-based Zero Tillage Flat (ZT), and (III) Con­ ventional Tillage (CT), all under four diversified cropping systems, namely MWMb, kharif/rainy season maize (Zea mays L.)-winter/rabi season wheat (Triticum aestivum)-summer season mungbean (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek); MCS, kharif/rainy season maize – winter/rabi season chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)- summer season Sesbaina (Sesbania accu­ lata); MMuMb, kharif/rainy season maize- winter/rabi season mustard (Brassica juncea)- summer season mungbean; MMS, kharif/rainy season maize- winter/rabi season maize- summer season Sesbania. The experi­ ment was conducted using a split plot design, with three tillage practices in the main plots and four diversified cropping systems in the sub-plots, replicated three times. 2.2. Tillage and crop establishment methods, crop cultivar, and fertilizer use For zero tillage (ZT) plots, a ZT planter with inverted ‘T’ tynes was used for planting with surface retained residue. Bed planting was carried out on a 37 cm wide flat top beds with a furrow depth of 15 cm and mid- furrow to mid-furrow distance of 67 cm. Beds were reshaped annually. The quality protein maize variety HQPM1 was sown until the kharif season of 2016, after which the PMH1 variety, with similar duration and yield potential, was adopted. In the rabi/winter season, the mustard cultivar Pusa Bold was initially used for three years and was subse­ quently replaced by NRCDR-2 until 2017. From then on, PM-30 was sown, with a seed rate of 5 kg ha−1. The chickpea cultivar P 362 was used for the first three years, succeeded by the Pusa 547 cultivar, sown in the last week of October at a seed rate of 80 kg ha−1. The wheat cultivar PBW 343 was replaced by HD 2967 after the initial five years H.S. Nayak et al. European Journal of Agronomy 162 (2025) 127436 2 and was sown in the second or 1st fortnight of November with a seed rate of 100 kg ha−1. During the summer season, Pusa Vishal mungbean cultivar was planted for the first nine years, followed by the Samrat cultivar with a seed rate of 25 kg ha−1 in MWMb and MMuMb systems. In MCS and MMS systems, a local cultivar of Sesbania was grown as green manure. Kharif/rainy season maize was sown in the first fortnight of July each year. Rainy season maize received a nitrogen dose of 150 kg ha−1, 60 kg P2O5, and 40 kg K2O ha−1, while slightly higher doses were applied for rabi/winter maize, i.e., 180 kg N, 80 kg P2O5, and 60 kg K2O ha−1.
