 Eight taxa were recorded for the first time from India and there were 32 new regional distribution records within India, 62 new host plant/new host insect recordsâ€‹ and molecular characterization and DNA barcoding has been done for 50 agriculturally important insects. New species of parasitoids: Two new species of parasitoid wasps, Pambolus (Phaenodus) infuscatus (Braconidae: Pambolinae) and Paroplitis khajjiarensis) (Braconidae: Microgastrinae) were described and illustrated from Himachal Pradesh, India. A key to the Oriental species of Pambolus and an updated key to the world species of Paroplitis were provided. Additionally, Centistes (Centistes) cuspidatus (Braconidae: Euphorinae) was reported for the first time from the Indian geographical boundaries.
