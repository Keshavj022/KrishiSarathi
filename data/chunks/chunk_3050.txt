Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): A. Phenotypic Characterization & development of Breed Descriptors of Animal Genetic Resources (24 breeds) A set of twelve breeds of livestock and poultry were taken for the phenotypic characterization through survey during IXth Five year Plan. These units completed their technical programmes during first year of Xth Plan. The breed descriptors of all theses breeds were discussed in the 7th Scientists’ meet at NBAGR, Karnal. These breeds are as follows as: • Bachaur cattle • Dangi cattle • Amritmahal cattle • Nagpuri buffalo • Changthangi sheep • Deccani sheep • Mecheri sheep • Attapaddy goat • Arunachali mithun • Spiti horse • Kutchi camel • Ankleshwar poultry Another set of twelve breeds was taken up for the phenotypic characterization through survey during Xth plan. The Breed Descriptors and Monographs of these breed were published. These breeds are as follows as: • Khillar cattle • Gangatiri cattle • Gaolao cattle 4 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Animal Sciences www.icar.org.in • Tho Tho cattle • Surti Buffalo • Mandya sheep • Chhotanagpuri sheep • Coimbatore sheep • Banpala sheep • Rampur Bushair sheep • Mehsana goat • Ganjam goat B.
