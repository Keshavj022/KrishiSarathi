Cereals: Among cereal crops, 10,684 FLDs were conducted on 5,886 technology options of wheat varieties and management technologies in 3,518 ha area by 284 KVKs. The Average yield in the demonstrations was 12.0% higher than the farmer’s practice. A total of 3,963 varietal and technology options were demonstrated in 13,443 FLDs in 4,968.1 ha area on rice varieties and technologies by 394 KVKs in which the average yield in demonstration was 21% higher than the farmer’s practice. On maize varieties and technologies, 142 KVKs conducted 3,344 FLDs on 902 varietal and technology options in 1,165.1 ha area wherein the yield increase was 17% in the demonstrations over farmers’ practice. Demonstrations (1,096) were also conducted on barley and oats in 577.44 ha area. Thus, 28,567 FLDs on different cereals were conducted in 10,228.64 ha area. Millets: In all, 2,943 FLDs on different millets were conducted in 838.20 ha area. Among the millets, the highest number of 453 varietal and technology options were demonstrated on finger millet by 45 KVKs in 1,251 FLDs wherein the average yield was 29% higher than the farmer’s practice. Varieties and technologies on pearl millet (153) and barnyard millet (196) in 588 and 214 FLDs showed 25 and 26% higher average yield, respectively, than farmers’ practice. Pulses (other than CFLDs): Among 10,608 FLDs on 1,783 varietal and production technologies on pulses in 3,378.71 ha area, 2,729 FLDs were on chickpea (24% higher average yield than farmers’ practice), 1,471 FLDs on green gram (30% higher average yield than farmers’ practice), 234 on rajmah (35% higher average yield than farmers’ practice), and 1,933 were on blackgram (33% higher average yield than farmers’ practice). Oilseeds (other than CFLDs): Out of a total of 14,913 FLDs on oilseed crops in 4,474.71 ha area, 7,742 FLDs were conducted on 2,421 varieties and management technologies of mustard, brown sarson, gobhi sarson, toria and rapeseed wherein the average yields were 28, 39, 17, 37 and 44% higher than the farmers’ practice, respectively.
