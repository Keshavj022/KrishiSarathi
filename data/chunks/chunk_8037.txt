 Making local adaptation plans as an integral part of local development planning by ensuring the engagement of local government bodies and multiple stakeholders from the respective community, can be considered as an alternate strategy to reduce the climate change adaptation costs. Incorporation of local knowledge and strategies being adopted by the inhabitants in dealing with the climatic aberrations forms a significant supplement to the decision making process both in the district and state level plans since adaptation integration process requires synergy between all the decision making levels. Network Project on Market Intelligence: High price volatility in agricultural commodities and increased risk faced by the farming community necessitate the study of agricultural commodity prices and their behaviour to understand the causes and providing the real time information to the stakeholders. The Network Project on Market Intelligence was carried out to provide reliable and timely price forecasts to farmers for more than 40 major agricultural commodities through a network of 14 institutions throughout the country. More than 180 pre-sowing and 263 pre-harvest price forecasts were disseminated through personal contacts, SMS, television, radio, university websites, pamphlets, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube etc., to the farmers before sowing and during harvests to facilitate informed and intelligent decisions by the farmers. To provide information to the farmers, it is essential that forecast prices turn out to be close to the actual market prices. Forecast accuracy, estimated as the mean absolute percentage error indicates the degree of closeness of the forecasts to the actual market prices and reflects the quality of forecasts. Through innovations in methodological approaches followed, there was greater precision in forecasts overtime; however, horticulture and pulses remained volatile. Potato and onion are extremely sensitive crops in terms of the impact of all external influences to the prices. The pre-harvest forecasts, due to obvious reasons, were more precise than pre-sowing harvests. The impact of price forecasts on the stakeholders was also examined. The forecasts by BHU (Varanasi) Centre revealed that the prices for potato crop were expected to be low during March and high during May 2016 in Uttar Pradesh. This information was efficiently utilized by a few farmers; they stored the crop during March-April and sold it in May, which led to realization of 30-40% higher price by them.
