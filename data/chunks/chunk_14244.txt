 The rice area in the second season is insignificant, therefore only one season of rice crop is considered for calculations. Total consumptive water demand of crops expressed as ET is taken as the crop water demand. Because the overall irrigation system efficiency is 45 % (personal communication with PWD officials), conveyance losses of 55 % were also factored into the irrigation demand calculations. 2.2.2. Future climate data Climate variables are projected using regional climate models. Ten RCMs that project South Asian climate are available at the CORDEX South Asia domain. For our analysis, these datasets were downloaded from the ESGF website https://esg.pik-potsdam.de/ (Table 3). 3. Methods The risk concept as outlined in the IPCC Assessment Report 6 applies for this study. IPCC (2022) defines risk to be the outcome of the inÂ­ teractions among hazards, exposure, vulnerability and response actions (which will be included in the forthcoming publication). Vulnerability in this context encompasses sensitivity and adaptive capacity. This concept has been widely used for vulnerability assessment around the world (Small-Lorenz et al., 2013; Inostroza et al., 2016; Ofori et al., 2017; Swamy and Parthasarathy, 2021). There is no clear delineation between the variables that can be included in these components (Parker et al., 2019). In the context of this study, exposure is defined as changes in climate conditions that will be experienced by the agricultural system. Sensitivity to climate change is expressed in terms of the impacts on Table 2 Location of gauging stations in the study area.
