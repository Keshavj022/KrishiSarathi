 Sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation Dryland horticulture promotes sustainable land management practices that help preserve soil health and prevent land degradation. In many arid regions, overgrazing, deforestation, and unsustainable farming practices have led to soil erosion and loss of fertility. Dryland horticulture counters these challenges by encouraging agroforestry, conservation horticulture, and organic farming techniques. By maintaining ground cover and minimizing soil disturbance, these practices prevent erosion and enhance the long- term productivity of the land. Furthermore, dryland horticulture often focuses on utilizing native or locally adapted crop varieties, which are better suited to the specific environmental conditions of the region. This not only supports biodiversity but also helps farmers work in harmony with their ecosystems, rather than against them. In doing so, it ensures that farming in arid regions is both economically viable and ecologically sustainable. Risk mitigation strategies in dryland horticulture Risk mitigation in dryland horticulture focuses on efficient water management, soil health improvement, and climate-adapted practices. Key strategies include rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation, mulching, and the use of drought-tolerant crop varieties. Conservation tillage, organic matter addition, and cover crops help improve soil moisture retention. Agroforestry, intercropping, and optimized planting schedules further enhance resilience to climate variability. Integrated pest management and crop rotation reduce pest and disease risks, while crop insurance and cooperatives offer financial protection. Access to early warning systems and farmer training also plays a crucial role in adapting to dry conditions. Path forward The potential of dryland horticulture to transform arid lands into profitable hubs is undeniable. However, for this potential to be fully realized, investment in research, infrastructure, and training is essential. Governments, development agencies, and private sector actors all have a role to play in supporting farmers with access to the necessary resources and knowledge to implement water-efficient technologies and sustainable practices. By leveraging the insights from dryland Farm ponds lined with 750 Âµ polythene in Udaipur (Rajasthan) Water conservation under NICRA project at Udaipur Life saving irrigation from harvested rainwater in Udaipur Indian Farming 47 January 2025 horticulture, farmers can turn the challenges of arid environments into opportunities for growth, resilience, and prosperity. With the right support, dryland areas can become not only productive but also profitable, offering a sustainable solution to the growing global demands for food and water. SUMMARY Dryland horticulture is more than just a farming strategy; it is a holistic approach that integrates soil and water conservation, climate adaptation, and sustainable land management.
