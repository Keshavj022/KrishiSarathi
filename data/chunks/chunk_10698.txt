Hybrid) Source: ICAR Annual Report (2020) Indian Farming January 2022 14 Efficient weed management through appropriate herbicides in groundnut R K Singh*, U K Tripathi and Anay Rawat Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya, Jabalpur Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Chhatarpur, Madhya Pradesh 482 004 In groundnut cultivation, several factors cause yield losses, weeds contribute about 40% in yield reduction. Krishi Vigyan Kendra Chhatarpur initiated a systematic and comprehensive effort to solve the most severe weed problem in groundnut cultivation through appropriate weed management. Application of appropriate herbicides i.e. Imazethapyr 10% SL @ 100 g a.i./ha + Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC @ 37.5 g a.i/ha at 15-20 days after sowing along with use of appropriate nozzle and volume of solution. By adopting appropriate herbicide for weed management practices, farmers received higher yield (6.7q/ha) that fetched higher income (` 32,243/ha) due to reduction of weed density (93.6%) as compared to farmers’ practices. Appropriate weed management practices help in efficient utilization of available resources and improve the product quality of groundnut crop. Keywords: Groundnut, Herbicide, Weed management Indian Farming 72(1): 14–15; January 2022 G ROUNDNUT (Glycine max L.) is one of the most important leguminous crops which contains about 44-50% oil and 22% protein. In India, it is cultivated in 39.31 lakh ha area with an annual production of 43.2 lakh MT. Groundnut is not only seen as an oil plant but also used for various purposes and can be grown in diverse environments throughout the world. Despite the high potential for rainfed groundnut production, low productivity is reported in these areas which has been ascribed to crop- weed competition and soil factors.
