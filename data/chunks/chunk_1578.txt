 Future of next generation technologies in rainfed agriculture Next generation technologies continue to evolve and seamless integration of AI & ML, IoT devices and drones will lead to more predictive systems that help farmers make informed decisions with even greater accuracy. Additionally, advancements in cost-effective IoT solutions and better connectivity options will likely increase adoption among smallholder farmers. The future of AI&ML in agriculture may see deeper integration with IoT, blockchain for supply chain transparency, and augmented reality (AR) for training and operational guidance. These technologies can play a larger role in shaping sustainable agricultural policies by providing data that supports eco-friendly practices and sustainable resource management. Machine learning models may evolve to provide customised recommendations tailored specifically to individual farms, taking into account unique conditions and farmer preferences. SUMMARY Next-gen technologies like AI, ML, and drones are revolutionizing rainfed agriculture by addressing challenges such as water scarcity and climate unpredictability. AI aids in weather forecasting, crop monitoring, and decision-making. ML supports data- driven yield prediction, soil and water management, and development of climate-resilient crops. Drones provide aerial surveillance, precision resource application, and damage assessments. These technologies improve efficiency, resilience, and productivity but face hurdles like high costs, training needs, and infrastructure requirements. Despite challenges, their adoption promises significant advancements in sustainability and productivity for rainfed farming. *Corresponding author email: ravi.nakka@icar.gov.in Benefits of next generation technologies in agriculture • Enhanced decision-making: AI&ML provides farmers with data-driven insights with precise strategies that improve crop and livestock management. • Reduced environmental impact: By optimizing the use of resources like water, fertilizers, and pesticides, AI&ML helps reduce pollution and promotes sustainability. • Increased productivity: Automating labour-intensive tasks and applying targeted approaches boost overall productivity and yield. • Real-time data collection: Drones can quickly cover large areas, providing real-time insights into the state of crops and soil. • Cost efficiency: Reduces the need for extensive manual labour and allows for targeted interventions that save resources. • Improved decision-making: High-quality data from drones helps farmers make informed decisions about planting, irrigation, and pest management. • Early warning systems: Timely alerts for adverse weather conditions, pest infestations, or water stress, enable farmers to take preventive measures. • Higher yields: By optimizing planting times and monitoring crop health, farmers can improve yields and reduce losses.
