   Special Agricultural Zones (SAZs) need to be established in the peri-urban and semi- urban areas for fruits, vegetables, milk and egg production focusing on exports and urban areas. Horticulture sector   Reclaiming 5 lakh ha of barren lands within the next two years by encouraging contract farming for horticultural crops (which will improve income levels up to 25% to 40%) and buyback arrangement by the institutional agencies can attract and retain next generation farmers.   Area expansion in date palm, pomegranate, papaya and coconut (hybrid) is possible. But the constraint lies in the growing incidences of drying roots and wilting shoots. The effective strategy could be tissue culture units for date palm and pomegranate plantlets and by establishing plug nurseries for F &Vs & flowers.   South Gujarat has high rainfall & humidity which can be exploited by promoting the cultivation of black pepper, turmeric, ginger, cashewnut and banana. Livestock sector   By Fertility Improvement Programme (FIP) conducted between 2011-12 and 2015-16: 6.95 lakh animals have become fertile. If the average milk yield is 5 Lit./animal/day then total milk production is 34.74 LLPD & additional income is Rs.14 crore /day @Milk price of Rs. 40 / litre.   Thereby, there is an urgent need that FIP programme be implemented across Gujarat through aggressive campaign to reduce NPA besides improving milk availability.   Encourage artificial insemnination with proven bulls.   Establish indigenous milk co-operatives for production and marketing of desi (A2 milk).   Improve fodder production by utilizing proven fodder varieties. E.g. CO (GG)-3 dry State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 169 matter yield of 553.7q/ha/year which was up to 85% higher. Fodder banks need to be encouraged at village level. Fisheries sector   Marine water fish production: Promote cage, pen, seaweed, oyster, and mussel farming policies in marine waters (Except North and Middle Gujarat agro-climatic zones).   Fresh water fish production: Promote cage & pen farming policies in reservoirs and lakes.   Improve fish processing and export infrastructure Processing and Value Addition sector   Cluster based emphasis on HPS groundnut for exports & table purpose in Junagadh, Kutch, Jamnagar, Porbandar and Bhavnagar will enhance farmers’ income up to 25% in 3 years.   Mechanization in production and post-production will reduce per unit cost of production up to 50%.   Roughly, 30% of fruits and vegetable are lost in Gujarat accounting for Rs. 9,000 crores in the state. Processing at least 10% at farm gate level will increase farmers’ income by 15 to 20%.   Cluster based Agro Processing Centre for all crops: Primary processing, grading and milling of produce may increase the market rate by about 10 to 30%.   Not less than 81% cold storages suitable only for Potato. There is a need to upgrade the facilities for multi commodities.
