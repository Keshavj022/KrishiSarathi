 Rainwater harvesting structures are used to collect and store water, which is then used for fisheries and livestock drinking purposes. Watershed Development Department, Karnataka observed increase in fish production by 35% in 3 years through community fish farming in rainwater-harvesting ponds. Fodder availability for livestock improved due to water availability, leading to a 20% rise in milk production. Farmers practicing this system reduced their reliance on external inputs by 25% through efficient water-use and livestock manure recycling. Challenges and opportunities Despite the numerous benefits of livestock and fisheries-based farming systems in rainfed regions, several challenges remain. Water scarcity, land degradation, and limited access to markets and veterinary services are common obstacles faced by farmers. However, interventions such as the promotion of drought-resistant livestock breeds, adoption of rainwater harvesting technologies, and development of community-based fisheries management offer viable solutions. Government programmes like the National Livestock Mission (NLM), Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM), Dairy Processing & Infrastructure Development Fund, National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD) scheme, National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP), Supporting Dairy Cooperatives and Farmer Producer Organizations (SDCFPO) scheme, Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) have been instrumental in supporting the development of these sectors. These initiatives focus on improving infrastructure, providing access to animal healthcare, and promoting sustainable fish farming practices, all of which are crucial for enhancing the resilience of rural communities in rainfed regions. SUMMARY Livestock and fisheries-based farming systems in rainfed regions is a vital strategy for building resilience, enhancing nutritional security, and diversifying rural incomes. By optimizing resource-use and reducing dependency on unpredictable crop yields, these sectors provide rural households with sustainable means of livelihood. As climate variability and water scarcity continue to challenge rainfed regions, the role of livestock and fisheries in creating resilient farming systems will only become more critical. With appropriate government support, infrastructure, and community- based management, the potential of livestock and fisheries to transform rural economies and improve the well-being of farmers in rainfed regions is immense. *Corresponding author email: Ramana.Dbv@icar.gov.in Physical chemistry of soil and soil mineralogy are the two pillars which form the basic foundation of soil science. Once the students become familiar with these basic concepts, they can easily understand the other properties of the soil, say physical and biological properties, pedology and soil fertility.
