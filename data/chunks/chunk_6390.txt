A total of 358,588 improved chicken varieties have been distributed in their respective regions/states. Shelf-Life of CARI poultry semen diluent: The investigation to extend the chicken semen storage period in native and exotic breeds revealed that the fertilizing ability of exotic chicken breed (94.61%) and that of native chicken (Aseel - 91.65% and Kadaknath - 92.57%) was in the acceptable range (>90%). Thus, CARI poultry semen diluent can be used to store the chicken semen up to 48 h at low temperature (8°C) for obtaining good fertility following collection eggs from 2-6 days post insemination. Whole genome sequencing of guinea fowl: Next-generation sequencing technology was utilized to sequence the genome of the KADAMBRI variety of Guinea fowl with 20× coverage in an Illumina platform (150 bp paired end reads). The KADAMBARI Guinea fowl population exhibited an average genome heterozygosity of 0.47. A total of 420 candidate genes governing cellular response to stress, 35 as thermo- tolerant candidates and 18 as immune tolerant genes were identified. Functional annotation of these candidate genes revealed 58 molecular functions (MF), 800 biological processes (BP), 31 cellular components (CC), and 8 KEGG pathways among the highly connected differentially expressed genes. ❑ ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 49 Breeding and rearing of fishes under controlled conditions: Goldlined seabream (Rhabdosargus sarba), a euryhaline species, belonging to Sparidae family has a better potential for farming both in the ponds and cages. Successful induced breeding was achieved in captivity in >2 years matured male and female fishes during second week of December 2022.
