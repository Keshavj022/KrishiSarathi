Livestock and Fisheries Livestock and fisheries sector has gained prominence during the past three decades owing to its impressive growth and increasing GDP contribution within the agricultural sector. Livestock rearing practices have dramatically changed in recent years from subsistence to commercial, subsidiary to main-occupational and unorganized to intensively organized systems. In Karnataka, livestock sector plays an important role in improving the economic status of the rural farmers who are dependent on the livestock for their livelihood. Karnataka is the 9th largest state in cattle and buffalo population in the country, accounting for 4.3 per cent of the total population as per the latest Livestock Census, 2012. It has 2.9 crore of livestock and 5.3 crore of poultry population. The share of livestock sector in gross state domestic product of agriculture and allied activities was 20.27% during 2014-15. The share of Karnataka in all India poultry and livestock population was 5.41% and 7.33% respectively. Government of India has declared the State as a render pest disease free zone. To provide health care to the animals and for improvement and development of breeds of animals, various programmes are implemented successfully by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services, through its institutional network. However, according to the latest research conducted by ICAR on foot and mouth disease (FMD) in livestock, the reoccurrence of foot-and-mouth Disease (FMD) outbreaks remain a major challenge. India is losing a whopping Rs 18,000 crore annually due to the dreaded foot and mouth disease (FMD) in livestock and indirect losses due to FMD are to the tune of Rs. 30000 – 35000 crores annually. These losses are because of lower milk production and meet of infected animals is not good for consumption. Development of livestock and fisheries must receive a high priority in the efforts for diversifying agriculture and doubling farmer’s income.
