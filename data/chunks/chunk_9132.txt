 Sugarcane Co 8021 ‘pe belt of India Sugarcane cutter-cum-planter developed at the CIAE, 180 Bhopal, is widely used by the farmers in the sugarcane Supardare Co 1148 ie CoC 671 The tropical cane varieties Co 6304, Co 8362, Co 7314, CoC 671, Co 6907, Co 8021 and the subtropical Co 1148, Co 7717, Co 87268 and Co 87277 have ushered in a “Sugar Revolution” in India— producing 13.4 million tonnes of sugar from 3.84 million hectares.

The protocol has been standaridized at the SBI, Coimbatore Response to Azospirillum and Coimbatore Azotobacter, and control (Left to Right), Experimental Field, SBI, Coimbatore While area under the sugarcane crop has only doubled (from 1.5 million hect- ares to 3.6 million hectares), our production has risen 4 times (from 50 million tonnes to 230 million tonnes). We have been able to step up the average productivity 2 times — from 34 tonnes/ha to 63 tonnes/ha, peak productivity being 100 tonnes/ha. And, therefore, we are the largest producer of sugar in the world — 13.4 million tonnes. The Sugarcane Breeding Institute (SBI), Coimbatore, holds the largest germplasm collection of the crop in the world — 3,500 accessions. The fluff supplied by the SBI, Coimbatore, has led to the development of out- standing varieties — Co J 64, CoC 671, CoLK 8001, Co LK 8102, CoS 767 and Co PANT 84211. Integrated Pest Management to control Pyrilla; eradication of red-rot in several parts of the country; ratoon management; intercropping and crop physiology in relation to drought are core research achievements in the crop. MICROPROPAGATION IN SUGARCANE .. . In less than five-and-a-half months, 77,760 plantlets of sugarcane may be produced from a single ex plant in vitro. The technique has been standardized at the Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow. The cost of a plantlet works out to Re 1.45. Wonder cane Co 419 OILSEEDS Niger IGP 76 ~ A male-sterile line of niger because of a very low multiplication ratio (1:8), has been overcome with the sugarcane lending itself to micropropagation. The wonder cane Co 419 and canes Co 527, and Co 6806 are very popular in African countries Sudan, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and the East Asian countries Vietnam and Koreas. The Indian bred Co 419, Co 997, Co 775, Co 312 and Co 740 are widely used as parents in breeding programmes in many countries including Australia and Thailand. IN FUTURE... The sugarcane yields up to 90 tonnes/ha in the tropics, ideally 120 tonnes/ha in Peninsular India, but 50-60 tonnes/ha in the subtropics and the sugar content normally fluctuates between 17.
