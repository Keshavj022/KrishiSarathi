 Maximum extent of control of caseworm infestation (61.53%) was recorded by application of chemical insecticide (T4). This treatment (T4) was followed by T2 (28.64%) and T3 (18.84%) at 30 DAT. Similar results were recorded at 60 DAT (Table 2). Use of parasi leaves was effective in reducing caseworm population at 30 and 60 DAT during 2003-04 and 2004-05 cropping seasons (Table 3). Maximum extent of caseworm population control (91%) and (97.5%) was recorded by application of chemical insecticide (T4) at 30 DAT and 60 DAT. This treatment (T4) was followed by T2 (application of parasi leaves @ 100 kg/ha), which recorded 83.0 and 88.1% caseworm population control at 30 and 60 DAT respectively (Table 4). At Central research Farm, BCKV, Gayashpur, the caseworm infestation was low during the Table 1. Effect of application of parasi and sali leaves and application of chlorpyriphos on caseworm infestation at Khaspokharia (mean of 2003 and 2004) Contents PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT Table 2. Extent of control of caseworm infestation at Khaspokharia (mean of 2003 and 2004) Table 3.Effect of application of parsa and sali leaves and chlorpyriphos on population of caseworm infestation at Khaspokfiaria (mean of 2003 and 2004) Table 4. Extent of control of caseworm population at Khaspokharia (mean of 2003 and 2004) season. Infestation started about 10 days after transplanting of the crop, and relatively higher level of infestation was recorded at 3 weeks after transplanting. Low level of infestation continued till 5 weeks after transplanting, after which the infestation was totally seized. Only a few scattered leaf cases containing larvae, were recorded on the plots during different observations. The percentage of leaves that showed caseworm damage as recorded after 3 weeks of transplanting was 3.16% in chlorpyriphos, 4.69% mparasi, 5.76% in sali and 7.52% in untreated control. Amongst different treatments, chlorpyriphos (0.05%) was superior to all other treatments. Parasi and sali were at par but only the former (parasa) differed significantly from the control. Effect on yield and benefit: cost ratio Chloropyriphos (0.05% a.i.) gave highest grain Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE yield (40.77 q/ha) followed by parasi (39.54 q/ha) and sali (39.04 q/ha). However, none of the treatments differed significantly from control (37.79 q/ha) in respect of grain yield. The chemical treatment, chlorpyriphos (0.05% a. i.) gave highest additional yield (2.98 q/ha) and additional return (Rs 1,788.0/ha) followed by parsa (1.75 q/ha and Rs 1,050.0/ha respectively) and sali leaves (1.25 q/ha and Rs 750/ha, respectively). However, this treatment ranked 2nd and 3rd in respect of net additional return and benefit: cost ratio respectively. Parasi leaves ranked first in both the parameters. Sali leaves, though ranked second in benefit: cost ratio, ranked 3rd in net additional return.
