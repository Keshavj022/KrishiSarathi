 In addition, policy and planning documents were analysed and the internet was browsed to obtain additional info on the latest developments in for in- stance EU Court rulings (Germany) and impact of Covid-lockdown on water quality (Ganges). Based on those sources, an initial case analysis was writ- ten that covered all variables. The case analyses presented in this paper were revised during subsequent rounds of writing. Each case analysis con- tains a narrative summary of the reorientation by discussing variables (A) to (F) and highlighting key contextual limitations for reform in agricul- tural water management. The cases are then compared, and the achieved change is quantitatively assessed (variable E and F) across the three cases on a continuous scale ranging from “not present” to “somewhat present” and “very present”. The quantiﬁcations were derived from the case analy- ses, and they were made through expert judgment by the author. The Table 1 Variables and indicators for study of a reorientation. Variables Indicators References and considerations for operationalisation Independent variable A: shifts in priorities Current and past societal priorities, as manifest in plans, policies and investments to serve economic, agricultural, water distribution, environmental, climate change and other interests Distinct shift with direct consequences for agricultural water management (Kirschke et al., 2019; Vo et al., 2019) Mediating variable B: status quo of agricultural water management in region X National and regional plans and policies for agriculture and water that capture the status quo of agricultural water management before priorities began to shift (Molle et al., 2009; Griewald, 2018) Rules, both formal (e.g., policy documents, decision-making, water distribution) and informal, governing land and water allocations and farming practices (Mollinga et al., 2007; Hoogesteger and Wester, 2017) Farm size, key agricultural subsectors, cropping and production patterns, farm socio-economics (Meurs and Bogushev, 2008; FAOSTAT, 2022) Land and water resources quality, use and infrastructure, water withdrawal and replenishment, in- and outﬂowing water resources (FAO, 2020; FAO AQUASTAT, 2022) Sustainability of natural resource base, including ecosystem sustainability, environmental degradation, and social and intergenerational equity (Gordon et al., 2010; Reganold and Wachter, 2016) Moderating variable C: efforts to adjust agricultural water management to shifted priorities Actor support in terms of consent and opposition to changes in policies, farming practices and management of the land and water system (Checkland and Scholes, 1990; Seijger et al., 2019) Policy instruments such as export taxes, crop subsidies, water prices, training and other mechanisms with a regulatory, economic or information purpose (Hellegers and Van Ierland, 2003; Garrett et al.
