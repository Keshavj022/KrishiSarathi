 At Raichur, in sunflower - chickpea cropping sequence for sustainable production, it was possible to substitute 50% P needs of chickpea by seed treatment with phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria along with 5 tonnes/ha of farmyard manure, provided sunflower receives recommended P. In Marathwada region of Maharashtra (Latur), incorporation of sunflower stalks, treated with cellulotic micro-organisms, was found reducing fertilizer needs of chickpea by 25% besides increasing profitability by Rs 700 to Rs 800/ha in sunflower-chickpea cropping sequence. Imidacloprid 70WS at 5 g/kg of seed as seed dresser or Imidacloprid 200SL at 0.1 ml/litre of water as foliar spray at 15-20 days interval was observed to be effective against leaf hoppers and thrips besides reducing necrosis disease in sunflower during early stages. SAFFLOWER A non-spiny safflower NARI 6, cross between Co1 and JL 8, has been found tolerant to Alternaria and Cercospora diseases. It matures in 135 days, and has an average yield of 1,024 kg/ha. PH 6, a non-spiny hybrid, with 25 and 10% seed yield superiority to non-spiny check JSI 7 and spiny check A 1, has been identified for irrigated areas. NARI-P 7, JLSF 416, GMU 6943, GMU 6957, GMU 6967, GMU 6968, GMU 6969 and GMU6980 have showed promise against foliar diseases. Conservation seed-drill for soybean ● ●● ●● Stable CMS lines with cytoplasm and nuclear genome of Morden have been isolated and their isogenic fertile counterparts identified. Interspecific sunflower promising derivatives with resistance to Alternaria, downy mildew and rust ● ●● ●● A non-spiny safflower variety NARI 6 and a hybrid PH 6 have been released. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 30 PBNS 12 safflower with 12% yield superiority to national check A 1 has been identified for irrigated areas. Sulphur fertilization up to 15 kg/ha at Phaltan and 45 kg/ha at Solapur and Tandur through single superphosphate significantly enhanced yield. Seed treatment with Azotobacter or Azospirillum at Solapur could effectively substitute 50% N needs of safflower in rainfed areas. CASTOR Three entries of castor RG 2528, RG 2529 and RG 2559 have been found wilt free. And RG 1713, RG 1726, RG 1741, RG 1743, RG 2088, RG 2040, RG 2377, RG 2522, RG 2535, RG 2559 and RG 2580 have showed resistance (<10 capsule infestation) to Botrytis in artificial screening. A protocol for castor transformation through Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer has been optimized. Best response was achieved with a titre of 1:20 and a cocultivation duration of 15 min. To control castor semilooper, strain 4D21 of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) multiplied in the fermentor on molasses was tested at Govindhally and Palem in 0.5 acre each with 0.07% Endosulfan and 0.1% commercial Bt (HALT) as checks. Feeding cessation of larvae occurred within 2 hours and mortality was observed within 24 hours.
