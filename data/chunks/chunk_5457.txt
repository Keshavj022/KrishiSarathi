In desert during summer the temperature goes very high and in winter it touches around freezing point. People of village Gilakor of district Jodhpur in Rajasthan have developed jhompra technique for residing. It remains cool during summer and provides good protection in winter besides keeping safe from chilling cold of the desert. Jhompra is cheap, good looking and durable. Rain water does not enter the roof of jhompra. Most peculiar characteristic of jhompra is its resistance to earthquake. Normally it takes 1 week for its preparation. Materials required are: murrain, loam soil (yellow coloured), cowdung, pearlmillet husk and stem, khejri stick, thick and thin ropes. Method: Murram, loam soil, cowdung and pearlmillet husk and water are mixed by trampling with feet, to get a homogeneous mixture. At the place where these jhompras are to be prepared, sand is excavated up to a depth of 6 inches.
