 Frontline Demonstrations Cluster Frontline Demonstration A detailed programme was planned, prepared and executed by Division of Agriculture Extension, ICAR, New Delhi on Cluster Frontline Demonstrations (CFLDs) with funding support under NFSM, Department of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, GoI, New Delhi with an objective to demonstrate the production potential of improved production and protection technologies of major pulse (chickpea, pigeon pea, lentil, blackgram and greengram) and oilseed (sesame, groundnut, linseed, soybean, mustard, sunflower) crops in the country. Analysis of district specific production constraints, preparing technology modules for each district, knowledge and skill up gradation of identified KVKs and extension workers, and regular monitoring have been the key components of this programme. Cluster Frontline Demonstration on Pulses: A total of 52,260 CFLDs on different pulse crops were organized covering 19,784.53 ha area (7,014.72 ha area and 17,946 demonstrations in kharif, 9,106.81 ha area and 26,505 demonstrations in rabi and 3,663 ha area and 7,809 demonstrations in summer). Yield advantage through CFLDs of various pulse crops ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 138 TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, DEMONSTRATION AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 139 Yield advantage through CFLDs of various oilseed crops over state and check yield was significant. In groundnut crop yield advantage through cluster frontline demonstrations over the state and check yield was 24.5 and 34.64%. The yield advantage was 36.23 and 30.9% in soybean; 5.72 and 35.55% in sesame; 42.15 and 29.59% in mustard; 54.15 and 30.47% in linseed; 13.29 and 34.13% in niger; 8.71 and 26.36% in sunflower; 62.73 and 33.76% in castor, and 23.96 and 34.3% in safflower over state and check yield, respectively. over national, state and check yield was significant. In blackgram, yield advantage through cluster frontline demonstrations over the national, state and check yield was 265.45, 177.48 and 34.40%, respectively; in greengram 80.38, 27.02 and 39.80%; and in pigeon pea 64.50, 115.13 and 35.72%, respectively. Likewise, significant yield advantage recorded through cluster frontline demonstrations was 135.80, 130.74, 30.40%, in chickpea; 73.55, 189.73 and 35.73% in field pea; and 60.98, 122.24 and 35.07% in lentil over national, state and check yield, respectively. Cluster Frontline Demonstration on Oilseeds: In all, 74,754 CFLDs on different pulse crops were organized covering 29,955.20 area (7,157.60 ha area and 17,740 demonstrations in kharif, 19,568.60 ha area and 48,711 demonstrations in rabi and 3,229.00 ha area and 8,303 demonstrations in summer).
