A further consistency check is done following Saaty’s formula: CI = (λ max − n) / ( n−1) (3) Here, n is the size of the matrix that is 5, whereas λ max is the product of Aw and Nw, which is equal to 5.139. Consistency Ratio (CR) is estimated using following formula: CR = CI/RC (4) Here, CR less than or equal to 0.1 is considered acceptable for pairwise comparison results. In this study, CR turned out to be 0.031, which approves the validity of the model. 3.3. LULC mapping and its correlation analysis Annual LULC maps were generated using the ‘Random Forest’ machine learning algorithm and applied to Landsat images using Earth Engine prowess. Cloud-free annual Landsat images were retrieved from 2007 to 2022. The Pavagadh solar power park commenced its construction in the year 2017. This way, the considered time period covers the analysis years before and after the onset of the power plant. Remote sensing serves as a valuable tool for investigating the interrelationships among water, energy, and food systems by providing appropriate data across multiple facets [66]. It can facilitate the evaluation of critical factors such as water availability and quality, agricultural land utilization and productivity, as well as energy utilization patterns. In this study, we utilized remote sensing to examine the nexus between these elements, focusing on specific indicators: surface water cover for assessing water availability, irrigated land cover to monitor agricultural activities, and solar farm area cover to analyze solar power generation. By extrapolating annual land cover area statistics from the generated data, we could discern trends in these activities over time. Furthermore, through correlation analysis, we quantified the degree of influence that each of these parameters exerts on one another within the SAW Nexus framework. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a statistical measure that measures the linear correlation between two variables. The coef­ ficient ranges from −1 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, −1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation. This method was helpful in determining the relationships within the SAW nexus. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a statistical technique used to identify and measure the relationships between two sets of variables. CCA identifies the linear combinations of variables in each set that are most strongly correlated with one another, and quantifies the strength of these corre­ lations in terms of a canonical correlation coefficient. Required data for the analysis was acquired from ICRISAT, India web portal (http://data.icrisat.org/dld/src/crops.html). It provides a comprehensive collection of agricultural data related to irrigation.
