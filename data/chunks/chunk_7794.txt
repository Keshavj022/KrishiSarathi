Oilseeds (other than CFLDs): Demonstrations (5,395) were conducted covering an area of 2,475 ha. Demonstrations were more on groundnut (1,472) followed by mustard (1,154), soybean (840) and sesame (649). Groundnut yield showed an increase of 36.5% in demonstrations over the yield obtained in farmers’ practice followed by sunflower (34.9%) and mustard (31.6%). Commercial crops: The KVKs conducted 1,421 demonstrations on different commercial crops covering an area of 630 ha. Highest number of FLDs were conducted on cotton (870) followed by sugarcane (351) and jute (200). The yield increase in demonstration was 19.1% in cotton over the yield obtained in farmers’ practice, 23% in jute and 15% in sugarcane. Fodder crops: Demonstrations (3,264) on different fodder crops (berseem, maize, sorghum, napier grass, etc.) were conducted on farmers’ fields covering an area of 547 ha. The yield increase in demonstration on maize was 76.4%, oats 25.7%, berseem and lucerne 22.4%, and bajra 11.5% over the yield obtained in farmer’s produce.
