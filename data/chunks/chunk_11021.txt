 32 Ex-situ Crop Residue Management Options • Procurement price of alcohol by the government of India is ` 45.69 per litre (for ‘C-heavy molasses) • Sale price of the compost manure is ` 1.0 per kg. It was not possible to obtain direct or indirect data on costs of production of alcohol from rice straw plant. The costs of production of alcohol based on costs of a unit in Japan was available from a literature. That cost was converted to INR for further analysis. Based on the literature data, cost of production of alcohol from paddy straw (operational costs) is ` 105.00 per litre. Table 12. Estimation of returns and costs for a paddy straw based alcohol producing plant Sl. No. Cost Particulars Costs ` lakhs Per Year Price Realised 1. Price realised by selling alcohol 13,707.00 (at ` 45.69 per litre 300 lakh liters) 2. Price realised by selling manure 1,800.00 (at ` 1.00 per kg for 1800 lakhs kg manure) A. Total price realised 15,507.00 Cost of Production 1. Total cost of producing 300 lakhs litres 31,500.00 of alcohol per year from paddy straw (based on the data from: Takimura et al. 2013) B. Total Running Costs 31,500.00 C. Net loss per year from a plant of alcohol -15,993.00 production capacity 300 lakh litres per year (A-B) Due to heavy monetary loss for a plant of alcohol production capacity of 300 lakh litres per years (of the order of about ` 16,000/- lakhs per year), the option of alcohol production from paddy straw was not considered as a viable option and was dropped from further consideration.  33 Composting of Paddy Straw Off the Cultivating Area C OMPOST contains a range of micronutrients and microorganisms that are beneficial to crop growth and soil health, and which are not usually contained in inorganic fertilizers. Although organic fertilizers, including paddy compost, are often low in major nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), they contain beneficial micronutrients, enzymes and micro- organisms. The key to make good compost is adequate supply of N, moisture content, and abundant microorganisms. For better composting, paddy straw/biomass should be chopped into small pieces (of sizes 3 to 5 cm). If possible, compost heaps should be built in layers consisting of cereal crop material (high C and low N content) combined with legume or manure wastes (higher N content). To aid decomposition, a dilute solution of N fertilizer (such as urea) and/or with a micro-organism solution (e.g., Trichoderma harzianum commonly called “tricho”) are sprinkled on the composting biomass. The farm compost can be made either in trench after cutting straw in to small pieces or making heap formation of straw. Compost making in trench Farm compost is made by placing farm wastes in trenches of suitable size, say, 4.5 m to 5.0 m long, 1.5m to 2.0 m wide and 1.0 m to 2.0 m deep. Crop/farm waste is placed in the trenches layer by layer. Each layer is well moistened by sprinkling cow dung slurry or water. Trenches are filled up to a height of 0.
