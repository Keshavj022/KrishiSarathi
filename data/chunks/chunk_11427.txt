 Delayed sowing of wheat due to late harvesting paddy, of wheat varieties HD 3118, HD 2985, HI 1563, DBW 107, DBW 14, HD 2643, HP 1633, HD 2307, DBW 173, PBW 752, HUW 234, PBW 373, Sabour Shrestha. Recommended varieties under dry areas are- HD 3171, HD 2888, K 8027, C 306, MACS 6145, Sabour Nirjal, HDR 77, K 9465. Under normal sown crop maintain the row spacing of 20cm and in delayed sown condition 18 cm between two rows. Apply 150-120 kg N, 60 kg P2O5 and 40 kg K2O per hectare for optimum productivity. The N is to be applied in two split doses of 60 kg as basal and the remaining 60-70 kg at first irrigation and full dose phosphorus and potash as basal. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 173 Apply Zinc @ 25kg/ha in rice-wheat system to increase the yield. In late sown condition apply 100-120kgN, 40kg P2O5 and 20kg K2O/ha and in rain-fed situation apply 60kgN, 30kgP2O5 and 20kg K2O/ha. Give one irrigation at CRI stage (crown root initiation) stage at 20-25 days after sowing and another irrigation at heading stage are crucial when plant suffers due to moisture stress. Generally, four irrigations are required during critical stages of crop growth in Bihar, 1st at CRI stage (20-25 DAS), 2nd late Jointing stage (40-45 DAS), 3rd at heading stage (65-70 DAS) and 4th at milking stage (90-100 DAS). Wheat field is generally infested both by broad and narrow leaves weeds. For controlling of mixed weed flora narrow and broad leaf weed sulfosulfuron + metsulfuron @40g/ha or clodinofob + metsulfuron 400g/ha mixed with 500L of water applied after 25- 30DAS. For control of broad leaf weed apply metsulfuron @10g a.i./ha or 2,4-D Na salt @ 1.0 kg /ha after 30-35DAS. Maize Complete the sowing of maize from mid-October to mid- November in rows, at a spacing of 60Ã—20 cm using seed drill and maintain optimum depth 5-7 cm. Cultivate improved hybrid variety like Ganga 11, DHM 103, DHM 105, Rajendra hybrid makka-1, ICI 705, Dhawal, Laxmi, Devaki, Saktiman 1, Saktiman 2, Saktiman 3, Saktiman 4. Timely sowing of maize can be sown with zero till drill. Use Gramoxone 24 SL (paraquat) @1.25 L in 500 litres of water per ha before sowing for control of weeds. For higher yield of maize, apply recommended quantity of manures and fertilizers (10 T FYM/ ha, 150-180kg N, 70-80kg P2O5, 70-80kg K2O and 25kg ZnSO4 per ha. Apply full dose of phosphorous and ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 174 potash and 1/3 N at the time of sowing and 1/3 N at the knee-high stage and the remaining 1/3 at the pre-tasselling stage. In zinc deficient areas apply 25 kg of zinc sulphate heptahydrate (21%) or 16.25 zinc sulphate monohydrate (33%) per ha at the time of sowing Seedling, knee height stage, flowering and grain filling are the most critical stage for irrigation in maize and ensure water supply during these stages.
