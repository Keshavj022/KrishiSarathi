 Improving road infrastructure might be of little concern for producers of high-value local crops, as these farmers still can choose to sell to an APMC mandi, as it is more profitable for them. The negative relationship between the distance to the closest contractor and the probability of engaging with pre-harvest contractors is unsurprising. Pre-harvest contractors prefer to give contracts to farmers within a maximum radius. Public transportation and edu­ cation availability are positively related to selling to pre-harvest contractors. This implies that public transportation and education Table 5 Coefficient stability. (1) (2) (3) (4) Coefficient of interest Pomegranate Baby corn Okra Onion Panel A.

Sensitivity analysis for the statistically significant market channel variables of the high-value crop (baby corn, okra, and onion). Note: A line denoting cbar = 1 represents arbitrarily endogenous controls. As the value of cbar gets closer to zero, one gets closer to assuming exogenous controls. Completely exogenous controls is denoted by cbar = 0. Table 6 Correlates of farmers’ choice of market channel (pooled sample).
