Naz, Status of potentially toxic metal pollution in the agricultural soils near to India’s largest chromite mine, Materials Today: Proceedings, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2023.05.015 [6]. These minerals convert the soil to serpentine and talc- serpentine [6,7]. Due to the high concentration of Cr in the mining and surrounding soils in the Sukinda Valley region, this area is listed as the fourth most polluted region of the world [8,9,10]. High chromium concentration in the soil and water leads to stomach ulcers, vomiting, cancer, and even death. [4,11]. Lead is the 37th most abundant heavy metal in the earth’s crust and is used in various industrial processes including the manufac- turing of batteries, solders, pigmentation, cable sheathing, ammu- nition, and manufacturing machinery and for radiation protection [12]. The natural soil contains 10–40 mgkg1 of Pb [13]. Pb concen- tration in the soil leads to ecological and human health risks via biomagniﬁcation [14]. Exposure to Pb leads to morphological, physiological, and biochemical dysfunction in plants and damage to the brain and central nervous system in humans [15,16]. Cad- mium is one of the most bioavailable heavy metals, thus it bioac- cumulates and translocates in the plants very easily [17]. Cd concentration in the soil varies from 0.01 to 1 mgkg1 worldwide but during weathering, mining, casting, and smelting [18]. Expo- sure of Cd to plants affects plant growth and metabolism by replac- ing Zn due to its chemical similarity with Zn [19]. Cd exposure in humans can cause kidney, bone, and lung diseases, as well as it, affect human reproduction [20]. Nickel is the found in maﬁc and ultramaﬁc rock alongwith chromium in nickeliferous chromite ore and is found to be 20–30 mgkg1 in the natural soil [21]. Sukinda region consists of maﬁc and ultramaﬁc rocks and thus the Ni concentration varied from 341.23– to 1609.8 mgkg1 in the soil [4]. Due to the high concentration of Ni in the overburden soil (OB), researchers are searching for feasible process of Ni recov- ery from these soils [22,23]. Exposure to a high concentration of Ni can cause wilting, narcosis in plant leaves, and inhibition of plant growth [24]. In humans, exposure to Ni can cause skin infections and allergies [25]. Other PTEs such as Fe, Mn, and Zn are micronu- trients and their concentration in soil determines the soil fertility [26].
