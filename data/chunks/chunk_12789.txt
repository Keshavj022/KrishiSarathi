 Uttar Pradesh has huge diversity with 9 agro-climatic zones characterized by   Dryland areas of Bundelkhand with an annual rainfall of about 65 cm. 610 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022   North-Eastern parts of the state receiving 140 cm annual rainfall.   Temperature varies from 1.50C recorded in Western Plain zone to 47.80C in Bundelkhand zone.   The cropping intensity varies from 111% (Bundelkhand region) to 157% (Western region). Major limitations of different agro-climatic zones are   Sodic soils in Central Plain.   Brackish water, alkalinity and undulating ravines in South Western Semi Arid zone.   Rainfed situation in Bundelkhand.   Flood-prone area in North Eastern Plain zone.   Saline & alkaline soils and diaralands in Eastern Plain zone.   Undulating and rocky area in Vindhyan zone.   Salinity & alkalinity, water logging in Western Region.   Problem of drainage in Bhabar & Tarai zone.   Six out of nine zones possess better irrigation facilities and soil fertility status where rice-wheat, rice sugarcane cropping systems are most popular and these zones mainly contribute to rice, wheat and sugarcane production. Three zones viz, South Western Semi Arid zone, Bundelkhand and Vindhyan zones possess relatively low irrigation facilities and soils are also average-to-medium in fertility and contribute major share of pulses and oilseeds production in the state. The major crops of the State are rice, wheat, maize, sugarcane, chickpea, urdbean and pigeonpea. The major crops of the State are rice, wheat, maize, sugarcane, chickpea, urdbean and pigeonpea, pulses chickpea, urd and pigeonpea occupied 1.82%,2.21% and 1.12%, rapeseed & mustard and sesamum (Til) are the two major oil seeds crops of the state. Of the gross cropped area mustard occupied 2.44% followed by 1.51% under sesamum and cropping intensity is 156%. The productivity gap in Uttar Pradesh in different crops compared to national average ranges between 7.6 % to 47.5%.Majority of the state population depends upon farming activities. Uttar Pradesh is a major contributor to the national food grain stock. It has been observed that the productivity enhancement during last five years in most of the crops have almost been decimal in the State. This indicates that livestock is a potential source of income and its integration with other economic activities, making value added products and retail trading can play important role in doubling farmers’ income. Uttar Pradesh ranks first in sugarcane, potato area and production and the state ranks first in milk production and contributes about 17% (26.4 million tonnes) to the total national. 611 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 29.1 Productivity Gaps and Major Constraints Rice Constraints   Continuous use of traditional varieties and lack of awareness among farmers about high yielding varieties/hybrids specially in upland, rainfed, lowland and deep water areas.
