Application of mustard oil in lentil  GRAIN/SEED STORAGE  GRAIN/SEED STORAGE GRAIN/SEED STORAGE The results observed indicated that: 1.The villagers considered that pulse treated with oil had the best protection from stored grain pests, observed after 2 months only, whereas the treatment where oil was not used had the least protection after 3 months from insects. 2.Weight loss was the highest in untreated pulse after 3 months, but was least in treated pulse after 2 months or even 3 months. 3.Pulse in appearance remained as such when treated with oil, but got spoiled in appearance when oil was not applied. 4.Cooking quality did not change much except in control treatment after 3 months. 5.Keeping quality of pulse was best when treated with oil and it was worst when not treated. 6.The difference among treatments was found to be significant when ANOVA test was used. Experiment Phase I (September to January) Three pulses, viz. lentil, blackgram and greengram were used in this experiment both as whole grain as well as the splitt pulse (dali). The experiment was conducted with 10 replications. The pulses were placed during September with three treatments, viz. (i) control, (ii) application of mustard oil at the rate of 2 drops per kg, and (iii) 5 drops per kg. In all there were 180 samples for the experiment. Two observations were made, one after 2 months and the other after 4 months. After 2 months, the stored grain pests were observed in 26 samples out of 180 samples, out of which 21 samples belong to control treatment, where oil was not applied (Table 2). Among the 21 samples, 14 samples were of whole grain (blackgram 5, greengram 5 and lentil 4), whereas 7 samples were of splitt pulse (lentil 4, blackgram 1 and greengram 1). Five samples of whole pulse treated with two drops of mustard oil were observed having few insects. In none of the samples, treated with 5 drops of oil, the insect was observed. During the months-September to January due to low temperature, the insect attack on pulse was not severe. In 154 samples out of 180, no insect pest was observed, which included 39 untreated samples also (Table 3). In most of the samples, which showed the presence of insects after 2 months had the damage of 1 to 4 grains/100 grains (40 g to 100 g weight loss in 1 kg pulse). The damage was more than double in the next 2 months. It was expected that once the insect has come, it will grow fast. But the growth was not very much perhaps due to low temperature. The results, however, indicated about 25% loss in two cases of blackgram in 4 months. The damage and the loss in weight was less of splitt pulse. The insect attack was also less in the number of samples (7 samples in 2 months and 11 samples in 4 months) dali dal.
