 Furthermore, timely application of every possible measure like weeding, fertilization, on-time irrigation, and regular survey of the field helped us for early detection and diagnosis of the diseases and pests and to take up precise protection measures that would keep the infection under control and gave a healthy crop stand. Yield: Height of each plant was 6 ft. whereas the length of the spike was approx. 3 ft. During the first year, the number of hands per spike was 9-10 and the number of fingers was 20. Therefore, the total number of bananas received per plant was 200-220. During the second year, the yield received was higher than the first year. The total number of hands per spike was 12-13 and the number of fingers was 25-27 per hand. Mostly higher number of hands produced in the upper portion of the bunch and total banana harvested 250-270 per bunch. Economics: Yield obtained converted into tonne per hectare. The average per hectare production of bananas was 50 tons following the package of practices as discussed here. Considering the current prices, the gross value of this product is around ₨ 300000 per hectare and the profit from banana cultivation came to around ₨ 100000. The cost of production per tonne was calculated at ₨ 4000 while the price received by the producer came to ₨ 6000 per tonne. Thus, the price received by the producer not only covered the cost of production but also left a substantial margin of profit to the producer. The benefit-cost ratio which indicates the profitability of investment was worked out to 1.50 indicating thereby banana cultivation is highly profitable. It could be concluded from the research findings that banana cultivation holds high potential in Purba Burdwan and the surrounding area. If the farmers chose bananas along with the existing crops it will not only back them financially but also introduce crop diversification that will gradually obliterate their dependency on a single crop and the chance of total crop failure will get abridged.

The nutrient uptakes (g/plant) and the leaf nutrient concentrations of organically grown banana were also on-par with 100% inorganically fertilized crop. The organic inputs caused decline in soil pH from 8.2 to 7.2, increased EC (dS/m) from 0.21 to 0.23 and organic matter from 0.12 to 0.72%, at harvesting. The organic banana grown soil had good number of CFUs of Actinomycetes (713×101), fungi (45×102) and bacteria (153×103). The B/C of this best treatment was 1.9 against 2.8 that of inorganic fertilizer alone.
