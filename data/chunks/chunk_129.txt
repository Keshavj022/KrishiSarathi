in/NaturalFarming/ ImplementationProcess During 2022-23, as per the data released by the Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, the total area under natural farming in India is 9.5 lakh hectares in 17 states. The total number of farmers practicing natural farming within these states is estimated to be 20.08 lakhs. The highest area under natural farming has been reported from Andhra Pradesh (2.9 lakh hectares) followed by Gujarat (1.86 lakh hectares) and Madhya Pradesh (1.11 lakh hectares). the revolution’s impact on food security. However, as the saying goes, “every coin has two sides,” the Green Revolution also brought about adverse effects on ecology and human well-being. Impact of the Green Revolution The Green Revolution primarily targeted wheat and rice production in states like Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, bringing about significant changes in crop yields. Farmers in these regions experienced increased yields through the application of more fertilizers. However, the excessive use of fertilizers made the soil alkaline, which resulted in a loss of soil fertility. In the Punjab region, the use of pesticides reached approximately 923 g/ha in 2011, which was 353 g/ha higher than the national average. This extensive use of pesticides had severe implications on the health of the local population. Notably, the region gained notoriety for the ‘cancer train’ running between Bhatinda and Bikaner, underscoring the adverse health impacts. The Bhopal tragedy in 1984 serves as a poignant example of the direct and negative consequences of the chemical- intensive practices associated with the Green Revolution. The incident underscores the potential hazards and risks posed by the widespread use of such chemicals in agricultural practices. Organic farming In response to the adverse effects of the Green Revolution, a solution known as organic farming has been advocated. This environmentally friendly approach is considered safer than conventional farming. It involves utilizing inputs such as organic waste, cow dung, green manuring, bio enzymes, and some mechanical operations, which are not only less costly than chemical inputs but also contribute to sustainable agriculture. However, it demands more time and effort. One challenge of organic farming is the need for a substantial amount of organic matter, requiring the maintenance of a large number of animals to generate organic waste. Additionally, inoculating bacterial cultures and using diesel or fuel for mechanical operations entail capital investments that may be beyond the means of small or marginal farmers. Despite growing awareness of the benefits of organic products, distinguishing genuine ones can be challenging. This difficulty arises from the fact that plants absorb nutrients in inorganic forms. Nutrients in organic sources remain unavailable for crop use until the material undergoes decomposition, releasing its nutrients into the inorganic soil pool.
