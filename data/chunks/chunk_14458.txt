006 product for 19 years was used to compute VSWI, which was then normalized to develop Normalized Vegetation Supply Water Index (NVSWI) (Abbas et al., 2014), using following Eq. (9). NVSWI = VSWI −VSWImin VSWImax −VSWImin × 100 (9) Where, VSWI is vegetation supply water index for the wheat growing period, VSWImin and VSWImax are minimum and maximum value of VSWI of the pixel during the period of study, respectively. The value of Fig. 2. Standard Precipitation Index (SPI-12) and drought events in (a) ACZ I (c) ACZ II (e) ACZ III; Drought Duration (DD in months), Drought Severity (DS) and Drought Intensity (DI) (b) ACZ I (d) ACZ II and (f) ACZ III. L. Kaur et al. Agricultural Water Management 274 (2022) 107956 6 NVSWI ranges between 0 and 100, zero indicating severe drought and 100 representing wettest conditions. Severe drought (values below 20), Moderate drought (20−40), Minor drought (40−60), Normal (60−80), and Wet (values over 80) were used to classify the index values. 2.5. Correlation analysis of seasonal NVSWI with VHI, SPI, GPP and groundwater level Drought occurrence and severity are influenced by rainfall, which is one of the most important climatic elements. Since, rainfall variability and abnormality have a strong influence on drought severity, seasonal SPI-12 (December to March) was utilized as an independent variable to examine its correlation with the seasonal NVSWI during the dry and normal years. Gross primary productivity (GPP) reflects the organic productivity of the ecosystem (Beer et al., 2010; DeLucia et al., 2019). Droughts, one of the most severe climate extremes, endanger global carbon balance (Reichstein et al., 2013; Zhao and Running, 2010) and food security (Song et al., 2018), as they limit the vegetative carbon uptake. Since, it is important to understand the impact of drought on the GPP of the ecosystem, therefore, relationships between NVSWI and GPP were also worked out. Zonal statistics using administrative area (i.e., number of Taluks in each ACZ) over the agricultural pixels was used to get the mean SPI, NVSWI and GPP for their correlation analysis. More­ over, agricultural production in this area is dependent on the irrigation practices and these States are among the largest users of groundwater. To increase the crop yield and to achieve the food security, higher production during rain deficit times heavily relies on the groundwater resources. Thus, relationships between NVSWI and groundwater level and their trend analysis were also carried out. 2.6. Trend analysis of NVSWI and groundwater level using Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test (Kendall, 1975; Mann, 1945) is widely used in detecting the trends in environmental variables (Yue et al., 2002; Tabari and Marofi, 2011; Gocic and Trajkovic, 2013), due to its insensitivity to the normal distribution of data and outliers.
