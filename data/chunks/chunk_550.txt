 Among rainy season crops, greater output of mustard crop was when grown in relay cropping system after greengram followed by pearl millet and lowest with paddy-based cropping systems. By adoption of relay cropping systems, a slightly higher production cost was (`600–900/ha) found compared with total cultivation cost without relay cropping (`27,600–30,600/ ha) of mustard. The maximum additional NRs was with mustard (`8,900/ha) grown after pearl millet followed by greengram (`8,200/ha) and least with paddy (`6,400/ha). The B:C ratio ranged from 3.1–3.3 with relay cropping, whereas it was 2.9–3.1 without relay cropping. System productivity The mustard equivalent yield (MEY) of system productivity increased from 35.0–60.6% with relay cropping as compared to without relay cropping (Table 2). Among cropping systems, the paddy - mustard + berseem system gave the highest MEY (4.86 t/ha) followed by greengram - mustard + berseem (4.57 t/ha), pearl millet - mustard + berseem (4.28 t/ha) and lowest was with fallow - mustard + berseem (3.28 t/ha). Legume crop berseem is known to improve soil fertility over years contributing to increased productivity. System economics The system-based NRs were greater with relay cropping berseem compared to without relay cropping systems (Table 2). The cultivation cost slightly increased from `15,300– 15,800/ha of relay cropping berseem Berseem crop at early growth stage in mustard crop Table 1.
