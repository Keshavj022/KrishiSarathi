 graminicola with reference to the host specificity, aggressiveness and virulence • Some basic research on molecular characterization of R and AVR gene in pearl millet downy mildew system has been carried out at Mysore to explore the possibility of resistant www.icar.org.in 68 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science gene pyramiding/ stacking and other resistance gene deployment strategies to control downy mildew disease • In PMPT‐V, on‐farm biological control of downy mildew using integrated disease management module suggested that smut, blast, rust diseases reduced considerably due to IDM module • During kharif, 2005 field surveys were conducted to monitor occurrence of pearl millet diseases like downy mildew, smut and ergot in various districts of Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra and identified several hybrids/ varieties which are resistant to downy mildew disease • Hybrids MSH 155, MSH 166, MSH 167, MSH 173, MSH 188, MSH 190 and MSH 191 were completely free from downy mildew diseases in summer disease screening trial involving initial and advance pearl millet hybrids and varieties 5. Management of insect pests 2002‐03 • Fifty one advance entries of hybrids and varieties were evaluated for relative response to damage of different insect pests at Jamnagar and Delhi. For shootfly, response of entries to the damage at seedling stage and earhead stage varied at both locations. Percent shootfly damage was more at Jamnagar at seedling stage (7.8 to 18.9) and at earhead stage (5.5 to 33.2). Promising entries were identified at each location. Stem borer damage was observed more at Delhi and ranged from 1.7 to 12.9 per cent. Four hybrids and two varieties had less than 3.5 per cent damage. Damage to grey weevil was recorded at Delhi was high and damage grade ranged from 2.6 to 6.3. 2003‐04 • Taking three component (14, 28 DAG and ear head stage) into consideration, entries MH 1078, MH 1099, MH 1139, MH 1079, Saburi, Raj 171, Pusa 383, ICTP 8203, MH 1038, MH 1049, MH 1109, and Pusa 266 were found promising against shoot fly. Over the locations the average stem borer damage per cent ranged from 3.71% (Saburi) to 29.78% (ICTP 8203). Eleven entries viz. MH 1140, Saburi, MP 430, Raj 171, ICMB 221, MH 1038, MH 1049, MH 1109, MH 1152, MP 414 and RCB 2 were found promising. 2004‐05 • Four trials were conducted to confirm relative susceptibility of pearl millet lines from advanced and initial population and hybrid trials against key insect pests of pearl millet. • The shoot fly damge (dead hearts %) was recorded at Delhi, Jamnagar and Jaipur on 14 DAG and 28 DAG and also at earhead stage. The average seedling deadheart % of all the three locations on 14 DAG ranged from 1.24 % (Raj‐171) to 27.25% (MP429) and the damage at 28 DAG ranged from 2.95% (MH‐1192) to 18.18% (MH‐1097). Entries Raj‐171, MH‐1199, Pusa‐23, RHB‐121, MP‐441 and Pusa‐266 were found promising against shoot fly. • Eleven entries viz.
