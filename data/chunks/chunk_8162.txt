 Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar are the rabi dominating states while Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat kharif. In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, mandi remains the most important destination for selling onions. The response of major consuming and producing markets owing to price shocks in producing markets is given in Box 1. Lasalgaon, Bengaluru and Solapur remain the most influential producing markets causing the change in consuming markets besides their own influence. Pimpalgaon and Bengaluru are the most important markets influencing Indore, Lasalgaon, Mahuwa, Patna and Pimpalgaon besides their own influence. Pimpalgaon and Lasalgaon are the most important primary markets dealing with rabi onion. Bengaluru dominates in kharif onion supply and transmits the signals accordingly. Thus, market surveillance needs to be given a priority to control any imperfections and malpractices arising due to advance signals. Market intelligence can help objectively examine the extent of price influences as markets are highly co-integrated with each other and price signals are transmitted from one market to the other. Access to extension and advisory services and rice productivity in Eastern India: Improving agricultural productivity has always remained as a key strategy for achieving food security and rural development agenda. A study was done to assess the access to Extension and Advisory Services (EAS) and its effects on technical efficiency and productivity of rice producing farms in Eastern India. The study area Price influence among major onion producing and consuming markets Technical efficiency and productivity of rice farms with reference to EAS access  SOCIAL SCIENCE DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2018–19 113 Changes in cropped area and yield of crops after adoption of sprinkler irrigation Crop Cropped area (ha) Difference Average yield (q/ha) Difference Adopter Non-adopter Adopter Non-adopter Kharif Groundnut 3.71 – 30.5 – Gwar 3.36 2.37 0.99 (41.8) 13.54 11.74 1.80*** (15.3) Moth 2.70 2.70 0.0 11.48 8.80 2.68 (30.5) Bajra 2.64 1.16 1.58** (149.1) 11.76 8.33 3.43** (41.2) Moong 2.90 1.80 1.10 (60.2) 9.90 7.24 2.66** (36.7) Rabi Wheat 1.97 1.26 0.71 (56.3) 34.00 32.05 1.95*** (6.1) Rapeseed and mustard (R&M) 2.36 2.22 0.14 (21.3) 21.35 19.01 2.34*** (12.3) Gram 4.0 1.13 2.87 (254.0) 17.85 12.47 5.38 (43.1) Source: Computed from field survey, 2017–18; ***, significant at < 1%; and **, significant at < 5%.

This study analysed the farm level impacts from the Bikaner district of Rajasthan. Farmers adopting sprinkler system cultivated relatively higher area than their counterparts, and varied across seasons and crops. The increase in cropped area for rabi crops varied from 21% in rapeseed and mustard to 254% in chickpea.
