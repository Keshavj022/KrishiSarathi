 This scalability is particularly beneficial in regions with limited agricultural resources, where government agencies and international organizations can use AI-driven crop suitability mapping to guide large-scale agricultural planning and policy development. United States, Spain, and Italy are leading contributors for mapping in agriculture using AI tools. In majority cases (76%), machine learning (ML) techniques were utilized, while deep learning (DL) methods employed in about 24% applications. Key algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are frequently used in mapping activities related to agricultural management. Additionally, AI plays a vital role in various applications, including production enhancement, disease detection, crop classification, rural planning, forest dynamics, and improvements in irrigation systems. CASE STUDIES Oil palm Given its high yield potential, oil-palm is a vital cash crop, especially in tropical regions. However, ensuring sustainable and economically viable oil palm cultivation requires careful assessment of land suitability to avoid environmental degradation and economic losses. Crop suitability mapping, enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI) tools, has emerged as a powerful approach to optimize land use for oil-palm cultivation. Global perspective: In Northern Uganda, using parameters like rainfall, soil type, land cover, elevation, and slope through GIS techniques, suitability of land for oil-palm cultivation has been categorized into four classes viz. highly suitable, moderately suitable, marginally suitable, and unsuitable. The study found that 38.18% of the land was highly suitable, while only 4.87% was unsuitable. In a study in Peninsular Malaysia, utilizing Remote Sensing, GIS and Analytical Hier-Archy Process, a highly suitable climate is found around Selangor, Kelantan, Perak and Kedah. Climates that are unsuitable are predicted to increase by 5.6% (2040) and 5.72% (2080) from 1.77% in 2020. Climatic conditions will become unsuitable for oil palm production along the coast of Pahang and Selangor, and Perlis by 2080. With advancements in remote sensing technology, high-resolution satellite data has become increasingly accessible, offering detailed insights into land cover, crop health, and spatial distribution of plantations. This evolution presents significant opportunities for optimizing agricultural practices and improving yield predictions. AI models have demonstrated high accuracy in detecting palm oil trees, with some studies reporting accuracy rates as high as 91%. However, this accuracy can still be influenced by factors such as changes in lighting conditions and image resolution. To further enhance the performance of these algorithms, gathering more diverse training data and fine-tuning the models can significantly improve detection accuracy.
