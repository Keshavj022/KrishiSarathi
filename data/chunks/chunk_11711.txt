   Accreditation and gradation of germplasm centres/nurseries of important agroforestry species in different agro-climatic zones of country should be initiated.   Implements for harvesting agroforestry products such as leaves, pods, fruits etc. and processing up to net utilizable products involving industry should be developed.   Documentation, identification and standardization of climate resilient (such as efficient in CO2 assimilation, efficient water utilizer, high temperature tolerant, shade tolerant and multi – stress tolerant) agroforestry germplasm is to be carried out.

Parmar University of Horticulture & Forestry, Nauni, Solan ii Title National Symposium on Advances in Agriculture through Sustainable Technologies and Holistic Approaches (AASTHA) iii Venue and Date(s) 15-17 February 2017 at The International Centre, Dona Paula, Goa iv Amount of grant by ICAR Rs. 2.00 Lakhs v ICAR's Sanction no. F.No.23(38)/2016-Cdn.(Tech.) NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (NRM) Compendium Salient Recommendations 38 vi Recommendation:   There is ample scope and feasibility for developing multi-species aquaculture practices in unutilized semi-enclosed coastal areas of Goa as a secondary livelihood option.   Stubble shredding, off-barring, root pruning and fertilizer placement (SORF) machine could be used successfully for seeding of mungbean under surface retained chopped trash condition.   The plasma treatment on the seed coat of capsicum can enhance the germination speed by making seed coat more hydrophilic.   In cold deserts the trench technology is of immense use to the farming community for fresh vegetable production.

F.No.23(39)/2016-Cdn.(Tech.) vi Recommendation:   More emphasis needs to be given to develop operational pest-weather models as well as modify the thresholds of existing rule based models keeping in view the pest biology in relation to local weather.   Micrometeorological studies related to characterization of agro-climatic resources for major crops of the country needs to be enhanced.   Spectral reflectance studies for developing suitable vegetation index at critical crop phonological stages that relates to final crop yield need to be taken up.   Solution to bring awareness about agro-advisory bulletin and action programme, among illiterate farmers in tribal and remote areas need to be worked out.
