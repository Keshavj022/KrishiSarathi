At Faizabad, in addition to the recommended dose of NPK (150:80:80) five foliar applications of water soluble NPK fertilizer (19: 10:27) after 30 days of transplanting at 10 days interval resulted in maximum yield (395 q/ha) and highest C;B ratio (1 :3.53) of brinjal hybrid Suchitra. Hence, it is recommended for Faizabad conditions. 6. The highest yield of capsicum hybrid Bharat (167.45 q/ha) along with C:B ratio (1 :1.52) were recorded with three foliar sprays of water soluble fertilizers (15:15:30 at 45x30 cm spacing on 30th October and C:B ratio (1:1.77). Hence, it is @0.5%) at 10 days interval starting from 30 days after transplanting. Hence, it is recommended for Pantnagar conditions. Use of micro‐nutrients 7. At Coimbatore, the foliar application of ZnSo4 at 100 ppm concentration thrice starting from 40 days after transplanting resulted in the maximum yield (645.6q/ha) along with C:B ratio (1 :4.86) in case of tomato hybrid ‐ 1 (COTH‐l). Hence, it is recommended for Coimbatore conditions. 8. At Bhubaneswar, the maximum yield (431.6q/ha) of hybrid cabbage along with C:B ratio (1: 1.83) were obtained with 3 sprays of 100 ppm ZnS04 at 10 days interval starting from 40 days after transplanting. Hence it is recommended for Bhubaneswar conditions. However, at Jorhat, application of boron at same concentration resulted in maximum yield (485 q/ha) and C:B ratio of (1 :2.76) which is recommended for Jorhat conditions. Planting date cum spacing trial 9. At Jorhat, planting of broccoli cv.KTS‐l resulted in maximum yield (158 q/ha) recommended for Jorhat conditions. 10. At Kalyanpur, maximum yield (315.52 q/ha) and C:B ratio (1:2.27) were obtained when broccoli hybrid Fiesta was planted on 15 October at 45X30 cm spacing. Hence, it is recommended for Kanpur conditions. However, at Durgapura, the maximum yield (310.4 q/ha) and C:B ratio (1 :8.5) were obtained at 45 x 45 cm spacing on the same date oftransplanting, which may be recommended for Durgapura conditions. www.icar.org.in 32 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Horticulture Recommendations for 2004 ‐2005 Tomato • Based on the higher germination percentage, seedling vigour and economics (20 paise per seedling extra profit over control), seedling raising of hybrid tomato in 10x6 cm size polyethylene bags on raised bed with polyethylene layer is recommended under Pantnagar conditions of Tarai area. • Planting of tomato indeterminate hybrid ARTH‐4 at 80x60 cm spacing on raised beds along with staking is recommended for higher yield (334 q/ha) and C:B ration (1 :3 :41) under Pantnagar conditions. Planting at 80 x 45 cm spacing along with staking is recommended for maximum yield (439 q/ha) and C:B ratio (1 :4:52) under Coimbatore conditions.
