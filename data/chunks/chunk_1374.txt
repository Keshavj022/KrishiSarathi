 Furthermore, the net returns from adopting these improved varieties were notably higher across all three crops, indicating that investing in these varieties is economically viable. The benefit-to-cost ratio further highlighted this trend, as farmers achieved a higher ratio by adopting the improved varieties promoted under the Farmer FIRST Programme. In the case of vegetables (Table 2), the cost of adopting new cultivars was significantly higher for brinjal (Kashi Sandesh) and tomato (Kashi Abhiman), primarily due to the higher initial investments required for seeds, inputs, and specific agronomic practices. These improved varieties often require more careful management, including tailored irrigation and pest control measures, which contribute to increased cultivation costs. In contrast, the cost of adopting the improved chilli variety (Kashi Ratna) was significantly lower, as it generally requires fewer resources and is easier to cultivate, making it more accessible for farmers. Despite the higher adoption costs for brinjal and tomato, the improved cultivars offer substantial yield advantages over local varieties, leading to increased overall productivity. Consequently, farmers who adopted these improved cultivars achieved a higher benefit-to-cost ratio, as the increased yields and market demand often offset the initial expenses. This ultimately enhanced their profitability and encouraged the adoption of these varieties for future seasons. Among fodder crops, farmers showed a keen interest in adopting improved varieties of rabi fodders, particularly because during the kharif season, they faced challenges related to 'annapratha'—a practice where farmers let their animals graze freely in others’ fields. This practice often led to overgrazing and limited the cultivation of kharif crops, making farmers hesitant to invest in kharif fodder varieties. Recognizing the need for reliable fodder sources, many farmers who had previously neglected the oat crop began cultivating it after realizing its potential for producing green fodder. The improved yield (around 5 t/ha) and nutritional benefits of oats became apparent, encouraging its adoption. Additionally, farmers initially relied on the local variety of berseem, known as Mescavi. However, after discussions with the FFP team, they shifted to the Table 1.
