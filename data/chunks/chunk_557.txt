He attended a 2-day training camp and started practicing natural farming in his farm. He said that initially people were of view that adopting the new method would result in loss of crop but he got good results in the first year itself. He also attended the World Organic Expo in 2019 with his produce. People appreciated his produce in this exhibition and he also sold black potatoes at ₹200/kg and apples at ₹325/ kg.
