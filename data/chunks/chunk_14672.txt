 [95], who investigated the growth and ripening of red onions (red creole) using potassium extracted from BP ashes. The plant of interest was chosen due to its high potassium needs. The peels were sun-dried for 7 days and then calcined at a temperature of 350 ◦C in a muffle kiln for 8 h, forming ashes. From 100 kg of BPs, 3.9 kg (3.9%) of ashes were generated. However, the composition of the ashes was not determined to compare the potassium content before and after calcination. The obtained ash was dissolved in distilled water at a 0.25 water–ash ratio to leach its potassium and the mixture was stirred for 24 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to form white crystals (86% potash). The red creole was transplanted after spending 60 days in a nursery. Urea was applied at 0 and 200 kg, and NPK at 600 kg, including in combination with K fertilizers (Table 6), after 20 days of transplanting, and observation began after 15 days of the first dosage. The K fertilizer was applied at 0, 150, and 200 kg, and the authors realized that the results of the growth parameters of the red onion were similar to the untreated control samples. However, the yield parameters showed a significant difference from those of the control. This was because the fertilizer works more efficiently on the underground part of the plant and aids root development compared to aerial development. The two doses of 150 and 200 kg gave similar results due to the availability of exchangeable K in the soil solution. The authors further stipulated that the results of the 200 kg were almost similar to NPK (10:20:10) and showed that this ash-based fertilizer is suitable for a specific type of soil (drill liter). This means other soil types would be less suitable for this ash-based fertilizer. It was recommended that the fertilizer be combined with nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich fertilizers. Agriculture 2024, 14, 1894 14 of 24 Table 6 demonstrates the effects of different amounts (kg) of NPK, urea, and K fertilizer and their mixtures on the size and leaf number of onion at 65 days (T65), as well as its weight. The onions were grown in NPK (600 kg) fertilizer and those treated with combinations of NPK (600 kg) + urea (200 kg), and NPK (600 kg) + K (200 kg) had similar sizes. The NPK (600) +K (150 kg) mixture gave the highest number of leaves and plant weight of the onions. This observation can be attributed to the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus to the soil. The authors reported that a high presence of nitrogen in the soil favours the aerial development of a growing plant through photosynthesis. In general, nitrogen plays a significant role in plant growth since it regulates the biochemical and physiological functions of plants. It is the key element that produces the greatest crop response in plants, giving plants their green colour and promoting rapid vegetative growth. A nitrogen deficiency in soil is identifiable by the yellowing of plant leaves.
