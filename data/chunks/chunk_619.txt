 is 60:40:40 NPK kg/ha and 12–15 t/ha of FYM, which can be applied through the use of FYM and vermi-compost in the ratio of 1:1 at the rate of 6 t/ha of FYM and 3 t/ha of vermi-compost. FYM and vermi- compost are the most commonly and easily available sources of organic manures. FYM is incorporated in the soil at the time of land preparation and vermi-compost is applied 2–3 cm below seed during sowing in the moist soil. Biofertilizers like PSB and Azotobacter can be used to increase economical yield. Studies conducted at organic farms reveal that the phosphorus and sulphur needs (Table 1) can be met out through the use of 20 kg/ha P2O5 through rock phosphate at the rate of 110–160 kg/ha with bio-fertilisers. Table 1. Effect of sulphur and biofertilizers (PSB and Azotobacter) on grain and stover yield of mustard Treatment Grain yield (q/ha) Stover yield (q/ha) T0 RDF 10.23 32.37 (Sulphur 20 kg/ha through rock phosphate + PSB) 15.49 42.83 (Sulphur 20 kg/ha through rock phosphate + Azotobacter) 14.25 41.63 (Sulphur 20 kg/ha through rock phosphate + PSB + Azotobacter) 20.09 48.89 Choice of suitable varieties: While selecting seeds (variety) of mustard, this should be always kept in mind that seeds are certified, free from foreign material to get good germination. Varieties like Varuna, Pusa Bold, Giriraj, Super Gold and JM-3 were found most suitable in a research work done on organic farm of Bundelkhand University, Jhansi (Table 2). Other varieties that are suitable for this region are Kranti, Krishna, NarendraRai- 8501, etc. Table 2. Promising mustard varieties for organic farming in Bundelkhand Name of promising variety Yield (q/ha) Grain Stover Varuna 27.5 40.3 Pusa Bold 25.7 39.1 Giriraj 24.6 38.6 Super Gold 23.1 38.0 Ensure early sowing: The most optimum time for sowing is mid- October to first week of November. Timely sowing of crop seed is important to reduce the incidence of diseases. Studies conducted at organic farm of Bundelkhand University revealed that sowing of mustard in first week of November (4th November) was significantly better than sowing in 3rd week of November (18th November). Short duration varieties like Varuna and KMH-721 are better suited for sowing under delayed conditions (Table 3). Seed treatment and sowing methods Seed treatment with Tricoderma viridae should be done to avoid incidence of seed borne diseases. Generally, seed rate differs from variety to variety, sowing method, sowing time, germination per cent, etc., common seed rate being 4–5 kg seeds per hectare. Seeds should be sown 3–4 cm deep in a moist soil to ensure good germination. In Bundelkhand, broadcasting is the most common method practised for sowing but scientifically, seeds should be sown in lines at 45 cm apart at a distance of 15 cm. This technique ensures good germination, optimum plant population and ease in intercultural operations which ultimately improves growth and yield.
