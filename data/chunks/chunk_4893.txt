 Fruits monitoring and classification Mango: Real-time mango detection networks have been developed for mobile device processors, employing generalized attribution methods and pruning large networks using kernel attribution, while comparing weight size and computational efficiency with significant accuracy. The MangoYOLO deep learning algorithm detects mango fruits in each frame, while the Hungarian algorithm correlates fruits between neighbouring frames, enabling multiple-to-one assignments and improving mango fruit load estimation through a video-based Kalman filter method. A multilayer convolutional neural network (MCNN) has been proposed for classifying mango leaves infected by anthracnose fungus, validated on a real-time dataset of images and achieving higher classification accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, a novel system employs an unmanned ground vehicle equipped with a hyperspectral sensor, navigation system, and LIDAR to map mango maturity at the orchard scale, facilitating precision farm management, selective harvesting, and harvest scheduling. Automated assessment of panicle count by developmental stage can significantly inform farm management practices. In this context, the YOLOv3-rotated model demonstrated greater accuracy for total panicle counts, while the R2CNN-upright model excelled in panicle stage classification. Furthermore, faster regional convolutional neural networks have been utilized to map mango flowering intensity and panicle counts per canopy across an orchard, enabling the identification of early flowering trees for selective early harvest. Banana: The first deep learning application for clustered horticultural crops, specifically banana fruit tiers, has been successfully classified using a Mask R-CNN model, achieving an accuracy of 96.1% through data augmentation and improved classification techniques. An enhanced deep learning approach employing multiple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers with numerous neurons has been fully trained to forecast banana harvest yields effectively. Additionally, a deep learning-based method for detecting and counting banana plants has been developed using high-resolution images obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles. This approach utilized three image processing methods to enhance orthomosaic vegetation by generating multiple variants. Furthermore, a deep learning method for classifying banana leaf diseases, implemented using the LeNet architecture as a convolutional neural network (CNN), has proven effective under various conditions, including changes in illumination, complex backgrounds, and variations in resolution, size, pose and orientation of real scene images. The proposed CNN classification system has the potential for commercial development as a field-based automatic postharvest classification system for grading Cavendish bananas.
