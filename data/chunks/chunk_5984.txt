Lower leaves lyrate-pinnatisect with 1 -3 pairs of lateral lobes and a much larger terminal lobe, hispid on both surfaces; upper leaves linear-oblong, entire or sinuate; flowers yellow in corymbose racemes; siliqua 10- 20 cm x 1.5-2.0 mm, attenuating into a slender seedless beak; seeds very small, angled, minutely pitted, 3-10 in a fruit, the seed-coat mucilaginous. The exact time of the introduction of this species into India is not known, but it is presumed to have been introduced comparatively recently.

It does not contribute to the supplies of mustard oil.
