 This includes:   All fruits and vegetables (excluding citrus and other “high acid” foods)   Vegetable and fruit peels and ends   Grains such as bread, cracker and cereal (including mouldy and stale)   Eggshells (rinsed off)   Leaves and grass clippings (not sprayed with pesticides)   Newspapers (most inks used in newspapers are not toxic) b) Large-scale or commercial composting Such vermicomposting systems need reliable sources of large quantities of food. Systems presently operating use: Dairy cow or pig manure; Sewage sludge; Agricultural waste; Food processing and grocery waste; Grass clippings and wood chips Watershed Management: The watershed management implies, the judicious use of all the resources i.e. land, water, vegetation in an area for providing an answer to alleviate drought, absorbs the effect of flood, prevent soil erosion, improve water availability and increase food, fodder, fuel and fibre on sustained basis. The task of watershed management includes the treatment of land by using most suitable biological and engineering measures in such a manner that, the management work must be economic and socially acceptable. Rainwater harvesting means collection and storage of rainwater by some mechanism to make water available for future use. An appreciable amount of precipitation, which is generally lost as surface flow, can be harvested and stored for useful purposes like drinking and providing supplemental irrigation to the crops. In many areas, the brief monsoon season brings with it an abundance of water. However, this water is wasted and there is an acute shortage of water during the rest of the year when it is conducive to cultivate high-value vegetable crops and horticulture, especially when these crops fetch a remunerative price. State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 130 Agroforestry: Agroforestry is an effective land use system which contributes to food, nutritional and environmental security. Beside its multifarious use as food, fuel, fodder, fiber, medicine and timber, it enables smallholder farmers to optimize their land use. Also agroforestry has significant potential to provide employment and additional income to farmers. In the context of climate change, agroforestry helps in mitigating the same through microclimatic modification and carbon sequestration. Towards landscape management, agroforestry plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas (GHS) emissions and acts as an effective means of environmental services. In fact, agroforestry can help in achieving resilience in agriculture while addressing effectively the threat of climate change. Given the fact that land-holding size is shrinking, tree farming combined with agriculture is perhaps the only way forward to optimize farm productivity and thus, enhance livelihood opportunities of smallholder farmers, landless laborers and the women farmers by creating employment opportunities and additional income.
