 To identify presence of SSRs, only two to four nucleotide motifs were considered, and minimum repeat units were defined as 10, 7 and 5 reiterations for di, tri- and tetra-nucleotides repeats, respectively. A total of 10,341 SSRs were finally identified with 250-bp upstream and downstream flanking sequences. Unique SSRs were selected by utilizing one scaffold corresponding to a single SSR, which resulted in a total of 7,259 SSR sequences. Furthermore, SSRs from scaffolds containing N’s were removed, and 956 SSR sequences with flanking regions suitable for primer designing were selected. InDel identification: For this, high-quality reads were aligned to reference assembled scaffolds using BWA v.0.7.5a, with default parameters for aligning high-quality reads to reference scaffolds. The InDel positions in the aligned reads were compared against reference scaffolds using the ‘mpileup’ functions from SAMtools v. 0.1.18. A total of 5,471 InDels were identified at various positions. To validate InDels, filtration criteria adopted were: minimum mapping quality = 30 and minimum read depth >= 15. Furthermore, stringent parameters, such as 250-bpflanking sequences, InDel length >10, mapping quality of 60, read-depth of 20, etc. were used to identify only unique InDels, which resulted in a total of 44 InDels. All scaffolds containing SSRs and InDels were functionally annotated using BLASTn and BLASTx. Validation of SSR and InDel markers: Primers were Genetic diversity of organelle genome groups in Corchorus olitorius (Oα, Oβ, Oγ) and C. capsularis (Cα, Cβ, Cγ, Cδ, Cε). The organelle genetic group of wild Corchorus species is indicated by W Population structure analysis of jute based on non-Bayesian recollection approach CROP IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 52 designed for these 1,000 SSR and InDel markers using BatchPrimer3, with optimal parameters such as Tm 57- 61 and GC% 40-55, and checked for absence of hairpin structures and self-annealing. All of them were validated in several C. olitorius accessions using standard PCR and PAGE. Mitogenomes of two cultivated jute species revealed:An efficient protocol for high-quality mitochondrial DNA isolation and purification for both the cultivated jute species has been developed. Mitogenomes of C. capsularis (white jute) and C. olitorius (dark jute) were sequenced by NGS using 2 × 300 bp and 2 × 150 bp chemistry on Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq 500, respectively. Using Newbler v2.6 and SSPACE v1.1, the filtered reads were assembled de novo to 1,999,602-bp and 1,829,341-bp circular sequences in C. capsularis and C. olitorius, respectively. Both the mitogenomes were annotated using Mitofy, with an E-value cut-off of 10- 6, and the ORFs were identified by specifying start codons as ATG and ACG using CLC genomics workbench V6. C. capsularis mitogenome contained 37 protein-coding and 3 rRNA genes, and C. olitorius mitochondrial genome contained 35 protein-coding and 3 rRNA genes. As for tRNAs, C.
