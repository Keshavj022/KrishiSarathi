6 t/ha) by replacing with Swarna Shyamli, Swarna Pratibha (50-60 t/ha) Horticulture – Fruits   Fruits accounts for 6.01% of net area sown in the state and suffer with low productivity of traditional orchards because of poor quality of planting material.   Promoting Multitier systems for rain fed system (with Doba) like Mango based system in the existing 51840 ha under traditional orchards from 1000 ha to 2000 ha (Suitable for Sub zone VI)   Promoting Multitier systems for rain fed system (with Doba) like aonla based system in500 ha from existing 7900 ha (Suitable for Sub zone V)   Litchi based system 200 ha irrigated area from existing 5330 ha (Suitable for Subzone IV)   Promotion of high density orcharding in guava (25-30 t/ha) in the existing 8780 ha area of guava under traditional cultivation (8-10 t/ha) from 300 to 1000 ha.   Strengthening the nursery sector   Policy intervention by the state government to introduce the nursery Act Fisheries sector: Per capita availability of fish in Jharkhand is 22 g/day against the national average of 24 g and production of fish is 1785 kg per ha per year against the national average of 2150 kg due to the following constraints: i. Rain-fed Ponds, old & silted seasonal Tanks & Ponds, ii. Lack of quality Brood Fish, iii. Economically weak stake holders reluctant to use of factory formulated feed and iv. Climate not very suitable for diversification of aquaculture Steps to be taken:   Ensuring availability of fish feed by production at cottage level from existing 9000 to 30000 tons   Increasing fish production from 2.00 to 2,60 lakh ton by bringing more number of farm families under fisheries sector. 243 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022   Target oriented area expansion & coverage for Aquaculture through renovation of old ponds and digging of new ponds from 120000 to 140000 ha.   Introducing fisheries in newer areas by increasing number of beneficiaries from 128000 to 190000 Poultry: Most of the poultry population is under backyard management. Main constraint is low egg (120) and meat productivity (0.64 kg/animal /annum to 1.0 kg) of native bird and poor management practice under backyard. Steps to be taken:   Promotion of improved breeds of Chicken e.g. Jharsim (160-170), Vanraja (150), Gramapriya (180-200)for eggs.   Improved management practices for backyard poultry through regular vaccination and de-worming.   Ensure availability of improved variety of chicken (Vanraja-2.0kg meat/animal) for backyard by maintaining the parent stock BAU through financial support by the government schemes. Goatry:   Major breed of small ruminate is Black Bengal Goat under extensive management across thestate and has very low meat productivity (8.64 kg / animal / year) due to inbreeding.   Introduction (10+1 Black Bengal bucks per household), conservation and promotion ofpure productive (15-18 kg / animal / year) Black Bengal goat.
