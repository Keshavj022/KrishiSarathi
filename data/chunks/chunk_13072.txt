 According to Bye-Law 31, the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965 of the Government of India for the time being in force, have been made appli- cable to the employees of the Society, subject to the modification that any reference to the 'President' and 'Government Servants' in the CCS (CCA) Rules is to be construed as reference to the 'President of the Society' and 'Officers and employees of the Society", respectively. 2. The various penalties which can be imposed on the ICAR em- ployees are mentioned in Rule 11 of the said Rules. An important require- ment of these rules is that the penalties cannot be imposed by any officer on any employee but only by the officers so authorised by Rules, techni- cally termed as the Disciplinary Authority'. The disciplinary authority, therefore, means any authority competent under- CCS (CCA) Rules to impose on the officers and employees of the ICAR any of the penalties specified under Rule 11 of these Rules. 3. As per provision of Rule 12 of CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 the attached schedule of Disciplinary/Appellate Authorities for imposition of penalties etc. has been drawn up with the approval of President, ICAR in respect of various posts covered under A. R. S. and Research Management Positions. [No. 1-9/79-Vig. dt. 28-3-81].
