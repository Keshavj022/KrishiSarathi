 The plants’ leaf number, fresh weight, and dry weight in the 2 and 3% treatments were increased compared to the 1% and control. The results obtained by Islam et al. [113] are consistent with the work of Helliwell [116] and Tian et al. [117], where a biochar addition was found to be ineffective at promoting plant growth. However, applying the biochar at higher percentages (>3%) was found to have a significant effect on the growth of plants. This can also explain the insignificant differences in the results between the control and treated plants obtained by Islam et al. [113]. Banana peel biochar has been found to suppress chromium toxicity, promote iron uptake, and improve plant growth parameters compared to a control [118]. However, researchers have discovered that the foliar application of iron alone yielded even better results compared to a BP biochar. The effect of using composite biochar from different biomass sources could be studied. As Agriculture 2024, 14, 1894 16 of 24 previously mentioned, the process of pyrolysis used to synthesize biochar is controlled by various parameters. The synthesis conditions can be optimized to favour biochar formation in high yields. Researchers may choose literature-based values within a certain range for each parameter to investigate their influence on the formation of biochar and its properties. The response of these values can either be investigated manually or using several software tools such as Design Expert and Minitab [119]. When manually investigated, other parameters are held constant while one is investigated. When utilizing software, various sequential processes such as response surface methodology (RSM), etc., exist and are employed to determine the influence of independent variables on one or more responses [120]. In this way, the optimum conditions for biochar synthesis are determined. Using the central composite design (CCD) from RSM, Omulo et al. [114] demonstrated the optimization of biochar production from BPs. Slow pyrolysis took place in a batch reactor at a heating rate of 10 ◦C/min. The pyrolysis conditions were a temperature of 350–550 ◦C, a sample mass of 200–800 g, and a residence time of 45–90 min. Using these conditions, 20 experimental runs were conducted. The highest yield of biochar was obtained, 30.10%, from the synthesis conditions displayed in Table 7. Vinegar, tar, and non-condensable gas were also produced. Table 8.
