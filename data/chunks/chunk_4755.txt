 The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is playing a critical role in promoting sustainable horticulture practices in India. ICAR is spearheading research on developing drought-resistant and climate-resilient horticultural varieties. Additionally, research on organic pest management techniques and resource-efficient irrigation methods is being prioritized. ICAR is acting as a bridge between research and farmers. Through extension services, farmer training programs, and awareness campaigns, ICAR is educating farmers on the benefits and best practices of sustainable horticulture. ICAR is advocating for policies that incentivize sustainable practices in horticulture. This include subsidies for organic inputs, promoting the adoption of water-saving technologies, and establishing buyback programs for organic produce. Investing in infrastructure for post-harvest handling, storage, and marketing of horticultural produce can minimize losses and ensure fair returns for farmers. Global challenges require global solutions. International cooperation and knowledge exchange on sustainable horticulture practices can accelerate progress and promote best practices worldwide. Organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Society for Horticultural Science (ISHS) can play a pivotal role in facilitating this collaboration. The environmental crisis demands a paradigm shift in agricultural practices. Horticulture, with its emphasis on diversity, sustainability, and resource efficiency, offers a viable solution. By promoting research, knowledge dissemination, and policy advocacy, ICAR can empower Indian horticulture to become a leader in environmental stewardship. As we cultivate a more sustainable future, let us not forget the power of a single seed, nurtured with care, to bloom into a beacon of hope for generations to come.
