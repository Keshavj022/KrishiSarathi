Keywords: Control, Diseases, Pig farming, Prevention, Vaccination Indian Farming 73 (11): 25-28; November 2023 P IG rearing plays a significant role in the farming community in certain regions of India. The total number of pigs in India is 9.055 million, according to the results of the countryâ€™s 20th Livestock Census. Pig rearing provides a source of livelihood and income generation for many farmers in India, especially in regions where pig farming is practiced. Pigs easily transform agricultural byproducts, kitchen waste, and other organic wastes into high-quality pork. This helps farming communities reuse and recycle resources. Limited access to technical knowledge, inadequate infrastructure, and insufficient support services such as veterinary care and market linkages are some of the common constraints faced by farmers engaged in pig-rearing activities. Pig diseases pose a significant threat to the Indian farming community engaged in pig rearing, leading to substantial economic losses. To mitigate economic losses, farmers need to implement biosecurity measures, maintain hygiene, and seek veterinary assistance. The northeastern region of India is known for its pig farming activities, and pig rearing plays a vital role in the livelihoods of many communities. Efforts are being made by the government and veterinary authorities to implement disease surveillance, prevention, and control measures in the region. This includes awareness campaigns, training programmes, vaccination campaigns, and support for biosecurity measures to minimize the economic losses caused by pig diseases.
