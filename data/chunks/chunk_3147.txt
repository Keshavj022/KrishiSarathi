herbaceum cotton genotypes RAHS14, G.Cot.21 and desi hybrids G.Cot DH 7 and G.Cot.DH 9 were seen well adapted to coastal areas of the country with yield levels ranging from 10‐ 25 q/ha due to better physiological and biochemical adaptability attributes. Seed rate, spacing and plant population for different species of cotton in three zones identified under AICCIP.

Different chemical insecticides were tested against the cotton pests. Among these seed treatment with imidacloprid 70 WS @ 7.5 gai/ha, thiamethoxam 70 WS, Poncho 600 FS, thiamethoxam 350 FS @ 3 g ai/kg seed were found effective in controlling the sucking pests whereas lambdacyhalothrin 5 % EC @20 g ai/ha, karate 5 % EC @15 and 20 g ai/ha, spinosad 45 SC @ 75 g ai/ha and indoxacarb 14.5 SC @ 75 g ai/ha etc were found best against the bollworms. www.icar.org.in 6 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science Diafenthuron (polo) 50 SC @ 400 g ai/ ha has been found effective in checking the incidence of whiteflies Thiodicarb 70 SP (750 g ai/ ha) and Profenophos 50 EC (500 g ai/ ha) have been found most promising for pink bollworm management. The main components of IPM technologies developed for cotton by AICCIP are: • Deep summer ploughing to expose soil borne pests, pathogens and their destruction • Avoiding monocropping and proper crop rotation, selection of pest resistant cultivars • Using certified acid delinted seeds for good plant stand and preventing seed borne diseases causing organism and pink bollworm • Seed treatment with Imidacloprid to prevent the early season sucking pests and Trichoderma to prevent seedling rot • Monitoring with pheromone traps and assessment of pest population through scouting and ETL based application of appropriate technology to reduce the pest build up • Application of biopesticides (Trichogramma, neem, NPV) in the early phase of the crop growth.
