 A second direct photolysis experiment was conducted under simu­ lated sunlight using a QSUN XE-1 test chamber (Q-LAB, Westlake, OH USA) equipped with a xenon arc lamp. The irradiation intensity was set to 0.68 W. m−2.nm−1 at 340 nm to match peak solar irradiation, cor­ responding to approximately 1200 W. m−2 integrated over all wave­ lengths [25]. The temperature was maintained at 45 ± 5 ◦C. Profenofos photolysis was carried out in 500 mL pure quartz vials filled with 250 mL of pH 7 buffer spiked at 5 mg.L−1 of profenofos. Samples (7 mL) were collected at t = 16, 24, 43, 70, 137 and 209 h. Dark controls, covered with aluminium foil, were placed in the simulated sunlight chamber and sampled at the same times. All the vials were sealed with PTFE caps. Blank control experiments, systematically conducted to assess po­ tential cross-contaminations, were all falling below the limit of detection (LOD) and confirmed no cross-contamination. The incubation times were estimated based on a literature review [26]. 2.2.2. Laboratory soil dissipation experiment Topsoil samples (0–5 cm; n = 8) were collected in the field study plot in the Berambadi catchment on April 28th 2022, prior to the application of profenofos, for the soil degradation experiment. The physico- chemical characteristics of the soil, classified as red calcic Luvisol (FAO classification), are detailed in Table S-2. Background concentra­ tions of profenofos in the collected soil sub-samples ranged from < 0.05 µg.kg−1 (i.e., < LOD) to 0.1 µg.kg−1. The soil degradation experiment was conducted at the Indo-French Cell for Water Sciences, Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. Topsoil samples were pooled in a composite sample and then carted in six subsamples of 2 kg to conduct degradation experiments in triplicates. The experiments were set up in six clean, circular stainless-steel plates (30 cm internal diameter and 5 cm soil thickness), each covered with aluminium foils. Three heat-treated control experiments were conduct­ ed using soils that had undergone a triple heating cycle at 70 ◦C, each cycle lasting 72 h with 24 h intervals. This treatment was intended to limit microbial activity while minimizing changes to the soil physico- chemical properties [27]. Deionized water was added to achieve a volumetric water content equivalent to 20 % of the soil mass. The 3 biotic and 3 heat-treated soil experiments were spiked with a freshly prepared aqueous solution of the commercial formulation ROCKET 44 EC (2 mL.L−1) to establish an initial concentration of 1 mg.kg−1 in soil on a wet weight basis, reflecting realistic environmental conditions following profenofos application. The biotic and heat-treated experiments were incubated in parallel at 25 ± 1 ◦C (min = 22.5 ◦C, max = 27.5◦C). Water loss during the experiment remained < 7 % by the end of the study.
