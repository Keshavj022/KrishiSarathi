 Herbicides continue to be one of the most effective and easiest tools for weed management in India as well as world. Though there are growing environmental concerns over the intensive use of herbicides, Indian Farming January 2022 17 there is no better and effective alternative. Nevertheless, judicious use of herbicides for weed management has a significant place in Indian agriculture particularly considering large chunk of small and marginal farmers in the country. Pesticide use in India Table 1 depicts countrywise pesticide use in the world. Top 15 countries are ranked on basis of total pesticide use (as of 2017). China tops the chart with 17,63,000 tonnes of pesticides and per hectare usage of 13.1 kg, which is remarkably high as compared to other countries. The United States is the next largest consumer of pesticides. It used 4,07,779 tonnes of pesticides with a per hectare usage of 2.5 kg. Pesticides are so common in United States that even common citizens apply them to lawns, and municipalities use them for parks. India’s global ranking is 13th in terms of total pesticide use (52,750 tonnes) and the per hectare usage is just 0.3 kg. Both total usage as well as per hectare usage of pesticides is very much low in India as compared to other countries and the average data. In terms of per hectare crop land, India occupies 113th rank among other countries in the world. Further, if we look at the period from 1991 to 2008, overall decline was observed in annual pesticide usage trend in India. However, after a steep decrease from 37,423 tonnes in 2005 to 14,485 tonnes in 2008, the per year usage of pesticide in India has witnessed an increasing trend and it reached 52,750 tonnes in 2017. Though there was slight dip of usage in 2012 and 2013, an overall increasing trend could be seen in annual pesticide use in India (1991 to 2017). Volume of production in India: Herbicide vis-à-vis total pesticides It was indicated that total pesticide production has increased from 188 thousand MT in 2015-16 to 192 thousand MT in 2019-20. However, the highest production (217 thousand MT) was observed in 2018- 19. It was on increasing trend till 2018-19 and showed decline of 25 thousand MT in 2019-20 as compared to the previous year. Production volume of herbicides also indicated similar trend during this period. It was 33 thousand MT in 2015-16 and reached 39 thousand MT in 2019-20. Highest production (42 thousand MT) was observed in both 2017-18 and 2018-19. A dip of 3 thousand MT was recorded in 2019-20 as compared to previous year. Position of Herbicides in Pesticide Group Total pesticide production in the country depicted a compound annual growth rate of 0.56 during 2015-16 to 2019-20 (Table 2). Production of herbicides topped with 4.72% followed by insecticide with 1.57%. Interestingly, fungicides and rodenticides showed negative growth Table 1.
