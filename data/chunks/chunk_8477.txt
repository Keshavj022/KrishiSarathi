 Crop Production Rice hybrids PHB 71 and KRH 2 were found better than varieties in nitrogen- use efficiency (NUE) indices, like agronomic efficiency, physiological efficiency and nitrogen harvest index. Hybrids were found to maintain higher panicle water potential and also mean relative water content of primary spikelets, and the osmotic potential in spikelets decreased during grain-filling compared to varieties. These differences may be related to differences in grain-filling percentage. Continued physiological studies confirmed relatively poor grain-filling in bottom half of the hybrid panicles, lowering mean filled grain percentage. This is due to intense apical dominance in grain-filling in hybrids. Kharif yield response to P at 60 kg P2O5/ha (direct effect) was equivalent to residual effect of 90 kg P2O5/ha applied to rabi rice or 30 kg P2O5/ha each applied to both the crops. Crop Protection New combination insecticides, Acephate 45% + Cypermethrin 5% (Upacy), Chlorpyriphos 50% + Cypermethrin 5% (Nurelle), Imidacloprid 50 g + SUCCESS STORY HYBRID RICE ENHANCES PRODUCTION AND PROFITABILITY Five of the released hybrids KRH 2, PHB 71, Sahyadri, PA 6201 and NDRH 2 are high-yielding and are widely adapted. These are now being cultivated in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, Haryana and Goa on 1.5–2.0 lakh hectares. Impact assessment studies carried out have indicated yield advantage of 1.0 to 1.5 tonnes/ha by cultivation of hybrids over popular check varieties, grown by farmers. And the monetary profit is in the range of Rs 4,000–6,000 per hectare. Hybrid rice is also becoming popular in low to medium productivity areas of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

But during rabi, these differences were not seen. Greenhouse testing of transgenic IR 72 lines transformed with xa21 gene against BLB under artificial infestation using local (Assam) isolate of Xoo has showed significantly lower damage (score 3) as compared to the check TN 1. COST-EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENTS FROM CRRI CRRI manual rice transplanter. This costs Rs 5,000 and saves 80% in labour cost and 74% in cost of transplanting, and the output of the machine is 0.025 ha/hr. Six-row drum seeder. Its cost of operation is 90% lesser than manual transplanting i.e., Rs 250/ha as compared to Rs 3,750/ha in manual transplanting.
