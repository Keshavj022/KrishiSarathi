 Exaggerated presentation in executive summary needs to be avoided. • Each page of the proposal should be numbered. • Checklist needs to be part of the proposal. • The CVRC proposal should be scrutinized at the level of the Project Coordinator/Project Director before submission to the CVRC. PCs/PDs will give their opinion on the proposal to member- secretary (CVRC). 29. Any other pertinent information Any other relevant information which is important in reference to the variety, hybrid or parental lines of the hybrids is also required. 111 GUIDELINES FOR TESTING CROP VARIETIES UNDER AICCIPS Annexure-IV Morphological Features for Distinctness, Uniformity and Stability of a Variety of the Small Millets I.
