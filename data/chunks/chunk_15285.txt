 It is frequently employed for irrigation scheduling and entails measuring the water content or soil water potential. Understanding the dynamics of soil moisture and how it relates to the water provided for irrigation and plant uptake makes monitoring the soil’s moisture content in plants’ root regions crucial [151]. Soil moisture content can be measured directly or indirectly using various methods and tools. Gravimetric sampling directly measures soil moisture content, and indirect approaches include heat conductivity, water potential, electrical resistance, electromagnetic properties, and neutron count [152]. In addition, studies reported that several other techniques, such as satellite, aerial, and ground-based water sensors, are used to monitor soil moisture. These techniques are becoming more popular in the irrigation sector [153]. Islam et al. [154] stated that smart soil monitoring systems have gained considerable attention recently (see Figure 7 and Table 2). The data collected by these systems is gathered using various sensors to monitor real-time soil conditions. This information is then transmitted to a central hub for analysis and decision-making, which allows for optimizing irrigation schedules and fertilizer applications, ultimately resulting in enhanced plant yield and water use efficiency. In 2024, Comegna et al. [155] introduced a novel multi-parameter sensor-tailored method to assess soil moisture at various depths. The study highlighted that the Agriculture 2024, 14, 1141 21 of 40 developed monitoring system consistently exhibited strong performance over prolonged data collection periods and is well-suited for the continual monitoring of soil water status. Lloret et al. [156] presented an economical sensor for soil water status measurement to aid growers in optimizing irrigation processes. The research concluded that prototype 1, operating at 93 kHz, was the top-performing sensor. Furthermore, a power circuit based on ICM7555 was developed to produce the biphase signal for powering the soil moisture sensor, which can measure the water content percentage in the soil at the desired depth. In 2013, DeRouin et al. [157] developed an integrated passive wireless sensor to track moisture levels in sand. The sensor featured a printed spiral inductor embedded within the sand and housed an inductive-capacitive resonant circuit. Similarly, Kizito et al. [158] conducted a study using ECH20 sensors to assess soil moisture content, bulk electrical conductivity, and temperature across different soils at various measurement frequencies. Shamshiri et al. [159] reported sensors are made of multiple raw materials. However, low-cost sensors are not highly resistant to harsh environmental conditions like sunlight, strong winds, and wildlife. Consequently, integrating systems on farms presents challenges due to these natural obstacles. The maintenance of sensor components in a proximal network is expensive, resulting in higher producer expenses.
