 I find a significant with households increasingly cultivating high-yielding variety crops and subsequently investing in the complementary material and labor inputs required to grow these crops successfully. Results in Table 5 are robust to alternative definitions of the farm input variables ‚Äî in Appendix Table B9, I use the log of total ex- penditures for each of the inputs. Results are also robust to sample restrictions ‚Äî in Appendix Table B10, I restrict the sample to villages further away from towns (panel A), to eligible and incidental villages (panel B), and to eligible and incidental villages far from towns (panel C). Table 6 presents results on four outcomes that measure households‚Äô product market activity ‚Äî an indicator for whether the household engages in any crop sales, an indicator for whether the household engages in the sales of HYV crops, log crop value and log empiri- cal profits. I find a 15 percentage point, or 29 percent increase, in entry into sales of farm output among households that received a program road (column 1). Further, there is a 23 percentage point increase in households selling HYV crops, significant at the 10 percent level (column 2). The positive coefficients in columns 3 to 4 suggest that households possibly experienced gains in crop value and farm profits, though these effects are imprecisely estimated due to large standard errors. Remote households thus transitioned from subsistence increase in labor-days per cultivated acre utilized in chemical fertilizer ap- plication and weeding. The coefficients on other agricultural operations are positive though imprecisely estimated. Journal of Development Economics 152 (2021) 102686 12 Y. Shamdasani Table 6 Market activity.

I run the pooled regression in Eq. (8), restricting attention to ùõø1, the treatment effect on households further away from towns. Outcome in Column (1) is an indicator that equals 1 if the household sells any crops. Outcome in Column (2) is an indicator that equals 1 if the household sells any HYV crops. Outcome in Column (3) is log(crop value + 1), where crop value is the sum of values of crops sold and crops retained for self-consumption. Outcome in Column (4) is log(empirical profits + 1). Outcomes in Columns (3) and (4) are winsorized at the top 1 percentile. Observations are weighted using 1999 sample weights.
