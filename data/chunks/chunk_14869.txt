 Details about the research area The present investigation was conducted at the research farm of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research – Indian Institute of Soil and Water Conservation (ICAR-IISWC), Dehradun, India, which is part of the lower Himalayan region of the Doon Valley, has a subtropical climate. The research plots are placed at longitude 77.87◦E, latitude 30.34 0N, and elevation 516.5 m above MSL. For the previous 64 years (1956–2020), the average rainfall in the study area was 1614.4 mm, with the southwest monsoon (July to September) accounting for 80%. In addition, this region has around 72 rainy days. Maximum and minimum S.K. Kar et al. Geoderma Regional 32 (2023) e00616 3 rainfall, as well as rainy days, are observed in July and November, respectively. The warmest month is May, with an average daily Tmax ranging from 20 to 37.1 ◦C, whereas the coolest month is January, with an average daily Tmin ranging from 4 to 23.8 ◦C. Furthermore, the average daily wind speed varies from 0.7 km h−1 in October to 2.6 km h−1 in May. The average pan evaporation varies from 1.2 mm day−1 in December to 7.3 mm day−1 in May. The clear sunshine hour ranges from 4.6 h day−1 in August to 9.2 h day−1 in May. The climatological attributes for the research region were acquired from the ICAR-IISWC meteorological station next to the study field. Fig. 1 shows a map of the location of the observation site. The soil's average pH (1:2.5) was 5.68, and the average EC (dSm−1) was 0.09 at the experiment site. The most common soil texture class across the treatments was loam and had a nearly homogeneous soil distribution. As per the USDA soil tax­ onomy of soil order, the soil belongs to Entisols. Clay content varied from 19.29% (forest) to 23.41% (conventional tillage), and silt content varied from 41.72% (forest) to 31.52% (conventional tillage). 2.2. Experimental details The research was accomplished in 2021 in the long-term experi­ mental plot with four land uses viz. control [natural sal forest (Shorea robusta L.), conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and zero tillage (ZT)] located adjacent to each other in a rainfed system of north- western Indian Himalayas. Some portion of the sal forest was cut down during the 1980s and converted into agricultural lands. However, the conservation agriculture (consisting of zero and reduced tillage) experiment was established in 2011; before that, the land was under conventional tillage practices. The prevalent cropping pattern is wheat during the rabi season, followed by maize during the kharif season, whereas the forest consists of natural sal forest of 75 years old. Distinct treatments were structured in a randomized complete block design and replicated three times.
