 Breeding populations (RILs) for higher 100-seed weight are under development by involving EC 538828 (23 g), T 49 (8 g), JS 335 (12 g) and JS 97-52 (10 g). Five hundred seventy-six F3/F4- lines have been phenotyped and 2 SSR markers Satt 555 on LGK and Satt 453 on LGB 1 have showed higher frequency of alleles from EC 538828 in lines possessing higher 100-seed weight (> 13.5 g). High oleic safflower for diversified uses: Three high oleic varieties — ISF 1 (78.3% oleic acid content), ISF 2 (78.8% oleic acid) and ISF 3 (76.3% oleic acid) have been developed for the first time by introgressing traits from introduced exotic lines. Lipoxygenase-2 free lines of soybean: High- yielding lipoxygenase-2 free lines in diverse genetic backgrounds, using marker-assisted selection in soybean, have been developed. Further, lipoxygenase- 3 free lines using JS 335 and PI 205085 (lx3lx3) have also been developed. P1 and P2 depict amplified products from PI 205085 (lx3lx3) and JS 335 (Lx3Lx3), respectively. Lanes L1, L2, L3, L4 depict advanced lines Jlx3-1, Jlx3-2, Jlx3-3 and Jlx3-4, respectively, derived from JS 335 × PI 205085 and L denotes 100 bp DNA ladder. Pulses Forty-three high-yielding varieties of pulses, including 10 of chickpea, 11 of mungbean, six of pigeonpea, four each of fieldpea and lentil and three each of urdbean and horsegram and two of cowpea were released for different agro-ecological regions. IPM 205-7 (Virat) mungbean: It is an earliest maturing (52-55 days) summer mungbean variety, released for cultivation in irrigated areas of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, in newer niches of rice-wheat system after wheat and in rice-rice cropping after second crop of rice. It has a yield potential of 1.0-1.
