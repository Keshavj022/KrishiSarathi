 These are dual type hardy efficient egg producers even in intense summer (hot and hot-humid) conditions and also good meat producers. This will help in increasing farmers’ income by maximising production throughout the year. CARI-Gracy (Cross of Nicobari and CARI Red): Dual type coloured and a hardy bird suitable for tropical and subtropical climate. The production characteristics are age at sexual maturity, 170 days; 20-week body weight, 1,415 g; egg production (40 weeks), 85; egg weight (40 weeks), 48 g; egg production (72 weeks), 220– 230; and egg weight (52 weeks), 52 g. CARI-Nirasafed (Naked neck plumaged cross of Desi with WLH): The dual type climate resilient white plumaged cross was developed for efficient egg production in intense summers/tropical conditions. The production characteristics are age at sexual maturity, 155 days; 20-week body weight, 1502 g; egg production (40 weeks), 94; egg weight (40 weeks), 52 g; egg production (72 weeks), 220–230; and egg weight (52 weeks), 54 g. Duck Improvement of 100 g in 8 weeks body weight in S-1 generation compared to S-0 generation was observed. Egg production up to 40 weeks of age was more than 100 and was 182 up to 60 weeks of age. Heritability estimate of body weight (8 weeks) in S-1 generation of indigenous Kuzi ducklings was high in magnitude and those of conformation traits were moderate to high. Genetic correlations between body weights and conformation traits were positive and moderate to high in magnitude. Fisheries Breeding of fishes under controlled conditions • Picnic seabream or black seabream (Acanthopagrus berda) is of aquaculture importance due to its high economic and recreational values, excellent meat quality and ability to tolerate wide variations in environmental parameters. Achieved its breeding and seed production by induced breeding using salmon GnRH-analogue hormone. The fishes spawned after 36 hr of inducement and the pelagic eggs hatched after 22 to 24 hr at a temperature of 28 to 30°C. Fecundity was 0.25 million per female (450 g) and 86% of the eggs hatched after 24 h. Larval rearing was carried out with various live feed organisms such as Copepods, Rotifers and Artemia. Metamorphosis of the larvae initiated in 24th day post-hatch (DPH) with 9% survival. Picnic seabream or black seabream, Acanthopagrus berda • Grey mullet (Mugil cephalus), a high-valued commercial brackishwater fish, was successfully bred under controlled captive conditions for the first time in the country. Captive maturation was achieved using sustained-release of LHRH and 17-MT hormone implants. Attained maturation percentage of over 80% in females with oocyte LIVESTOCK IMPROVEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 71 diameter > 520 µm and in males with expressible milt. Larvae were reared in captivity with the survival of ~22% on a mixture of microalgae and other conventional live feeds. Hatchery- produced mullet seeds were given to progressive farmers for further rearing.
