47 g at 28 weeks and 54.04 g at 40 weeks of age in IWN strain. The corresponding egg weights in IWP strains were 50.2 and 54.14 g respectively. The same lines, maintained at the GAU, Anand, for evaluation of feed efficiency, yielded survivor production of 241 eggs in IWN and 232 eggs in IWP. The per day feed intake was 114 and 106 g, respectively, for IWN and IWP up to 64 weeks of age. A reduction in feed intake by 1.5 g/day per hen was observed in the current generation compared to the earlier S-2 generation in IWN line. At the CARI, Izatnagar, the phenotypic response of hen house egg production up to 40 weeks in IWG and IWJ strains was estimated as 2.14 and 1.73 eggs, respectively; and in the same order, for the age at first egg was -2.15 and -1.98 days for both strains. A statistically significant realized genetic gain for egg production was 1.80 to 1.37 eggs for IWG and IWJ. The commercial cross of CARI, ILI-80 yielded 276.01 eggs with an average egg weight of 58.4 g in random sample test that is comparable with most of the commercials available in the market. Various strain and breed crosses were developed, maintained and evaluated for their enhanced part record up to 64 week of age. Among the various strain crosses 4-way cross (JGHI) have produced the maximum number of eggs (238.85) followed by JG (234.07), GHI (229.37), JHI (221.45) and HI (221.31), while the breed cross (IWH × RIR) have produced only 218.11 eggs. The mean egg weight at 40 and 64 weeks of age in the various crosses ranged from 52.17 to 54.64 g and 52.72 to 57.11 g, respectively. At 64th week of age maximum egg weight was observed in The heat tolerant major gene i.e. Naked Neck (NA) was introgressed in broiler stock RURAL POULTRY GERMPLASM The need to sustain free-range poultry farming in rural, tribal and backward areas was pursued vigorously utilizing the germplasm developed for the purpose. Vanaraja, a dual purpose bird was the choice in almost all districts of Andhra Pradesh, some parts of Orissa and some north-eastern states besides Port Blair. Grampriya was popular in Kerala and West Bengal as a backyard layer with good egg production and moderate body weight. Krishibro, a commercial, colour broiler with excellent livability and good feed efficiency was provided to the user agencies. Germplasm was made available either as fertile eggs, day-old chicks or parent stock. Day-old chicks of Vanaraja (58,251), Krishibro (3482) and other (2957) were provided to rural masses through Animal Husbandry Departments, KVKs, NGOs, Agricultural Universities etc. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 100 the breed cross (57.11 g). All the strain crosses matured in the age range of 125.16 to 129.36 days while breed cross matured at the age of 140.50 days. The replacement stock of S-20 generation of Rhode Island Red (RIR) was reproduced from 40 selected sires mated to 160 dams with 87.65 and 87.66% fertility in RIR selected and control lines, respectively.
