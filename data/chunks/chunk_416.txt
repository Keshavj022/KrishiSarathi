 • Type of storage: Poor quality containers or packaging that are not airtight can lead to moisture uptake, insect infestations, and other types of spoilage. In India, the storage is conventionally done in gunny bags and metal bins. • Duration of storage: The longer the millets are stored, the higher the risk of storage losses. • Handling and transportation: Proper handling and transportation practices are important to prevent physical damage to the millets, which can lead to secondary damages later. Among various abiotic and biotic factors, insects can cause significant damage to millets during storage. They can feed on the grains, contaminating them with excreta, and making them susceptible to fungal growth and mould infestation. Consumption of millets by insects during storage can cause quantitative losses, leading to reduction in the total quantity of grains. The feeding will also result in loss of nutrients, including protein, Millet storage in a warehouse (Raipur, Chhattisgarh) Indian Farming 31 November 2023 vitamins, and minerals. This can reduce the nutritional value of the grains. In addition, the infestation results in contamination of millets with their excreta and body parts, leading to a reduction in the quality of the grains. Infested millets may have a foul odour, off-flavour, and a discoloured appearance, making them unsuitable for human consumption. Physical damage is one of the most common quality losses caused by insect feeding on millets. Insects such as the rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae) and lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica) can cause damage to the surface of the grains, resulting in the loss of the outer layers of the seed coat. This can lead to a reduction in the size and weight of the grains, as well as an increase in the number of broken and fragmented kernels. The physical damage caused by insect feeding can also increase the susceptibility of the grains to mould and fungal growth, which can further degrade the quality of the grains. Insect feeding can also result in chemical changes in millets, including the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Insects such as the Angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella) can produce digestive enzymes that can break down starch and sugars in the grains, leading to a reduction in their nutritional value. In addition, insect feeding can increase the free fatty acid content of millets, which can cause rancidity and off-flavours in the grains. These chemical changes can reduce the palatability and nutritional quality of millets and make them less desirable for human consumption. Microbiological contamination is another quality loss caused by insect feeding on millets during storage. Insects can create openings in the grains, allowing moisture to penetrate and creating favourable conditions for mould and fungal growth. These microorganisms (especially Aspergillus spp.
