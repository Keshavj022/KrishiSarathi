) + Poultry(200 birds/cycle of 35-40 days) (for all the zones) Two acre model (lowland situation): Crops(6500 m2) + livestock (2 cows + 2 calves) + fish/ duck (1000 m2) (for all the zones) Makhana-based Integrated Farming System (Zone I & Zone II)   The different practices followed for Makhana + Fish + water chestnut system are:   Timely cleaning of pond,   Removal of carnivorous fishes and application of mahua oil cake (@ 2.5 t/ ha),   Transplanting and gap filling for optimization of crop density (@ 10,000 plants/ha),   Delineation of 10 % of the total water body area as refuge area, and   Integration of different carp species seed (@ 5000 numbers/ha as fingerlings of 10-18 g.   Half of the seeds of different carp species of Rohu, Catla, Common carp, Mrigal introduced in fixed ratio of 40:20:20:20 in March-April and rest half quantity of fish seed are introduced in the month of September after harvest of Makhana. The fishes are harvested twice: first in the month of September after the harvest of Makhana, and second in the month of December – January before the emergence of Makhana. Water chestnut is taken as third crop during the months of October – November. Strategy 3. Enhancing Pulse Production State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 69 Utilization of rice fallows (Zone-II & Zone- III A&B)   For productive utilization of rice fallows, a farming/cropping system approach should be followed.   Construction of water harvesting reservoirs and farm ponds to provide come-up / life- saving irrigation would ensure success of rabi crops and improve their productivity.   Cultivation of early maturing paddy varieties like Swarna Shreya, Naveen, Rajendra Bhagwati, Sabaur Ardhjal, Sahbhagi Dhan, etc. followed by early maturing varieties of chickpea (JSC 55, JSC 56, JG 14,Vijay, JG 315, and SAKI 9516), lentil (WBL 77, KLS 218, NM1, and DPL 15) and lathyrus (Ratan, Parteek, Mahateora). Introduction of short duration varieties of pulses can escape terminal moisture and heat stress.   Seed priming (Overnight soaking of seeds) and seed treatment with Rhizobium culture hastens seed germination and establishment under relay cropping, and 20-25% higher seed rate ensures desired plant stand.   Foliar application of 2% urea and micronutrients like Zn and Mo at flowering and pod formation.   Zero-till sowing with anchored crop residue of previous crop, to make the best use of available soil moisture, and also the nutrient placement. Impact Covering even 50% of rice-fallow area (say 1.10 million ha) under pulses in the next five years with a minimum productivity level of 500 kg/ha will result in an additional production of 550 tonnes of pulses in the State, besides improving soil health. Improving Pulse Productivity of Mokama Tal (Zone III A&B) Issue Mokama group of Tals consisting of 7 Tals in series (Patna, Nalanda and Lakhisarai districts) covering an area of around 1,18,000 ha.
