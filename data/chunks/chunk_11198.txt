Extension Division of ICARhas also launched two special programmes viz. Nutri- sensitive Agricultural Resources and Innovations (NARI) and Value Addition and Technology Incubation Centres in Agriculture (VATICA) for up-scaling the bio-fortified varieties through the vast network of Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) at district level. This kharif season is approaching in midst of second wave of Covid pandemic and therefore disruption in normal operations/ logistics usually undertaken during the pre-kharif period is likely. To cope with shortages in labour and timely availability of inputs at affordable prices, farmers need to enhance the use of on-farm inputs especially organic manures, adopt best practices for increasing resource use efficiency and reduce cost of cultivation. In view of this, ICAR has prepared agro-advisory for farmers for the early part of kharif season across the country in all the 28 states and 8 UTs covering major crops, livestock, poultry and fisheries. The agro-advisory and its regional translations have been organized for respective states under ATARI Zones (Zones 1 to 11) of the Agricultural Extension Division of ICAR. The crop, livestock and fisheries advisories mainly deal with best practices to be adopted by farmers during ensuing summer period and kharif season. The technical aspects covered in the advisories are related to seed, soil, water, nutrient and health management in crops and livestock enterprises. yy Selection of suitable crop cultivars in different crops and adhering to optimum sowing times for achieving higher productivity. For example, avoid cultivation of long duration varieties in transplanted paddy in Punjab, adhere to sowing windows depending on cultivar in bastmati rice and complete sowing of cotton by mid-May. Increase 4 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS in the sustainable practice of summer moong area (zaid crop) by 56% augurs well for enhancing pulses production and will benefit better soil health for succeeding kharif crop.
