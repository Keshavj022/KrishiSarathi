 In terms of cost, the ITK was highly effective than the allopathic treatment. Contents Code Title of the ITK Description of the ITK VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY : 1595 : Use of bantulsi {Ocimum gratissimum) leaf paste for treatment of khurha (FMD) in cattle and buffalo : Bantulsi has medicinal properties against FMD. Paste of its leaves is prepared after grinding it along with water and is applied on the infected foot of cattle and buffalo at least twice daily for 3-4 days. The practice is prevalent in Barmasa village of Jarmundi block in Dumka district (Jharkhand) and has potential for spread in the areas where bantulsi is available. Success has been reported in more than 75% of the cases.

Therefore it was recommended for cross-sectoral validation and in-vitro antiviral activity trials. Preparation of extracts: Aqueous and alcoholic extracts of bantulsi were prepared as per standard protocol and put to solubility test. Both the extracts readily dissolved in sterile distilled water. A 10 mg/ml stock of extracts was made in sterile distilled water and filtered separately using 0.22 mm filters. The filtrates were used for cytotoxicity in BHK2| and vero cell lines. Cytotoxicity study: Initially, different concentrations of the extracts were prepared in GMEM/EMEM with 1 % new born calf serum or bovine calf serum from the stock solutions. BHK21 or vero cells were grown to confluence for 48 hr in 24-well plates. Then the monolayers were washed with GMEM/EMEM containing 1% Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE NBCS/BCS and antibiotics. Later each extract concentrations in GMEM/EMEM with 1% NBCS/BCS in quadruplicates was fed on to the confluent monolayer with appropriate controls. The plates were incubated at 37Â°C with 5% CO2 for 96 hr up to 144 hr. The cells were observed at 24 hr intervals for cytotoxicity and the following changes were noted.
