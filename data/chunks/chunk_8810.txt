Crop Production Pearl millet-based cropping system productivity could be sustained by applying N 25-50% through FYM/vermicompost or super compost and 75 to 50% through inorganic N fertilizer with recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) in the succeeding wheat and safflower and 50% RDF in the succeeding soybean and safflower. Newly developed hybrids RHB 121, NMH 26 and composite MP 383 recorded 8-9% higher grain yield (at 90 kg/ha) over best respective check. Crop Protection Hybrids MH 900, MH 901, MH 943, MH 956, MH 960, MH 1014, MH 1019 and MH 1050 have been found with high degree of resistance to downy mildew. And MH 881 and MH 882 possess combined resistance to downy mildew and smut diseases. SMALL MILLETS Crop Improvement Nine varieties of different small millets have been released for cultivation. Crop Protection Donors for Resistance In the national screening nurseries, fingermillet accessions GE 5181, GE 5192, GE 5214, GE 5240 and GE 5253 recorded very low score for neck and finger blast, and can be used as the donors for resistance. Resistant varieties of foxtail millet for sheath blight are SiA 2679 and PS 4; of barnyard millet for grain smut are PRB 9402 and PRB 9602; of kodomillet for head smut are RK 87 and RK 390 and OLM 203; and of little millet for rust are TNAU 89, TNAU 98, CO 2. ● ●● ●● Nine varieties of different small millets have been released.
