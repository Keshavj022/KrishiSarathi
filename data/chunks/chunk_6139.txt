The land management and uprooting of unwanted vegetation by the farmer for establishing orchard reduced the species diversity. This improved the under-storey grass cover and gave additional income through the fruit plants. The ecological succession of the species brought out change in intervention of the horticulture crops in the area and maintaining the indigenous species on the same piece of land, the farmer developed a sustainable land-management system in terms of ecological bio-diversity, soil health, less soil erosion and economical improvement.

Through this indigenous technology of Establishment of grasses on terraced SALT and non-SALT areas Being a fragile and sloping landscape, the terraces were damaged by rains and snowfall even after 1 year of their construction. That means, Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE either the terraces are to be repaired every year, which is rather a costly affair, or stabilize the terraces so that they are not washed away by water. To stabilize the terraces, attempt was made to establish grass on the terraces (Fig 2). The fescue and orchard grasses were planted at 20x20 cm plant and 40x40 cm row spacings on the terraces during August 2004, which is a rainy season. The results of this investigation are summarized in Tables 6 and 7. These results revealed that there was increase in root proliferation, number of leaves and plant height in SALT area than in non-SALT area. Also grasses planted in lower part of terrace and trenches showed increased growth pattern than in the central part of the terrace (Table 6) Similar results were also obtained for two other productivity parameters viz. percentage increase in root and shoot biomass and number of leaves (Table 7). CONCLUSION Contour orchard farming and terracing are the pre-requisites of the steep-slope orchard raising, as has been tried by the discloser. To mitigate the water stress and soil-erosion condition due to steep slopes, management of the slopes through vegetative structures was found essential. This intervention helped in developing the ecological and economically sustainable land-management system. Table 6.
