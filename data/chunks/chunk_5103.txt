But allopathic medicine cured 50% cases in 6 days and all the animals were within 9 days. The hoof lesions were cured in 70% animals in 15 days as compared to 90% by allopathic medicine. Hoof lesions of FMD are more complicated and the recovery by ITK method (70%) is less than by the allopathic medicine (90%). Thus the ITK method reported by farmers for the treatment of FMD is suitable for mouth lesions only. The hoof lesions will take more time for its recovery. Phytochemical analysis The preliminary phytochemical screening of the brinjal dry leaves residue showed the presence of flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and steroids. ] In acute toxicity study the dry residue of leaf juice was found to be safe and no mortality was observed in mice up to a dose level of 4 g/kg. S. melogana produced antipyretic effect in a dose dependent manner. An appreciable antipyretic effect was noticed in mice which was comparable to paracetamol. The dry residue of S. melongana leaf produced analgesic activity. The use of S. melongana by farmers especially for tongue lesions of animals is meant for analgesic activity. Because in FMD the tongue lesions are painful. The analgesic activity of S. melongana may be due to the presence of flavonoids (Mutalic et al. 2003). In many earlier studies, flavanoids have been reported to exhibit antipyretic effects (Brasseur, 1989; Vimal et al. 1997). The antioxidant activity of S. melongana has also been reported due to presence of flavanoids and an anthocynin (Sudhees et al. 1998). Hence antioxidant activity of S. melongana may be one of the possible mechanism by which it reduces the pain and elevated body temperature of animals affected with FMD. CONCLUSION Treatment with camphor, brinjal, coconut and ghee in cattle is effective to cure mouth lesion totally and hoof lesion partially. REFERENCES Brasseur, T. 1989.
