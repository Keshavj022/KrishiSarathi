 The halophytes should be planted after the first rainfall in July so that surface salt on the soil may leach down to the sub-surface, facilitating satisfactory germination of the seeds. A row to row spacing of 45 cm for C. cretica and A. lagopoides and 60 cm for Sueada nudiflora and Sporobolus marginatus should be adopted. In monocot halophytes about 100 kg N/ha should be top- dressed after 45 days of the planting when sufficient soil moisture is available in the root zone (Table 1). However, no response to phosphatic fertilizer on growth and fodder yield was observed. In dicot halophytes, no fertilizer application is required. Harvesting of halophytic fodder These halophytes can be either grazed by the animal directly on the field or can be cut and stored for future use. However, studies on nutritional quality revealed that ash and silica contents increase in the halophytes towards the maturity stage. In C. cretica, salt content in leaves increases after 45–50 days of Table 1.

Therefore, the best time for grazing or cutting is 50–60 days after planting. Under best agronomic practices, halophytes yield about 3–5 t/ha of dry fodder. Large area field demonstrations A large area (0.10 ha) field demonstration on 3 farmer’s fields of Kachchh district of Gujarat was organized during 2019–20. Sporobolus marginatus was planted through root-slip by adopting a row to row spacing of 60 cm in the month of July after the first rainfall. The soil was saline-alkaline with EC of 24.5 dS/m and pH of 9.5. The halophyte grew luxuriously and was harvested after 60 days of planting. On average, the halophyte produced 5.6 tonne/ha of green fodder and 3.27 t/ ha of dry fodder (Table 2). Table 2.

About 6.77 million ha area of the country is affected by various degree of salt accumulation. This area is expected to even increase further in near future, exerting more pressure on already limited cultivational land. Normally, field crops are highly sensitive to salt concentration and produce a highly uneconomical yield.
