 Vegetable pea/Field pea: Zero till cultivation of vegetable/field pea should be practiced. Sowing should be done with spacing of 30-4 0cm x 10 cm and seed rate @ 60-70 kg/ha ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 242 Apply lifesaving irrigation for better yield Apply FYM @ 2 t/ha + vermicompost @ 1 t/ ha during the time of sowing. Cole cops (cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli) and tomato Nursery should be raised in protected condition to avoid untimely rain and low temperature. The nursery site should be dry and free from water stagnation as well as high moisture in the soil. The nursery bed should be prepared by mixing well decomposed FYM or compost @ 4 kg/m2. 25-30 days old sapling should be transplanted with spacing of 40- 50 cm row to row and plant to plant. Transplant the seedling must be done in the evening and irrigate immediately. Apply FYM @ 7-8 t/ha + vermicompost @ 1-2 t/ ha for getting higher yield. Root crop (radish, carrot) Soak the seed of carrot overnight in water before sowing for early germination. Seed should be sown on the raised bed of 30-40 cm width. Apply FYM @ 8-10 t/ha + vermicompost @ 1-2 t/ ha for getting higher yield. Spacing for carrot- Row to row: 20-30 cm and plant to plant:5-10 cm and radish - row to row: 30-40 cm and plant to plant: 5-10 cm should be maintained for good crop yield. To maintain proper spacing thinning should be done after 10-15 DAS ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 243 Potato: Potato should be planted in the middle of October – middle of November for higher yield in rice-fallow to utilize the residual soil moisture. Apply well rotten FYM @ 12-15 t/ha along with vermicompost @2-3 t/ha in the line during the time of planting. Tuber size 40-50 g in weight should be planted with row-row spacing of 50-60 cm and plant-plant20 cm. One irrigation is necessary for getting good yield. Good moisture to be maintained in the field to avoid the red ants’ infestation. Livestock specific advisory Cattle and Goats Strict hygiene and sanitation need to maintain at the farm premises to prevent the incidence of diseases. Regular supplementation of mineral mixture @50-60g/day to adult cows and calcium to the lactating and pregnant cows @70-80ml/day/cow is very much essential for milking cows for getting optimum production and productivity and avoid disease occurrence. Follow good management practices related to feeding, watering, housing (clean, dry, well ventilated) and general hygiene to keep animals healthy. Calves should be de-wormed as early as 21 days with Piperazine against round worm @110-130mg/kg body weight. Adult cow should be de-wormed preferably with Fenbendazole @7mg/kg body weight. Ensure de-worming of goats with Albendazole @ 7.5mg/kg body weight. In case of pregnant dose, pregnancy safe anthelmentics (Fenbendazole 25mg/kg body weight) should be administered 15 days prior to expected date of kidding.
