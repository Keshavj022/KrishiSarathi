 This study examines the marketing outlet choices of fruit and vegetable producers in this region and assesses how marketing channel choices influence the prices they receive for their products. Utilizing farm-level data, the study reveals that local crop producers receive higher prices (13 to 73 percent more) when selling through mandis compared to private traders. In comparison, farmers of high-value export crops receive lower prices (19 percent less) when selling through mandis compared to private traders. This disparity emphasizes the need for tailored marketing policies rather than one-size-fits-all approaches for smallholders in development contexts. 1. Introduction Functioning institutions are an essential requirement for the market mechanism to act efficiently and to ensure that production factors are allocated optimally and that maximum welfare outcomes are achieved (Arvin et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2021). In the agri­ cultural sectors of developing and emerging economies (DEE), the efficiency of value chains plays a vital role in the incomes of small-scale farmers. Increases in efficiency, therefore, are crucial for alleviating poverty worldwide (Mishra, Kumar, and Joshi, 2021). However, institutions do not work well in many parts of the world, particularly in agricultural markets. Existing studies identify a range of institutional shortcomings in the agricultural sector, such as market power by agricultural buyers and further downstream (Grosh, 1994; Key and Rusten, 1999; Kopp and Sexton, 2021), asymmetric information (Winters et al., 2005), liquidity constraints (Ellis and Biggs, 2001; Swinnen and Maertens, 2007; Mishra et al., 2016), or high barriers to entry for intermediaries (Ba et al. 2019; Kopp and Brümmer, 2017). Particularly, the lack of secure land and other property rights (Dong et al., 2020) and contract enforce­ ability (Kebede et al., 2021) causes low levels of trust (Singh, 2002, and 2019). Such low trust levels can lead to risk adversity and low investments on the part of farmers, resulting in market outcomes that forgo the efficiency gains of completed transactions because Abbreviations: DEE, developing and emerging economy; GSMCs, government-supported marketing channel; PHC, pre-harvest contractor; APMC, agricultural produce market committee; FAO, food and agriculture organization; GoI, government of India; IFPRI, international food policy research institute. * Corresponding author.
