 NRCHB-101, NRCDR-2, DRMR IJ-31, RH-749 and RH-406 on farmers’ field covering four villages (Kanchanpur, Dhikauli, Koat-Baheta and Mavi) of Babina and Badagaon blocks of Jhansi district during Rabi season of 2016- 17 on the basis of a benchmark survey for assessment of prevailing cultivation practices vis-à-vis components of improved technology for mustard-rapeseed cultivation (Table 4 ). Farmers reported very encouraging response to improved technology provided to them, as compared to broadcasting. There was 40% of seed saving, optimum plant population and 20-40% higher yield and economic return (Gross, Net and B:C ratio) in line sowing with seed drill. Farmers were convinced that timely sowing can further lead to yield enhancement in mustard. Adoption of improved package of practices resulted on an average 30.9% increase in yield (1283 kg/ 17 Annual Report 2016-17 ha) over traditional cultivation practices (979 kg/ha) being followed by the farmers in the region. However, mean average yield of variety NRCHB-101 (1328.5 kg/ha) and RH 406 (1365.0 kg/ha) was higher as compared to NRCDR-2 (1297.0 kg/ha), RH-749 (1259.0 kg/ha) and DRMR-IJ-31 (1220.0 kg/ha). 8. Infrastructural Development 8.1 Development of Crop Cafeteria & Agricultural Farm In order to make students translate theory of crop production into practice and impart agricultural practical skills to students for decision making in real field environment, a crop cafeteria has been developed. The demonstration plots were developed at University farm by cultivating improved crop varieties of various crops by using seed material collected from different agricultural research institutions and universities and adopting appropriate agronomic/plant protection practices. A number of traditional field crops like wheat, barley, oats, various spp. of rapeseed and mustard, linseed, sunflower, safflower, chickpea, lentil, field pea, potato, berseem mung bean, urd bean, maize etc were grown in demonstration blocks during the year. The university aims to standardize suitable package of practices for realizing potential optimum yield of improved varieties/hybrids in Bundelkhand region. Emphasis is being given also on development of precision farming practices, germ plasm collection, post-harvest management and value addition in field crops. 8.2 Development of Vegetable Production and Demonstration Unit Horticulture is the fastest growing sector within Indian agriculture.
