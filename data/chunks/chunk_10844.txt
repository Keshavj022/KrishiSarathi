   To control maize stem borer use dimethoate 30 EC @660ml/hectare or carbaryl 50 WP @1kg/ ha.   Seed treatment of maize should be done with bavistin@2g/kg of seed before sowing.   If there is heavy rainfall, care must be taken for drainage of excessive water from the maize field.   Sesamum:   Spray NPK when the crop is 23 to 25 days old, if there is shortage of moisture.   Spray trichodermaviridi 1 gm per litre of water, if disease occur. Ginger   The correct time for sowing of ginger is April-May. Bed of 1 m width and 15 cm height is good for ginger planting. The distance between two beds should be 50 cm.   Ginger rhizome should be treated with pseudomonas flurosecenceortrichodermaviridi @20gm with 1kg rhizome. Carbendazim can also be used for rhizome treatment @ 2 gm per kg of rhizome.   Before planting, apply neem oil cake 2MT/ha, SSP 312.5kg/ha & MOP 41.6 kg/ha. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 118 Cucurbits   Seed must be treated before sowing followed by shade drying. Collect healthy and certified seeds from good/ registered source to avoid seed borne diseases. Follow recommendations of soil health card for proper fertilizer application. Colocasia   Distance between two bed of colocasia should be 60 cm.   Apply of 45 kg urea, 180 kg SSP and 100 kg MOP at the time of planting.   If there is blight attack, apply metalyxil 4% mancozeb 64% WP 500gm/ha or mancozeb 500 gm/ha at an interval of 10 to 12 days interval. Brinjal   Seeds of brinjal should be treated with carbendazim @2gm per kg of seeds to protect the crop from seed borne diseases. As a biocontrol measure, seed also can be treated with pseudomonas fluroscence or trichodermaviridi @10gm per kg of seed.   Before transplanting, apply 110 kg of Urea, 376 kg of SSP & 96 kg MOP per hactre. Spacing of brinjal seedling should be kept 60 cm both row to row & plant to plant.   For brinjal shoot & fruit borer imamectinbenjoyet 5% SG @ 100 gm/acre or dimethoate 30% EC @660 ml/ha should be applied.   To control shoot & fruit borer crop rotation with crops other than solanaceous crops should be followed as a cultural practice.   Pheromon trap 12 nos./ha land can be used to control brinjal fruit & shoot borer. Chilli   Chilli seedling should be planted at a distance of 60 cm x 60 cm in the main field.   Before transplanting apply 65 kg urea, 260 kg SSP and 40 kg MOP per hactre. Another 65 kg Urea can be applied 30 days after transplanting after loosening of soil.   White fly which is the vector of viral diseases can be controlled by spraying dimethoate 30% EC @660 ml/ha   Thrips may attack chilli. To control thrips spray profenophos 20ml or neem seed oil 50 ml in 10 litre water. Incase of severe attack, spray spinosad 3ml/10 litre of water. Fishery   While conducting any sort of fisheries activities, follow the government guidelines to control   the spread of COVID.
