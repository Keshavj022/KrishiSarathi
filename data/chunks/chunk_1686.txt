 The nitrate restricted the transport of arsenic in both soil and plant systems, and judicious management of nitrogenous fertilizers reduced grain arsenic status in phosphate-rich soil. The rumen bacterial strains were found to be capable of reducing arsenic load in the ruminants; and development of polyherbal product to mitigate the arsenic load in poultry birds was explored. A positive relationship between arsenic content in the diet and arsenic content in human urine could be established in instances where patients were provided with arsenic safe drinking water. 2.8 Scientific Utilization through Research Augmentation- Prime Products/ Panchagavya from Indigenous Cows (SUTRA-PIC) Unique innate-immunity genomic 65 Salient Achievements of the Projects signatures identification in Sahiwal, Gir, Tharparkar, Kangayam, Karan Fries and Holstein Friesian cattle using immunoinformatic: The whole genome sequencing of 18 pooled DNA samples identified 3,733 SVs across the breeds. Specifically, Sahiwal (SW) harbored highest number (762) of SVs followed by Karan fries (KF) (731), Tharparker (TP) (718), Kangayam (KG) (580), Holstein Friesian (HF) (578) and Gir (546). Maximum number of SVs belonged to deletion (1650), followed by insertion (1185), inversion (468), break-end (308) and duplications (304). The HF had highest number of breed-specific SV (59) followed by the SW (32), KF (25), TP (17), GIR (7) and KG (4). Maximum number of breed-specific SVs belonged to inversion (58) followed by deletion (48) type. Additionally, to understand the expression profiles of the genes in CNVs, peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC) were isolated from four cattle breeds (SW, TP, Gir and KF), exposed to a bacterial PAMP, LPS (1Âµg/ml), for four hours in-vitro, and their RNA was sent for custom RNA-seq. Further, an in-house pipeline was developed to identify the innate immune genes related to CNVs using the publicly available genome sequences of Nelore and Hereford cattle. This analysis revealed that 203, 113 and 38 genes had highest number of substitutions, insertions and deletions, respectively. Most of them are related to adaptive immunity. However, innate immune genes such as antimicrobial peptide NK-lysin showed CNVs. Isolation of proline-rich polypeptides from colostrum of select indigenous cattle breeds and evaluation of their nutraceutical potential: Amino acid profile and sequence of proline- rich polypeptides (PRPs) indicated higher proline content in colostrum of Sahiwal (24.5%) followed by Tharparkar (22.3%), Gir (21.91%), HF (18.25%) and Karan Fries (17.49%). De-nova sequencing of the peptides was done through LC-MS/MS for PRPs isolated from colostrum of Sahiwal and HF and annotated with UNIPORT data base. Total number of peptides identified were 2199 and 2724, respectively in Sahiwal and HF. Out of these 26 and 33 sequences were annotated with UNIPORT data base, having expect (e) value less than 10-3. Most of the annotated sequences located to caseins (69.
