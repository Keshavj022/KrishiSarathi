 Flour from four sorghum cultivars — M35-1, CSH13R, DSV4, CSH23— was used as substitution for wheat flour in 70:30 proportion. The biscuits were evaluated for physico- chemical and textural properties and sensory tests. CSH13R and M35-1 were found best suitable cultivars when compared with 100% wheat, as their overall score was 7.2%. The biscuits prepared with cultivars CSH13R and M35-1 were with desirable qualities; CSH13R being a hybrid offers a better choice to the industry in terms of lower cost of production, to the tune of 15- 25%.

Interspecific crosses segregating for tillering and branching were advanced. A teosinte-plant with twelve branches was obtained by selection and inbreeding. Efforts would be made to develop a population with this trait to improve total green fodder yield. A stay green line (SGM 14-1) was selected having physiological mature cob and plant with green foliage and stem.
