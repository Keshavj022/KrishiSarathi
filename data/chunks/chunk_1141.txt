) is the second most important species locally known as Kathia wheat/Pasta wheat. In India, every year more than 2.5 million tonnes of durum wheat is produced from nearly 10-11% of the total wheat area. Durum is the hardest of all wheat varieties and is more adapted to hot and dry wheat growing zones of India i.e. peninsular and central zones. Durum kernels are amber coloured with yellow endosperm, which gives its end products a golden hue. Premium pasta products are produced from durum wheat because of its yellow endosperm along with high gluten strength and protein content. In India, durum wheat is preferred over bread wheat in making a number of traditional recipes like daliya, bati, bafla, laddu, churma, sevaiyan, suji-halwa, suji-upma, etc. The demand for durum wheat is increasing because of its suitability to make unique food products and increasing consumption of these food products with rapid urbanization. Durum wheat cultivation has several advantages to offer like saving irrigation water due to its high water- use efficiency, minimizing the risk of rust epidemics because of its diverse rust resistance, providing naturally biofortified health food due to its high protein and micronutrient content. HI 8498 (Malav Shakthi) which was released in 1999, was the only popular durum wheat variety under irrigated, timely sown conditions in central zone. To enhance and diversify the durum wheat cultivation, there was an urgent need for new durum wheat varieties with high yield, disease resistance and quality. ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Regional Station, Indore developed a durum wheat variety HI 8713 (Pusa Mangal) from an indigenous cross HD 4672/PDW 233. HI 8713 was evaluated for 3 years under All India Co-ordinated Wheat and Barley trials (AICW&BIP) from 2009-2012 for yield, quality and adaptability among 37 locations of central wheat growing zone of the country (Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Kota and Udaipur divisions of Rajasthan and Jhansi division of Uttar Pradesh). Significantly higher yield, disease resistance, quality, adaptability and plasticty of HI 8713 to sowing conditions led to the release of Pusa Mangal by Central Sub-Committee on Crop Standards, Notification and Release of Varieties for Agricultural Crops (CVRC), Government of India for commercial cultivation under timely sown, irrigation conditions of central zone in 2013. Indian Farming January 2022 3 Performance of HI 8713 in AICWI&BIP trials HI 8713 was tested for 3 years during rabi 2009-12 in 37 locations of central zone along with checks. HI 8713 recorded mean yield of 52.3 q/ha and showed superiority over checks by giving 4.8-5.7% higher yield over durum wheat checks: HI 8498 and MPO 1215; and 1.5-19.3% yield superiority over bread wheat checks: Lok-1, GW 322 and PBW 343 (Table 1).
