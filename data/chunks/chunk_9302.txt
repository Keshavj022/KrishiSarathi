 The cooperative is managed to run based on Gandhiji’s principles and no money is taken from any government. 4. Improvement of Indigenous Cattle: Contributions of ICAR The ICAR-Central Institute for Research on Cattle (CIRC), Meerut erstwhile known as Project Directorate on Cattle has been implementing the Indigenous Breeds Project (IBP) under the All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Cattle for the conservation and genetic improvement of important indigenous cattle breeds of the country. The project is being operated by establishing germplasm (GP) units and associated herds are data recording units in the native tracts of indigenous breeds are maintained under farm and field conditions in collaboration with the SAUs, State AH Departments and NGO. Under the IBP, initially Hariana and Ongole breeds of cattle were taken up for improvement. The genetic improvement of Ongole cattle was undertaken in collaboration with Livestock Research Station at Lam under Shri Venketeshwara Veterinary University (SVVU), Andhra Pradesh from 1988 to March 2014 and 73 bulls were evaluated through field progeny testing (FPT). A total of 1.85 lakhs of frozen semen doses were supplied to farmers. Draft studies were also undertaken on Ongole animals by using single harness plough with digital dynamometer. The breed is suitable for draught work and its draught power varied from 0.60 to 0.72 HP among the bull Genetic improvement of Hariana cattle was undertaken in collaboration with the CCS Haryana Agriculture University, Hisar Improvement of Indigenous Cattle: Gandhian Perspectives 30 Mahatma Gandhi’s Vision of Agriculture: Achievements of ICAR (1989 to 2009). Hariana bullocks had capacity to pull moderate load of 8 quintals for about 2 hours without showing any serious effect on the physiological status. Since the year 2010, genetic improvements of Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal breeds in their home tracts have been undertaken by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in collaboration with State Agricultural/Veterinary Universities and ICAR institutes. The data recording of Gir and Kankrej cows is being done by involving the farmers and registering their animals in the respective home tracts (Gujarat) whereas, the data recording units of Sahiwal breed are located at GADVASU, Ludhiana, LUVAS, Hisar and GBPUA&T, Pantnagar. About13557 Gir, 6200 Kankrej and 813 Sahiwal cows from the farmers/Organized herds were registered. Total 219823 frozen semen doses of Gir, 143482 of Kankrej and 174172 of Sahiwal cattle were produced out of which 62494, 46936 and 106522 semen doses of respective breeds have been utilized/ sold since inception for AI in the farm and the field to augment milk production. A total of 160708, 71436 and 88642 semen doses of Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal, respectively, are available for future breeding. The improved females calves of Gir (5490), Kankrej (2743) and Sahiwal (1003) breeds were produced.
