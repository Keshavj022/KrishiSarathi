 Based on the spatial soil information, suitability of major crops was assessed using the analytical hierarchical process in the GIS environment, to suggest a crop plan and soil- based management measures to improve land productivity within the limitations of bio- physical factor and available resource. The proposed crops are Groundnut/Cluster bean/ Pulses/Pearl millet/ Sorghum for Bikaner and Churu districts. Most suitable crop combinations for Sri Ganganagar are Cluster bean/ Pulses/Pearl millet/Sorghum or Cotton/Groundnut/Cluster bean/Pulses. Cluster bean/ Pulses/Pearlmillet/Sorghum and Cotton/Cluster bean/ Pulses/Pearl millet/Sorghum are suggested for Hanumangarh district during kharif season. Similarly, for rabi season, Taramira/Mustard/Chickpea is proposed as the most suitable crop plan for Bikaner and Churu districts, whereas Barley/ Mustard/Oat and Chickpea/ Taramira/Mustard/Barley are the major crop plan for Sri Ganganagar and Hanumangarh, respectively. Land resource inventory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands: Similarly, land resource inventory at 1:10,000 scale covering the arable lands of the North and Middle Andaman district was prepared. About 2.5% of the area is under agricultural lands, 0.60% under plantation and tree clads and about 2% area is under homestead farming. Valley and coastal plain are the major landforms. Mudflat occupies 0.80% of area confined in Baratang (Rangat block) and Shyamnagar (Diglipur block) areas. Soil suitability assessment indicated that 65.0% area could be used to Digital maps of key physical properties of soil samples Digital maps of key chemical properties of soil samples ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 100 SOIL AND WATER PRODUCTIVITY Agricultural land use plan for Bikaner division with the help of latest data in climate, terrain and soil parameters in the GIS based multi-criteria model. The maps were finalized and validated. This will greatly improve the resource-use efficiency and productivity. Development of soil spectral library: More than 3,500 soils were characterised for their spectral signature Soil-site suitability map for arecanut grow arecanut while 72.0% area is suitable for cultivating coconut. Soil-site suitability for Pomegranate: Suitability maps for pomegranate for 15 states have been revised Revised soil-site suitability maps of pomegranate from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. The predicted models for soil properties were developed using Partial least square regression. The most relevant wavelengths for differentiating soil properties in the soils of the study area were found to be 560 and 1900 nm in the case of clay content, 2,220 nm in the case of pH, 2,250 and 480 nm in the case of SOC, and 380 and 420 nm for CaCO3. This information can be used for faster characterisation of soil properties.
