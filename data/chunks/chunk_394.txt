Rice-Potato-Green gram sequence Rice-Berseem-Maize Rice-Mustard-Sudan fodder Rice-Cabbage-Cowpea Cropping system diversified with high-value crops (Author’s field). Productivity The economic produce of different crops in different systems must be converted into rice equivalent yield (REY) for a more accurate comparison of cropping systems, taking into account the economic value of each crop and Indian Farming 15 November 2023 Advantages of cropping system diversified with high value crops. its market price. Addition of high-value vegetable crops in the cropping system enhances overall productivity of the system in terms of rice equivalent yield owing to the higher market price of the high- value crops as well as their higher production potential. In a field study at Varanasi, it was registered that high-value rice-potato- lady’s finger gave highest system productivity followed by high-value rice-capsicum-vegetable cowpea, which was nearly 55%, 54% and 57%, 56% higher than conventional rice-wheat and rice-mustard system, respectively (Table 2). However, vegetable crops are harvested at higher moisture content and yield is measured in fresh weight basis that leads to higher yield and productivity. Table 2. Rice equivalent yield (REY) of different cropping systems Treatment REY of rainy crop (kg/ha) REY of winter crop (kg/ha) REY of Summer crop (kg/ha) System REY (kg/ha/day) Rice (rainy)–wheat (winter) 3579 4478 --- 22.07 Rice (rainy)–mustard (winter) 3600 4097 --- 21.
