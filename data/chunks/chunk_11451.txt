 Seed Treatment with (Carbendazim + Mancozeb) or Vitavax Power (Carboxin 37.5% and Thiram 37.5% DS) @ 2 - 3 gm/ kg of seeds is recommended for better germination and breaking seed dormancy. It is recommended for basal application of Zypmite Plus as soil conditioner & use of Neem Oil and vermicompost under INM. Sowing of black gram and green gram should be completed by using Tractor operated seed cum fertilizer drill after harvesting of rice with available soil moisture to reduce seed rate, labour cost as well as time. Pendimethalin @ 1.5 kg/ha is recommended as pre-emergence herbicide for weed control. Use of Yellow Sticky Trap, Blue Sticky Trap is best under IPM. For control of Leaf eating caterpillar in black gram and green gram, spraying of Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG @ 80 gm or Profenofos 40% EC + Cypermethrin 4% EC @ 400 ml may be recommended in 200 litres of water for spraying 1 acre of land. To control Powdery mildew in green gram, Sulphur 80% WP @ 800 gm per acre is recommended in 200 litres of water. To control Yellow Vein Mosaic disease in green gram, it is recommended to first wipe out all the affected plants in the field ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 216 and then spray Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 66 gm per acre in 200 litres of water to control the transmitting vectors (White fly) of the disease. For control of aphids and white fly infestation, Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 66 gm per acre may be recommended in 200 litres of water. Mechanized harvesting and threshing may be followed on custom hiring basis to reduce labour requirement. Oilseeds Mustard Suitable mustard variety: Tapeswar is advisable to the farmers for better yield. Seed treatment with Mancozeb @ 3 gram per Kg of seeds is advisable to farmers for better seed germination. In Zn & B deficient soils, ZnSO4 @ 25 kg/ha and borax @ 10 kg/ ha should be applied respectively to increase the seed and oil yield. Irrigation is must at two critical periods of crop, i.e. flowering stage and pod initiation stage. Foliar application of water-soluble fertilizer (NPK 19:19:19) @ 8 gm /litre of water at flowering stage & pod initiation stage is recommended. Diamond back moth may be seen in mustard. Spray Fipronil 5% SC @ 400 ml in 200 litres of water per acre of land. Downy mildew disease in mustard cultivation can be controlled by spraying (Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP) @ 400 gm per acre in 200 litres of water. Groundnut Light sandy soil with good drainage facility will be suitable for groundnut cultivation. Procurement of seeds of Variety like Devi, Smruti sowing must be completed by November. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 217 Seed treatment with (Carbendazim 0.1% + Thiram 0.15%) or Vitavax power is recommended. Sodium or ammonium molybdate @ 3g/10 kg kernel may be added along with bacterial culture. Advisable to sow the crop with a pre-sowing irrigation, or else apply one post sowing irrigation to facilitate germination.
