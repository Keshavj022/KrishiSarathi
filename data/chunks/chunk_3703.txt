Tubers are abundant in their diet in a variety of forms as secondary staples, nutritional adjuncts (boiled/ fried/dried) and curative medicines. Taro is the major vegetable crop in most of the NE states. Tuber crops are consumed as food after boiling/ cooking by human and as feed for animal. In colocasia, leaves, young shoots and corms are used for consumption. Taro has a good range of vitamins and minerals. The corm is boiled, baked, fried or cooked in curries. The leaves are generally not eaten but traditional communities cook these like any green vegetable. In sweet potato, the tuberous roots are consumed which are sweet in taste and rich in starch. The tuberous roots or the tubers are important mostly as food item and is consumed mostly after boiling and backing in fire. The sweet potato vines serve as a nutritive and palatable feed for cattle. The unmarketable and poorly developed tubers are utilized as animal feed. Sweet potato and cassava tubers, colocasia corms and petioles are chopped, boiled and fed to the pig. However, sweet potato vines and cassava leaves are also fed to cattle and pigs.

Sometimes, leaves and young shoots of colocasia are sliced, sun dried and kept in storage to be used in traditional dishes during off seasons.
