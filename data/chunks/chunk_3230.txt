New technologies developed during last 5 years • Technology of harvesting at Physiological maturity and artificial drying Application/Use: By harvesting at physiological maturity and artificial drying,farmers double the profit. If harvested and stored by conventional means, the produce gets deteriorated • Description/Features of the technology developed: Crops from the fields in sorghum growing 4 districts were selected for harvesting. One‐ half of the crop was harvested at physiological maturity and artificially dried in order to prevent the grain deterioration; the other half was harvested at the normal maturity and sun‐dried (farmers' practice). Market price was ascertained for the produce from both the treatments. Significant improvement in grain quality (grain deterioration score was reduced to 2.1 from 4.0) and also the market price of the produce (on an average 55% increase in market price) were observed by the use of this technology. Description of the Equipment: • Equipment: Low cost community drier (steel fabricated structure) • Raw material: 5 tonnes sorghum crop/ batch for (3 hours/batch). • Land: 50 x 40 x 20 feet • Cost of instrument: 2 lakhs/drier. • Man power: 2 labor / batch. Commercialization status • 3 numbers of such community driers are under fabrication, one number in each of the districts of Mahabubnagar, Parbhani and Dharwad. www.icar.org.in 125 2002 ‐ 2007 All India Network Project on Jute and Allied Fibres 1.
