 A total of 1,583 serum samples (sheep 272, goat 868, cattle 164, swine 126 and human 153) collected from more than 10 states were screened for Leptospira and provided the diagnostic reports. Of the 1,167 samples from South India screened for leptospirosis, the seropositivity of 46.32% in sheep and 38.13% in goats was estimated, whereas 9% (14/153) in cattle and 38.5% (59/153) in human from Gujarat was observed. Sero-prevalence of economically important viral disease: The national serosurvey was carried out to estimate the burden of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), an emerging viral disease of pig in India. The mean sero-positivity was 22.1% (1346/6089). The seroprevalence of the disease was 24.17% in NE region of the country. Similarly, the burden of CSF was estimated to be 36.6% nationally. A total of 15,812 samples of sheep and goat serum collected from 18 states were screened for PPRV antibodies which showed that the population immunity was high in the states with regular vaccination programme. The burden of emerging zoonotic disease, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was also estimated by sero-survey with findings of mean apparent prevalence of 9.53% in goats and 13.86% in sheep. A total of six serotypes of bluetongue virus, viz. 1, 2, 5, 16, 23 and 24 were detected in Karnataka out of 150 isolates isolated during the year. Anti-microbial resistance: AMR study from 256 isolates covering animal, foods of animal origin, aquaculture, environment and human hospital settings were sequenced using WGS approach. A total of 14 sequences were submitted to NCBI-GenBank with the accession numbers. The preliminary analysis revealed that Staphylococcus aureus ST 772 is epidemiologically important in animal and aquaculture as in human. The genetic characterization of AMR bacterial isolates from Karnataka and Assam revealed a high prevalence of methicillin resistance in dairy environment. Three genomes of Pasteurella multocida of sheep origin were also sequenced and submitted to GenBank. Escherichia coli ST131 was identified as epidemiologically important in Indian context in one-health environment. Diagnostics Diagnostics released: ICAR-NIVEDI, Bengaluru developed and launched two effective kits, namely Diagnostic kits developed by ICAR–NIVEDI LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 79 Surravey-Kit for population survey of trypanosomiasis and indirect ELISA for detection of antibodies against classical swine fever in pigs using recombinant Erns protein. Indirect ELISA based on four recombinant proteins (Ag1, Ag1V1, Ag2 and Ag2V1) for sero-surveillance of porcine cysticercosis and indirect ELISA using cathepsin B2 and B5 for fasciolasis in cattle and buffaloes were also standardized. The patent applications for ‘Competitive ELISA for the differential diagnosis of brucellosis infected from vaccinated animals’ and ‘Recombinant Leptospiral surface antigen-based immuno-diagnostic test for Leptospirosis’ were filed.
