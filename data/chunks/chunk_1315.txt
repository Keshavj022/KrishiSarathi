 Baseline survey revealed that the economic sustainability of mango cultivation is being progressively threatened by shifting climatic conditions, emerging pest patterns, excessive agrochemical use, and a lack of processing infrastructure, which have reduced profitability. In the Siyana cluster in the Saharanpur district, focusing on Chousa mango growers, the baseline survey highlighted significant challenges. The majority of mango orchards are 55-70 years old, suffering from branch drying, followed by tree wilting. Major issues identified in Siyana include branch drying, soil nutrient management, Indian Farming 15 October 2024 irregular bearing, shoulder browning disease, safe harvesting, post-harvest losses, marketing, and nominal profit. Producing A-grade, disease-free mangoes with uniform colour, firm pulp, residue-free, and spotless fruits is essential for distant and export markets. While the role of fruit bagging in mango production has already been validated, large-scale adoption of bagging technology has not yet occurred in Uttar Pradesh. ICAR- CISH, in collaboration with MIDH, Government of Uttar Pradesh, has promoted large-scale adoption of bagging technology in the Malihabad and Siyana mango clusters. Mango bagging technology Bagging technology involves covering mango fruits with specially designed bags to protect them from biotic factors like pests and abiotic factors like weather conditions. This technique creates a favourable microclimate inside the bag, leading to improved fruit quality both externally and internally while safeguarding the fruit during critical stages of growth and development. The recommended bag sizes are 37.5 cm × 30.0 cm (L × W) for larger fruit bunches and 30.0 cm × 20.0 cm (L × W) for smaller bunches. These bags are made from double-layered craft paper, offering durability and protection against environmental factors. The outer layer is light-coloured, such as brown or beige, to reflect sunlight and is waterproof, while the inner layer is black to block sunlight and prevent excessive heat buildup. The design includes a broader base to enclose as many fruits as possible within a bunch, with bags tied with attached wire or thread around the bunch. The bags allow limited air circulation, maintaining humidity for proper ripening conditions. Additionally, the bags act as a barrier against pests like fruit flies and protect the fruit from sunburn, rain, dust, and wind. However, this method is not recommended for mango varieties that naturally develop an attractive red colour during ripening, as the bags may inhibit the colouration process. The best time to start bagging mango fruits is when the fruit reaches a size of 2-3 cm in diameter. Once bagged, the fruits should be harvested 50-70 days later. This method helps increase fruit size by 25 to 30%, making the mangoes juicier and improving their overall quality. Furthermore, the fruits develop better physical characteristics, making them suitable for export.
