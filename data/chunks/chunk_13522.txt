 It should be noted that data for all 43 crop residues were not fully available, and therefore we have made some assumptions within crop residues from the same family crops, as mentioned below in Table 2. The total annual syngas production potential for the whole country with 43 crop residues is estimated to be 327.1621 MT. At individual crop type levels, sugarcane has the highest syngas production potential (80.90 MT), followed by rice (61.16 MT), wheat (47.96 MT), banana (28.10 MT), cotton (19.405 × 109 Nm3), coconut (15.54) and so on. In terms of the crop residue types, the top 7 highest syngas-producing crop residues are sug- arcane bagasse (76.82 MT), rice straw (44.73 MT), wheat straw (31.69 MT), banana waste (28.10 MT), mustard stalk (17.25 MT), rice husk (16.43 MT) and wheat pod (16.27 MT). Considering the region-wise annual production of syngas for the year 2017–18, Uttar Pradesh has the highest estimated po- tential (68.36 MT), followed by Maharashtra (35.84 MT), Madhya Pradesh (28.29 MT), Karnataka (21.42 MT), Gujarat (20.74 MT), Rajasthan (20.63 MT), Punjab (18.61 MT) and so on. States with high sugarcane, rice, wheat, banana, and cotton production have comparatively higher production potential for syngas than other states, as the respective surplus residue potential is also high. The lowest potential of syngas production was found for Chandigarh (0.000131 × 109 Nm3). Among the northeastern states, Assam has the highest syngas production potential (4.888 × 109 Nm3). Fig. 4 shows the comparison between the gross residue produc- tion potential and syngas production potential (from surplus crop residue). This gives a better understanding of the amount of gross residue available and the actual amount of syngas that can be generated. The national syngas production potential is almost 37.64% of India’s total gross residue potential. The H2/CO ratio and the gasification efficiency for each crop residue syngas production are mentioned in Table 2. The H2/CO ratio ranges from 1.78 (for small millet stalk, bajra stalk, and ragi straw) to 1.02 (for Jute & Mesta). The highest gasification efficiency is seen for Tur stalk (54.77%), and the lowest is for banana waste (20.31%). In the case of syngas energy production in India, the potential is estimated to be 1.49 EJ, almost 30.52% of the total surplus bioenergy potential. The state-wise colour mapping (under the same scale) of bioenergy potential and the syngas energy po- tential in India is shown in Fig. 7. This clearly describes Uttar Pradesh as having the highest potential in both bioenergy as well as syngas energy throughout the country. 3.4. Methanol production potential from surplus crop residue syngas The methanol (MeOH) production potential is estimated using Eq. (23) concerning the syngas production potential. Considering the 25% conversion efficiency of MeOH from syngas (Yang and Ge, 2016), the national potential of methanol production is estimated to be 81.79 MT of MeOH.
