Agro-Eco Region 9: AER 9 in Uttarakhand comprises of Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar districts of Eastern Ghats under Agro Ecological Sub Regions (AESR) 9.1 & 9.2. Agro-Eco Region 14:AER 14 in Uttarakhand comprises of Almora, Bageshwar, Chamoli, Champawat, Dehradun, Nanital, Pithoragarh, Purbi Garhwal, Rudraprayag, Tehri Garwal and Uttarkashi districts of Western Himalayas under Agro Ecological Sub Regions (AESR) 14.2,14.4 & 14.5. Major NRM issues: AESR 9.1: The region is hot semi-arid ESR with deep loamy alluvium-derived soils (occasional saline and sodic phases), medium AWC and LGP 90-120 days in a year. Districts Land degradation Soil health & fertility Water related constraints Environmental constraints Haridwar Exclusively water erosion Soil deficient in N & B GW contaminated with NO3& Fe Deforestation & biodiversity loss AESR 9.2: The region hot dry subhumid ESR with deep loamy alluvium-derived soils, medium to high AWC and LGP 150-180 days in a year. Districts Land degradation Soil health & fertility Water related constraints Environmental constraints Udham Singh Nagar Exclusively water erosion Low in OC , Soil deficient in N & B GW contaminated with NO3& Fe Deforestation & biodiversity loss 109 AESR 14.2: The region is warm moist to dry subhumid transitional ESR with medium to deep loamy to clayey Brown Forest and Podzolic soils, medium AWC and LGP 150-210 days in a year.
