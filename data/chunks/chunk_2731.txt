00 The fourth term of reference to the Committee is to advise on the appropriate steps to be taken now in respect of the BNLA106 event, and the consequential development of BNBt and BtNHH 44 varieties, including identifying the person/s responsible. 7.01 All biosafety studies and field trials conducted with BNBt and Bt NHH 44 are invalid, as BNBt and Bt NHH 44 do not have the transgene sequences that they.are purported to carry in the applications submitted to RCGM/GEAC. If these lines are to be pursued further, fresh process would have to be made, starting at the level of IBSC (Institutional Biosafety Committee). 12 7.02 In view of the recent RT-PCR data on BNLA106 from NRCPB (refer para 5.05), the effectiveness of the event should be assessed before it is entered into the regulatory process. 7.03 Individual responsibility is normally reflected in the relevant paragraphs of this report. However, some of these are brought out in the subsequent paragraphs, either because of their salience, or because they may not have been stated elsewhere in the .. report. - 7.04 Dr. Kumar, P.1. of the NATP project, should have been more active in engaging himself with the activities at UAS. He should have been careful at the time of project - writing and not allotted molecular biology work to Dr. Katageri. He should also have ensured the development of event specific markers for BNBt. - - - - - - - - 7.05 Dr. Khadi should have been more careful, particularly as he had got the information from Dr. Kranthi on the presence of MON531 in 2008. In fact, Dr. I(hadi maintained throughout the enquiry, and even in earlier papers which were circulated to the committee by ICAR, that he did not know about contamination with MON531, whereas the contents of his letter dated 4.1.2012 addressed to DOG (CS) (Annexure-X; Pg.113) states otherwise. In this letter, Dr. Khadi states, in its third paragraph that "After the decision of GEAC on 02.05.2008 regarding commercialization of BNBt, following week of May 2008, Dr. K.R. Kranthi, HOD, Plant Protection, CICR, Nagpur informed me regarding the Mon-531 contamination I presence in the seeds tested". This indicates that Dr. Khadi was aware of the problem, at least in May 2008. Crucially, this was before actual commercialization of BNBt. He further states that "Immediately Hon'ble DOG (CS) and ADG (CC) were informed regarding the same. Hon,ble DOG (CS) arranged a meeting with all concerned Scientists and discussed the matter in detail on 21-5-2008 (Ref. F. No.2(1I) 2008 CC-1 dated 29.5.2008)" (Minutes at Annexure-XI; Pgs.114-117). However, in his discussion with the team that visited UAS, Dr. Khadi consistently maintained that he was not aware of conta~ination at that time and the proceedings of the meeting held on May 21, 2008, in which there is no mention of contamination, are correct. Also, Dr. P. L.
