The Naga hills are a part of the complex mountain range name the Arakan Mountain Range which falls on both in India and the Burmese sides. Mount Saramati is the highest peak of Nagaland, with an altitude of 12,552 feet. There are a number of rivers which originate and flow through the state.

It occupies about 61% of the total area under food grains cultivation and constitutes about 71% of the total food grain production in the state. Kharif is the main season of the state. Ninety percent of cereals and commercial crops are produced during this season. The yield gaps are associated with many factors such as quality of seeds and irrigated area under crop. Yield gaps can be addressed by expanding irrigation, use of improved seeds in sowing and better credit access. 20 Nagaland 390 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 20.1 Major constraints:   Lack of skill/ knowledge on improved farming practices   Fragmented land holding   Non-availability of quality seeds and planting materials   Inadequate irrigation facilities and storage facilities   Reluctant in adopting improved technology Which may be further hindered by   Poor credit mechanism   Poor agro-based industries   Lack of proper post-harvest technology   Lack of proper marketing channel   Lack of proper storage facilities   Improper soil and water conservation practices   Hilly terrain and poor road infrastructures. Besides cereals, horticultural crops, there are significant gaps in milk production and fisheries productivities also.
