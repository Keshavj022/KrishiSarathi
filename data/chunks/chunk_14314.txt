K. Nthebere et al. Heliyon 11 (2025) e41196 4 determined by spectrophotometry (λ = 420 nm). The content of moisture in soil was estimated duly following the protocol given by Wu et al. [41], and the information was employed to quantify SMBC and β-GaA. 5.4. Soil aggregate stability The macro-aggregates of 1.0–2.0 mm were deemed for examination because of sensitivity towards short-term agricultural man­ agement practices and also lesser number of years of soil treatment [42]. To achieve this analysis, soils were sieved prior as to retain the soil fragments of not more than 2 mm and, were kept air-dried until further analysis. 5.0 g of soil aggregates (clods) in replicates per plot were moistened by capillary action for 15 min and water stable aggregates were analyzed by wet-sieving method [42]. Table 3 Impact of tillage practices and weed management options in conservation agriculture on colonization of AMF (AMF-C), easily extractable- (EE-GRSP) and total-glomalin related soil protein (T-GRSP), organic carbon (OC), and water stable aggregates of 1.0–2.0 mm (WSA1.0–2.0 mm) after 3rd year in the 8th cropping (maize) cycle.
