 Improvement of germplasm: Two male lines of chicken, PD-1 (Vanaraja male line), GML (Gramapriya male line); two female lines, PD-2 (Vanaraja female line) and PD-3 (Brown egg layer line) were maintained for use in developing rural chicken varieties. In PD- 2 line, the egg production up to 52 weeks of age was improved by 2.2 eggs as compared to the previous generation. In PD-3 line, the egg mass up to 40 weeks of age was improved by 334 g over previous generation. Native chicken breeds Aseel and Ghagus were conserved and PD-4 (i.e. Improved Aseel) was under improvement program for higher body weight and egg production. Nicobari breed was maintained for evaluation of disease resistance. In PD-4 line, there was an improvement of 75 g in body weight and 4.14 mm in shank length at 8 weeks of age in S-7 generation. The genetic and phenotypic responses in 5 weeks body weight in PB- 1 (broiler male line) over the last 5 generations were 17.3 and 5.8g, respectively. In PB-2 (broiler female line), the phenotypic and genetic responses to selection for the 40 week part period egg production over the last 10 generations were 0.68 and 1.28 eggs/generation. Six layer lines (IWH, IWI, IWK, IWD, IWF and control) were maintained and evaluated. The egg production up to 64 weeks in IWH, IWI, IWK and control was 254.7, 258.0, 232.0 and 224.6 eggs, respectively, and the corresponding egg weight was 56.1, 55.2, 57.5 and 57.7g. The IWD and IWF lines were regenerated through random mating and the egg production up to 32 weeks was 51.9 and 52.5 eggs, respectively. Under the conservation mode, Aseel birds were characterized phenotypically with multi-colour plumage and dark red colour pea comb. The age at sexual maturity in Aseel was 219 days while the egg production up to 72 weeks of age was 59 eggs with an egg weight of 50.1 g. Broilers: The colour synthetic male line (CSML) and synthetic male line (SML) are undergoing long AICRP on Goat Improvement Improving goat productivity in farmer’s flock under different agro climatic conditions: Goat production is facing diverse challenges in different agro climatic conditions and it is necessary to carry out research and development activity to increase farmers’ income for better livelihood. The project is covering 13 registered breeds and 3 local genotypes (lesser-known goats) in different parts of the country. The project has contributed in increasing population growth, milk production and body weight. Preventive health care measures with farmers’ support have reduced morbidity and mortality in field flocks. There is a significant increase in the income of goat farmers and enhanced food security of all the stakeholders. AICRP on Goat Improvement is operational at 464 villages covering 3,010 farmers. The performance recording was carried out in 25,622 animals during the year. The increase in body weight at 12-month age over the units varied from 0.9 to 6.2%. Similarly, the increase in milk yield at 90 days varied from 3.4 to 8.
