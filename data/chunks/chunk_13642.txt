 It in- dicates that only a very few studies recognize the signiﬁcance of behavioural factors, which is one of the major research gaps in under- standing farmers' decision-making process for adoption of SAPs. In countries of South Asia, lack of extension services, knowledge, aware- ness, social networking and price ﬂuctuations were found to be the limiting factors in Bangladesh (Dhar et al., 2018; Sarkar et al., 2022); farmers' education, experience, institutional factors such as member of a farmer union, farmers’ organization and social networking in Pakistan (Mazhar et al., 2021; Jabbar et al., 2022); socio-economic factors such as gender, age, experience, education, extension services and market vari- ables like distance of farm from market in Nepal (Suvedi et al., 2017; Joshi and Dahal, 2019) are found to be the major determinants for adoption of SAPs. The studies in South Asian region also signiﬁes that the major focus is on socio-economic factors and not enough attention is being paid on behavioural factors. A detailed literature review table of these studies can be found in Table S1 in Supplementary data. Following this, we focussed on understanding how these factors (institutional, behavioural and socio-economic) have been studied in context of Indian subcontinent. In Indian context, farmers' educational level and attitude (Alonge and Martin,1995), perception of farmers about health risk and safety (Krishnaveni et al., 2019; Raza et al., 2019), socio-economic, market, and cultivation practices (Azam and Shaheen, 2019), social networks, information access (Mohankumar_2024), and awareness and educational level of farmers (Ashrit and Thakur, 2021), social networks (Chaudhuri et al., 2021) are found to be the prime de- terminants for adoption of SAPs. Literature indicates that majority of the studies have highlighted the importance of socio-economic and percep- tual factors in adoption of SAPs. However, in addition to socio-economic factors, a few studies have also highlighted the contribution of institu- tional factors i.e., policies, incentives, subsidies and various schemes towards adoption of SAPs. These studies signify that among institutional factors, social welfare schemes such as National Agriculture Policy, Na- tional mission on sustainable agriculture, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2020); co-ordination among various stakeholders such as farmers, labourers, policymakers, researchers, re- tailers (Srivastava et al., 2016); schemes such as Pardhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, minimum support prices (Chand et al., 2022), extension services and media (Paul et al., 2022), implementation of policies via various stakeholders (Rakesh et al., 2022), and beneﬁt from Farmer Producer Organization (Nikam et al., 2019) are important drivers for uptake of SAPs.
