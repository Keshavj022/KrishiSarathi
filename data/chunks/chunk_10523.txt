Agricultural growth and public investment 2.1. Growth-trajectory of agriculture and non-agriculture sectors in India The performance of agriculture depends on a variety of technological, institutional, and policy interventions. The effects of such changes are aptly captured by the growth in gross value added (GVA). The growth trajectory is examined here by estimating the decadal trend-growth rate in GVA. The trend growth rates are estimated for the 10 years starting from the decade 1951-52 to 1960-61 and extended to the latest decade covering the period 2010-11 to 2019-20. Further, the growth in agriculture has been compared with the non- agriculture sector to gauge the relative performance. The estimated growth rates for the decadal periods ending with 1960-61 to 2019-20 are presented in Fig. 1. 383 Investment, Policy and Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Fig. 1. Trend in decennial growth rate of agriculture and non-agriculture sectors in India Source: Estimates based on MoSPI data (2020) Between 1950-51 and 2019-20, the GVA (at 2011-12 prices) from agriculture and allied sectors has increased 6.7 times at an average annual growth rate of 2.7%. The growth, however, has not been uniform throughout the period. The decadal growth rate was 2.8% in agriculture during 1950-51 to 1960-61, which decelerated to 1.1% till the year 1967-68. Following the expansion of green revolution technologies across the states, agricultural growth accelerated significantly and reached about 3% by the year 1975-76. After a few years of deceleration, the growth sustained at above 2% during the 1980s and early 1990s. The growth, however, could not be sustained longer and witnessed a decade of deceleration during the mid-1990s to mid-2000s. This deceleration has coincided with the introduction of globalization and liberalization policies the country adopted in the early 1990s.
