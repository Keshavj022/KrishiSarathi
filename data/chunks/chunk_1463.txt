 These events can destroy standing crops, damage infrastructure, and erode soil, making it more difficult for farmers to recover between growing seasons. Soil-related issues It is another significant issue in India’s rainfed areas. In regions like Bundelkhand, where rainfed farming is predominant, high soil erosion rates have been reported. The erosion rate can exceed 10 tonnes of topsoil per hectare annually, which strips the soil of essential nutrients and decreases its fertility. In places where continuous cropping is practiced without replenishing the soil with organic matter or fertilizers, nutrient depletion can lead to a reduction in soil fertility by as much as 50%. This makes the land less productive over time, forcing farmers to rely on additional inputs, which many cannot afford. Furthermore, in areas like Gujarat and Rajasthan, where irrigation is used in rainfed fields, salinity build-up has become a concern. The rise in salinity levels, often by 1-2% per year, threatens the sustainability of farming, as it turns once-productive land into barren fields. Soil constraints in dryland regions significantly impact crop production, varying across different soil types such as black soils, red soils, and alluvial soils. Among these, alluvial soils face fewer challenges compared to red and black soils. One major issue is inadequate soil moisture availability. Low rainfall and poor organic matter content further exacerbate the moisture deficiency, making it difficult for crops to thrive during dry spells. In addition to moisture limitations, dryland soils generally have very low organic matter content, often less than 1%, due to high temperatures and the minimal addition of organic manure. This lack of organic matter negatively affects the soil’s physical properties, such as its ability to retain moisture, further stressing crops in dry conditions. Poor soil fertility is another concern, with most dryland soils suffering from deficiencies in essential nutrients like nitrogen and zinc. Pest and disease problems Exacerbated by climate change, pests have also become more frequent in Indian rainfed regions. Warmer temperatures and erratic rainfall have created favourable conditions for pests such as the fall armyworm, which has ravaged maize crops across Karnataka and Maharashtra. In some regions, pest and disease outbreaks have increased by 20-30%, causing substantial economic losses for rainfed farmers, who often lack access to modern pest management techniques. These outbreaks can reduce crop yields by up to 20%, leading to a cycle of poverty and indebtedness, as farmers are unable to recover the value of their crops. Pest outbreak Infrastructure needs One of the most pressing issues in India’s rainfed agricultural scenario is the lack of adequate infrastructure. Over 80% of rainfed farmers do not have access to reliable irrigation systems, leaving them vulnerable to the uncertainties of rainfall.
