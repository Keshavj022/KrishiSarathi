This bumper food grain production is primarily attributed to cultivation of high yielding crop varieties developed by the National Agricultural Research System (NARS) led by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Varieties are developed through crossing of suitable genotypes that possess desirable traits, followed by intensive selection for the target characters. ‘Phenotypic selection’ has been the mainstay of ‘traditional breeding’, which takes quite long time (10-12 years) to develop a suitable cultivar. However, the breeding cycle can be drastically shortened and selection can be made more directed and precise using ‘Molecular Breeding’. Here, selection of target gene(s) or quantitative trait locus/loci (QTL – genomic region harbouring the target gene or genes) also known as ‘foreground selection’ is achieved through tightly linked or gene-based ‘DNA/molecular marker’. Thus, the process is also known as marker-assisted selection (MAS). It allows the selection of desirable plants at early seedling stage, and takes only 5-6 years to develop a cultivar. It helps avoiding selection of undesirable gene(s) linked to target desirable gene(s). Combining multiple genes into a single genotype is more straight forward. Existing elite cultivars can be easily converted to an improved version using MAS. ‘Molecular Breeding’ has now become an integral part of the cultivar development programmes at ICAR institutes and State Agricultural Universities (SAUs). Using this modern technique, NARS has developed 74 crop cultivars in seven different crops. Sixty six of these cultivars were developed during 2015-22, as against eight varieties before 2014. These non-GMO (genetically modified organism) crop varieties are easily acceptable by the consumers, and are expected to play vital role in achieving country’s ‘food and nutrition security’. 1  Rice Improved Pusa Basmati 1 (Variety) Trait improved: Bacterial blight resistance 1.
