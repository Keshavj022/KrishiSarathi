 The proposed Project is also a multi-Global Practice collaboration (Agriculture and Education) and is expected to support activities and results directly related to cross-cutting strategic areas of climate change, jobs and gender. One of the focus of this project is to foster a stronger innovation culture by twinning participating agricultural universities with other higher-performing centers of learning (both in India and 29 internationally) and strengthening University-private sector linkages to better orient student learning toward market-relevant skill sets. In this endeavour, ICAR could help depute 308 undergraduate students and 93 faculty from Indian agricultural universities to foreign universities and research organizations for exposure and strategic interaction with domain specialist abroad. At the same time, the NAHEP has facilitated increased collaboration between Indian Agricultural Universities and other universities globally to raise research quality and its linkage to educational quality and relevance.
