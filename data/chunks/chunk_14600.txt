Effect of the extent of urban agriculture on food security in Ghana IJSE 48,3 448 As a result, one of the crucial motivations to undertake urban farming is to consume healthy food, free of pesticides (Ha et al., 2019). The study further revealed a positive correlation between the desire for nutritious and safe food and the extent of participation in UA. The result is consistent with earlier studies which reported that UA is a treasured supply of essential nutrients, protein, high-quality and healthy food at a low cost which would not otherwise be accessible (Smart et al., 2015; Poulsen et al., 2017). From Table 5, two main food-security-measurement variables (food-security scores and per capita food expenditure) were used to measure the food security status of the households. The chi-square values are significant for the two equations, indicating that the independent variables explain the dependent variables in the equations. The results from the Breusch– Pagan test for error independence show a chi-square test statistic of 7.338 with a p-value of less than 0.01, indicating that correlations (approximately 0.15) between the errors in the two equations are significant hence the Seemingly Unrelated Regression is a fit model. It should be pointed out that, apart from few factors that were not significant under both HFIAS scores and per capita foodexpenditure measurementoffood security, allotherfactors thatweresignificant under both measurements had the same direction of effect on food security. It presupposes that, the subjective food security measures such as HFIAS might not be less potent in assessing the food security status of a household compared to the objective food-security measures. From Table 5, three demographic characteristics influence household food security in Ghana. Specifically, an individual whose primary job is farming is more likely to be food insecure compared to an individual whose main job is not farming. Likewise, educational level positively influenced household food security. The relationship prompts that higher levels of education could positively influence production and nutrition decisions. Besides, higher education could create an opportunity for the household members to earn other off-farm incomes within the cities (Accra, Sunyani and Techiman) which could be used to supplement the household food purchases. The result corroborates earlier studies in urban households’ by Ayerakwa et al.
