 2010 Initiated application of geo-spatial techniques GIS and remote sensing in pest manage- ment. 2014 Detection of invasive South American tomato pinworm. 2015 Development of coupled InfoCrop-Pest model. 2015 Designing of light traps safer to beneficial insects. 2016 Implementation of ICT-based pest surveillance and advisory project CROPSAP & HORT- SAP in Maharashtra. 2017 Application of specialized pheromone & lure application technology (SPLAT) for mating disruption of cotton pink bollworm (PBW). 2018 Detection of invasive fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda. 2019 Invasion of desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria North West and Central India. 2019 Suppression of coconut rugose spiraling whitefly, Aleurodicus rugioperculatus through parasitoid, Encarsia guadeloupae. 2020 Invasion of cassava mealybug. 2020 Introduction of Pesticide Management Bill. 2021 Introduction of parasitoid Anagyrus lopezi for control of cassava mealy bug. During last one-decade sincere efforts made by ICAR-National Research Centre for Integrated Pest Management (NCIPM), New Delhi on validation and promotion of integrated pest management (IPM) have resulted in successful implementation of IPM in basmati rice in Gautam Budh Nagar (UP) in 1275 ha with participation of 715 farmers; Panipat, Jind and Kaithal in (Haryana) in 6904 ha involving 1748 farmers and Fatehgarh Sahib (Punjab) in 1270 ha with involvement of 117 farmers. The study indicated higher average yield and benefit-cost ratio (3.3-4.0) in IPM as compared to farmers’ practice with 58.3% enhancement in net return. Chemical pesticide application was reduced to 75.3 g a.i. ha-1 in IPM against 892.9 g a.i. ha-1 in farmers’ practice. 3.6. Alien invasive insect pests intercepted and classical biological control with international cooperation The spread of alien species is one of the greatest threats to the ecosystem in the country. Classical biological control appears to be an important approach in the management of these invasive species. International collaboration for the management of invasive species Indian Agriculture after Independence 220 is of utmost importance as exchange of resources can help in timely control of the pest. In the recent years several invasive insects are managed through Classical biological control by introduction of natural enemies from home range. The quarantine facility at NBAIR set up in the year 2009 as a fully equipped quarantine block as per the international standards, since then several natural enemies have been imported, such as Acerophagus papayae for the management of papaya mealybug, Quadrastichus mendeli for the management of eucalyptus gall wasp, recently the encyrtid wasp, Anagyrus lopezi was imported from Benin for the management of the cassava meal bug. 4. Nematology Nematodes are one amongst the various biotic factors that cause stress to plants. Approximately 40% of food crops are lost to agricultural pests, including plant nematodes (FAO 2019).
