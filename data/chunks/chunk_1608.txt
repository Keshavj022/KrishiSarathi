During the past 75 years, the Indian National Agricultural Research System (NARS) has been in the forefront, finding solutions for the problems of farming community as well as kept its competence in technology development through innovative research and development. Basic and strategic research and applied research in the frontier areas of agricultural sciences has accelerated the technology development. Realizing its importance, the Government of India established a national fund to support basic and strategic research with the objective of building capacity in basic and strategic research for solving agricultural problems of immediate, long-term and anticipatory nature. This would help in building partnership of required expertise available in various disciplines and institutions across the country to make India a global leader in research for development. The fund was named as ‘The National Fund for Basic, Strategic and Frontier Application Research in Agriculture’ (NFBSFARA).
