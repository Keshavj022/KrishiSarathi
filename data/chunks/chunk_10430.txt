 Farm mechanization The faster growth in mechanically powered equipment during past six decades significantly influenced crop productivity and established a direct correlation between farm power availability and food grain productivity. The mobile farm power sources (tractors, draught animals, power tillers, combine harvesters) as well as stationary power sources (diesel engines and electric pumps) have significantly contributed in growth of food-grains productivity in India. The percentage of agricultural workers to total workers in India declined from 59.1% in 1991 to 54.6% in 2011 and 39.4% in 2021. The draught animal population reduced from 78.42 million in 1971-72 to 38.74 million in 2018-19 resulting in reduction in the combined share of agricultural workers and draught animals in total farm power availability from 60.8% in 1971-72 to less than 10% in 2019-20. Total farm power availability from all sources during 1960 was 0.3 kW ha-1 and it increased to 2.54 kW ha-1 during 2019-20 (Fig. 2). Net sown area per tractor reduced from 487 ha/tractor in 1975-76 to 18 ha/tractor by 2019- 20 as population of working tractors rose to 7.5 million. In addition, power tillers, combine harvesters, diesel engines and electric motors increased to the extent of 0.50, 0.05, 11.50 and 7.50 million, respectively. The target of average farm power availability by 2030 is 4.0 kW ha-1 for timely and precise field operations. Indian Agriculture after Independence 286 Fig. 2. Power availability (kW ha-1) in agriculture over the years The current level of farm mechanization assessed for major cereals, pulses, oil-seeds, millets and cash crops indicate that the seedbed preparation is highly mechanized (more than 70%) and harvesting is the least mechanized at less than 32%. About 65% of wheat area is mechanically sown but planting/transplanting of sugarcane and rice are mechanized only up to 20 and 30%, respectively. Harvesting and threshing of wheat and rice is 60% mechanized. The harvesting of cotton/jute fibre and lac crop is yet to be mechanized. The overall mechanization level is 69% in wheat, 50% in rice, 45% in maize, 41% in pulses, 38% in oilseeds, 35% in cotton and 33% in millets and sugarcane. The overall farm mechanization level in the country is 47%, much lower than China (59.5%) and Brazil (75%). Numerous machinery/equipment for farm mechanization in independent India have been developed. The wheat thresher and combine harvester commercialized during 1960s played critical role in the success of the green revolution. The combine harvester also helped in timely harvesting of wheat during nation-wide lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. Some machinery developments like laser leveler, zero tillage equipment, happy seeder and inclined plate planter have become very popular in recent years. 3.
