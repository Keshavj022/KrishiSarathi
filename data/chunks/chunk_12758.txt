   Small indigenous fish: The small indigenous species (SIS) like mola (Amblypharyngodon mola), darkina (Esomus danricus), puti (Puntius spp.), kanla (Notopterus notopterus) etc which are considered as ‘fish of no importance to fisheries’ or ‘miscellaneous/ trash fishes’ in other states, are highly demanded in Tripura due to their unique taste and deliciousness. They price higher than many major carps due to high protein and micronutrient content. A kilogram of mola cost Rs. 300-400/-, darkina Rs. 200-300/- and puti Rs. 400-500/- in Tripura markets. Earlier, all these fishes had no importance in aquaculture and eradicated during pond preparation. But now they are highly sort-out for regional aquaculture. Their presence in pond can be manipulated and stimulated to optimize pond production rather eliminate them, which is a common practice in aquaculture. They have the potential for making value-added fish products like smoked fish, fermented fish, fish pickle etc. Being self-recruiting species (SRS), they can be maintained in the composite/polyculture system through regular thinning for additional food production and income generation. Marginal and 570 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 small farmers if miss stocking of ‘cash crops’ in any season due to hardship, they can still earn some money by maintaining these SIS in their ponds. The production of seasonal ponds can be multiplied by using these fishes. But their culture has not yet popularized in Tripura despite of number of trials and success. Composite culture of mola with Indian major carps (IMCs) was demonstrated in the Dhalai district of Tripura which showed mola was non-competing with IMCs when thinned at 2-3 months intervals with a total production of 2034kg fish/ha/7 months of which mola contributed 475 kg. Mola was an additional income for the farmers (Debnath et al. 2013). Santhosh et al. (2011) demonstrated 278 kg additional fish production/ha using this fish. Mr. Subul Chowdhury was identified as the most progressive farmer of South Tripura in respect of mola culture. He is producing 500 kg mola/ha/yr additionally beside IMCs (4500 kg/ha) which gives him an extra income of Rs. 75000/yr. In his opinion, mola is giving additional income to him without any investment or serious management (Santhosh et al., 2011). Composite culture of Puntius sophore with IMCs was demonstrated that the fish was non-competing with IMCs when thinned at 2-3 months interval and it was an additional income for the farmers. Total production was 2115.23 kg/ha/7 months (Debnath et al., 2014).   Substitute source of lime: The soil of Tripura is acidic therefore, it demands higher dose of lime (500-1000 kg/ha) during fish culture. But lime is not available in Tripura, it is mostly imported from main lands and become a costly affair in aquaculture. As an alternative, the ash of banana, mustard, paddy straw, fly ash from kilns etc can be used to minimize the cost of liming.
