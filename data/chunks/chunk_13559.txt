 So if they assessed 50 animals in a week, nearly 12 or 13 were administered antibiotics. The record for the treatment of the livestock was maintained. The prescription slips were given to livestock owners only during veterinary hospital visits. For home visits, the veterinary doctor or assistant carried a medicine kit and recorded the administered medicine in the hospital’s register. It was reported that the medicine supply was inadequate eliminating the scope of medicine ex­ piry. Biomedical waste management was sought as per government guidelines. The most common illnesses for which antibiotics were pre­ scribed included fever, mastitis, diarrhoea, post-partum complications, and infected wounds. Antibiotics administration was based on clinical signs and symptoms. Apart from antibiotics, essential medicinal for­ mulations like multivitamins, glucose strips, and calcium were also administered. 4. Discussion The use of antibiotics in food animals has a significant impact on human health, as antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be transmitted be­ tween humans and animals through various pathways including contact, in food products, and from the environment [16]. A study conducted in rural settings of Peru underscores the interconnectedness of animal, human and environmental transmission of AMR In the One health framework [17]. Studies have highlighted the high prevalence of mastitis in dairy cattle in India [18,19] and antibiotics are mostly used in the management of mastitis cases [20]. Findings from our study confirmed that one of the most common illnesses for which antibiotics were prescribed was mastitis. This aligns with other studies in India highlighting the substantial burden of mastitis in dairy cattle and the widespread use of antibiotics for its management [21–23]. Findings from the veterinary doctor revealed that around 25 % of the livestock were given antibiotics for treatment during home visits. Out of the total livestock catered to during home visits, 25 % were administered anti­ biotics, as mentioned by the veterinarian. Out of the total livestock catered to during home visits, 25 % were administered antibiotics, as mentioned by the veterinarian. In veterinary medicine, considerable debate concerns the use of antibiotics in animals reared for human consumption [16]. One of the key concerns related to antibiotic use in food animals is the potential presence of antibiotic residues in animal Table 5 Pattern of consumption of dairy and non-dairy products in last 7 days- one month.
