 Linseed also possesses high-quality fibre having remarkable properties, including high strength and absorbency, making it ideal for various applications. In the textile industry, linseed fibre is used to produce linen fabrics known for their durability, breathability, and luxurious feel. The plant also improves soil fertility, reduces soil erosion, and requires fewer pesticides and fertilizers compared to other crops. Moreover, the use of linseed plant as a whole to produce innovative industrial products would enhance the sustainability of natural resources.

Belonging to the Linaceae family, this annual plant has been cultivated for its seeds, which are commonly referred to as flaxseeds. It is mainly grown in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Jharkhand, and Bihar. The current status of linseed production is 3.34 million metric tonnes. India ranks 3rd and shares about 9% of world’s linseed production. India is expected to produce around 140 metric thousand of linseed. Linseed is renowned for its multiple applications in various industries, including food, medicine, and textiles. Linseed oil, also called flaxseed oil, is rich in omega 3 fatty acid, lignans and other beneficial compounds, making it a valuable dietary supplement and ingredient in various health products. Linseed fibre, derived from the stems of the flax plant, holds significant importance as a versatile natural resource. This fibrous material, extracted from the plant’s stalks, offers numerous benefits across various industries, including textiles, construction, and even healthcare. Plant structure Linseed is an annual herbaceous plant that typically grows upright, reaching heights of around 1–1.5 m (3–5 feet). The stem is slender, erect, and branching with a smooth texture. Leaves The leaves of the linseed plant are simple, narrow and alternate. They are lanceolate in shape, measuring about 2–4 cm (0.8–1.6 inches) in width and 2–6 cm (0.8–2.4 inches) in length. The leaves are sessile or have very short petioles and have a prominent midrib running along their length. Flowers Linseed produces attractive, delicate flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The flowers are typically pale blue, although cultivars with white or pink flowers also exist. The flowers are symmetrical, with five petals arranged in a cup-shaped structure. Each flower has a diameter of approximately 2 cm (0.8 inches). The plant is also known for its transient blossoms, with individual flowers lasting only a day. Fruit and seeds After pollination, the flowers give rise to a fruit called a capsule or boll. The capsule is round and measures about 6–8 mm (0.2–0.3 inches) in diameter. Within the capsule are small, flat, oval-shaped seeds, which are the linseeds or flaxseeds.
