 The Rhus semialata was further investigated for bioactive compounds present in stem bark extract and three compounds were isolated and identified. The Compound 1 and 2 were identified as gallic acid and methyl gallate. Another isolated compound was observed to be having close resemblance with gallotannin. These compounds were tested for their anti-cancer activity against U937 breast cancer cell line using MTT assay. Compound 1 (gallic acid) significantly reduced the cell viability in a dose-dependent manner.
