 HJ-513 Time of Sowing: The optimum period of sowing is mid-June to mid- July. Seed Rate: 30-35 kg per hectare Method of Sowing: Line sowing, maintaining row to row spacing of 25 cm should be preferred to broadcasting. Fertilizer Application: In the rainfed or low rainfall areas, drill 50 kg of N per hectare in rows at sowing. In irrigated areas, apply 50 kg of N and 20 kg P2O5 per hectare at the time of sowing and another 50 kg N per hectare about one month later. Arhar Improved Varieties: Manak (H77-216), Paras (H82-A) Time of sowing- Under irrigated conditions, sowing of crop should be done in the month of June and under rainfed conditions sowing should be done at the onset of monsoon. Seed rate: 12.5 to 15 kg seed is required for sowing in one hectare. Method of sowing: Sowing should be done at row to row spacing of 40 cm and plant to plant spacing of 15 cm. Seed treatment: Inoculation of Arhar seed with Rhizobium and PSB biofertlizers are essential for getting better yield of the crop. 60 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS Fertilizer use: Application of 20 kg N: 40 kg P2O5 per hectare at time of sowing is required for harvesting good crop yield. Groundnut Improved Varieties: MH-4, HNG-69, GJG-19. Time of sowing: Optimum time of sowing of groundnut is entire month of June. Under irrigated conditions, sowing of seeds should be completed by second fortnight of June, whereas under rainfed conditions sowing at the onset of monsoon should be done. Sowing of crop after 15 July should be avoided. Seed rate: The seed rate depends on the size of kernels of the varieties. However, for medium size kernels varieties, seed rate of 80 kg per hectare is required. Method of sowing: Sowing should be done preferably in rows at a spacing of 30 cm and maintaining plant to plant spacing of 15 cm. Seed treatment: Treatment of seed with Thiram or Captan or Emisan 3 g/kg seed is essential for management of seed and soil borne diseases. For management of termites and white grub treat the seed with 15 ml Chloropyriphos 20 EC/kg seed. Fertilizer use: Application of 15 kg N, 50 kg P2O5, 25 kg K2O and 25 kg Zinc sulphate per hectare is required for obtaining good crop yield. It will be desirable to apply doses of all the nutrients before sowing. Use of gypsum as sulphur source has been found beneficial in groundnut crop. Rice Improved Varieties: a) Medium duration: HKR-127, HKR-126, HKR-120, HSD-1, Jaya, PR-106. b) Mid to early duration: HKR-47, IR-64, Pusa-1509, Pusa-1121. c) Early duration: HKR-48, Govind. 61 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS Time of nursery sowing: a) For early duration varieties: 15 May to 31 June. b) Medium, mid-early and hybrid rice: 15 May to 31 May. Seed selection: Select bold and disease-free seed for better results. Treatment of seed with 10 % salt solution should be done to get bold seeds. Seed treatment: Soaking of 1 ha seed (20-30 kg seed) in 25 litre water solution with 25 g bavistin and 2.5 g streptocycline is done for 24 hrs.
