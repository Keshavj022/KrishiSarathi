 After applying our masks, we had estimates of monthly ABA, which we combined within each season to develop seasonal ABA products. The timing of seasons varied across regions in India based on several factors, including crop planted, climate, and water availability (Devi et al., 2017). To account for these differences, we created a state-wise crop calendar based on state cultivation calendars, GoI-prescribed sowing dates, and a survey of the literature (Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, 2021; Sahu et al., 2021) and used this to create regionally- appropriate ABA seasonal data. Table S2 provides the details of sea­ sonal separation for CRB used in this study. The final products are extracted at the district level from 2011 to 2020. We named the burning M.V. Deshpande et al.

Validation for ABA extraction methodology We validated our ABA extraction methodology using high-resolution (3 m) estimates of BA derived using PlanetScope imagery for Madhya Pradesh (Deshpande et al., 2022b) and for Punjab (Krishna and Mkon­ diwa, 2023). For the present study, we selected 40 sample polygons that were greater than 55 ha in size, representing burned and unburned fields in Punjab and Madhya Pradesh. We then used these data to train and validate a random forest classifier in GEE. Burn scars within 500 m of forested areas were excluded from sampling to avoid the impact of forest fires on our training and validation data. We performed hyperparameter tuning to select and limit the optimal number of decision trees to 150, and a ratio of 70:10:20 was set for training, hyperparameter tuning and validation of the classifier. 3.4. Emissions estimation We estimated district-wise CO, CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from crop residue burning over India for the Kharif, Rabi, Summer, Autumn and Winter seasons 2011–2020 using IPCC (2006) inventory prepara­ tion guidelines and global fire emissions estimates during 1997–2016 (IPCC, 2006; Jain et al., 2014; Sahai et al., 2011; Van Der Werf et al., 2017). We also estimated CO2e from CO2, CH4 and N2O and their global warming potentials (IPCC, 2022). Carbon content (CC) is estimated from CO, CO2 and CH4, assuming these gaseous pollutants represent the bulk of carbon emissions during burning (Akagi et al., 2011).
