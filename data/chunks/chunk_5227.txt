The herb jhau contains 14.6% protein, 7.1% ash, 23.8% crude fibre and 42% carbohydrates besides 17% vitamin C. Similarly, another herb bhabri also contains higher levels of protein (15.4%), ash (14%), crude fibre (10.6%), carbohydrates (43.9%) a nd vitamin Official Analytical Chemists, Inc.

This might be responsible for the selective preference of the food item by the people and added properties related to medicinal values of food item containing these herbs. Analysis of the mixed bhaley sample just before cooking was done to determine the effect of cooking on the nutritive status of the final food item, and the values are reported in Table 3.
