) vi Recommendation:   Yield and water productivity can be enhanced by adopting better soil moisture conservation practices and better management, as well as by increasing provision of other factor inputs (NPK fertilizer, weed and pest control).   The large area of salt-affected soils that are still lying barren should be targeted for more specific efforts for reclamation of soils or best land use contributing towards mitigating the impact of climate change. NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (NRM) Compendium Salient Recommendations 44 NRM 16 i Name of the Applicant Anand Agricultural University, Anand ii Title International Conference on Food, Water and Energy Nexus in Arena of Climate Change iii Venue and Date(s) 14-16 October 2016 at Anand Agricultural University, Anand iv Amount of grant by ICAR Rs. 3.00 Lakhs v ICAR's Sanction no. F.No.24(13)/2016 Cdn. (Tech) vi Recommendation:   More use of solar energy source for water pumping and mechanical farming activities at village level needs to be promoted.   Adequate monitoring system should be put in place for long term sustainability of back water tourism.   SRI method in rice farming should be followed for water saving with application of press mud of poultry manure enriched with effective microorganisms for better growth and stress tolerance compared to chemical fertilizers.   Urgent need to address the remedial efforts for salinity increase in coastal area due to over pumping of ground water showing high sodium and magnesium levels in water.
