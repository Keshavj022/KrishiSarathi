Columns (1)‚Äì(2) are restricted to program-eligible villages (N=37, N(treatment)=15), and Columns (4)‚Äì(5) are restricted to program-ineligible villages with a neighboring eligible village (N=47, N(treatment)=14). Columns (3) and (6) display ùëù-values from a comparison of means across treatment and control villages, obtained from a simple univariate regression with state fixed effects, where standard errors are clustered at the village level. Outcomes are measured in the 1999 REDS village survey. In my matched sample, there are 6 program-eligible treated villages and 9 program-eligible control villages close to towns, 9 program- eligible treated villages and 13 program-eligible control villages far from towns, 8 incidental treated villages and 15 incidental control vil- lages close to towns, and 6 incidental treated villages and 18 incidental control villages far from towns. 6. Results 6.1. Validating the parallel trends assumption The difference-in-differences specification relies on the assumption that in the absence of PMGSY, the evolution of outcomes in villages that receive roads in earlier years would have parallel trends with that of villages that receive roads in later years. I validate this assumption with three separate exercises ‚Äî I examine trends in outcomes in the pre- period using data from the Indian Population Census as well as REDS survey waves, and I employ an event study approach using remote sensing data on night time luminosity. First, I use three rounds of the decennial census (1991, 2001 and 2011) to examine trends in two village-level outcomes ‚Äî total popula- tion and total number of agricultural workers. Given that PMGSY was launched in December 2000 and road construction only commenced in 2001, I treat 1991 and 2001 as pre-PMGSY years. I classify all villages that received PMGSY roads between 2001‚Äì2010 as treated. Panel A of Fig. 3 plots yearly means by treatment status for program-eligible villages (a) and incidental villages (b). There are two features worth highlighting. First, treatment villages are larger than control villages in (a); this is consistent with program rules that dictated larger eligible villages were to receive program roads before smaller eligible villages. Second, there appears to be an uptick in the number of agricultural workers in treated villages in 2011, consistent with an increase in agricultural activity. I conduct a formal test of equality of trends in the pre-period ‚Äî in particular, I estimate differential changes in outcomes across treatment and control villages prior to the launch of PMGSY using data from 1991 and 2001.
