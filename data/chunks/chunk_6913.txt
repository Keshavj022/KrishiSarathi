 Major thematic areas were varietal evaluation; integrated nutrient management; integrated pest management; integrated disease management; integrated crop management; weed management; resource conservation technologies; farm machineries; cropping systems; post-harvest technology/value-addition and small scale income generation enterprises. Technologies were also assessed in other thematic areas such as seed production; soil health management; integrated farming system; drudgery reduction; storage techniques; mushroom cultivation; information and communication technology; integrated pest and disease management; fodder and nursery raising; water management; biological control and protected cultivation. Varietal evaluation was the major theme of technology assessment with 1,855 technologies assessed through 7,350 trials at 3,491 locations. This thematic area was assessed by almost all the KVK in the country (644 KVKs). Integrated nutrient management (953 technologies, 5,079 trials and 2,043 locations by 507 KVKs) and integrated pest management (833 technologies, 4,455 trials and 1,746 locations, by 438 KVKs) were the other major thematic areas on which technology assessment was carried out. Livestock: The KVKs assessed 1,097 technological options pertaining to different thematic areas of livestock production and management at 2,516 locations through 6,210 trials. The thematic areas assessed are nutrition management; animal disease management; livestock production management; feed and fodder management; evaluation of breeds; fish production; processing and value-addition; small scale income generation and composite fish culture. Nutrition management was the major thematic area with 284 technologies assessed through 1,788 trials at 473 locations. Technologies related to management of cows, buffalo, sheep, goat, poultry, pig and fish were assessed for confirming the location suitability of various technological interventions. Farm and non-farm enterprises: KVKs could test 471 technologies under farm and non-farm enterprises at 1,040 locations through 6,124 trials. Technologies belonged to major thematic areas such as processing and value-addition; mechanization; resource conservation technology; organic farming; entrepreneurship development; mushroom cultivation; drudgery reduction; small-scale income generation; storage techniques; health and nutrition and post- harvest management. Processing and value-addition (85 technologies assessed at 154 locations through 247 trials), mechanization (35 technologies assessed at 26 locations through 190 trials) and resource conservation technologies (33 technologies, 184 trials at 19 locations) were the dominant thematic areas chosen by the KVKs for assessment. Women empowerment: As part of technology assessment, 371 technologies pertaining to farm women were assessed through 3,222 trials at 756 locations.
