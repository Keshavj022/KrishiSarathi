, 2006), recent archaeobotanical research and targeted radiocarbon dating have shown that rice was likely introduced fully domesticated from the Middle Ganga region (Kingwell-Banham et al., 2018) alongside a package of other domesticated crops and animals. Preliminary data also suggests that the region saw the independent domestication of pi­ geon pea, and early arboriculture in the form of carbonised fruit peel and nut shell fragments (Kingwell-Banham et al., 2018). In contrast to East India, the Deccan Plateau, especially the southern part, has been very well studied and over two hundred Southern Neolithic sites have been systematically excavated to date (King­ well-Banham et al., 2015). Roughly fifty per cent of the sites in the southern region are ashmounds (anthropogenic mounds made of burnt cattle dung and cultural material) (e.g., Allchin 1963; Allchin et al., 1982; Fuller 2006a, 2006b; Fuller et al., 2007; Boivin et al., 2018). The Southern Neolithic tradition starts in the 3rd millennium BC as small agropastoral communities likely with introduced domesticates from the North. By the middle of the 3rd millennium BC, the first ashmounds begin to appear in the archaeological record, but clear evidence for the Southern Neolithic crop package (including plants like wheat, barley, millets, and pulses which indicate year-round multi-season cultivation) is present only from c. 2000 BC (Fuller 2006a, 2006b; Boivin et al., 2018). Moreover, the southern part of the Deccan (southern Karnataka and south-west Andhra Pradesh) is believed to have been a site of in­ dependent agricultural origins, i.e. domestication of millets, Brachiaria ramosa and Setaria verticillata, and pulses, Macrotyloma uniflorum and Vigna radiata in the Neolithic (e.g., Korisettar et al., 2001a, 2001b; Fuller 2006a, 2006b; Fuller et al., 2007; Fuller 2011; Fuller and Murphy 2014; Kingwell-Banham et al., 2015; Murphy and Fuller 2017; Boivin et al., 2018). By c. 800 BC rice cultivation is adopted into this established multi-seasonal agricultural practice (Fuller et al., 2007; Boivin et al., 2018). Owing to its intensive demands for water/irrigation and associ­ ated labour necessities, rice agriculture is hypothesised is to have spread in South Asia, first through ecologically conducive wet zones, and to drier areas only when social complexity and labour control could be manifested (Fuller and Qin 2009). While textual records and archaeo­ logical evidence of irrigation features have been seen as evidence of irrigated rice agriculture in the region, recent phytolith and charred macrobotanical data indicate that this link needs to be evaluated with additional lines of evidence (Kingwell-Banham, 2019). The two regions mentioned in this study not only differ in geography and climate, but also in terms of the trajectories towards early agricul­ ture. We hypothesise, therefore, that these differences should be discernible isotopically.
