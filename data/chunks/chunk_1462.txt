 However, this vital agricultural system faces numerous challenges, exacerbated by climate change and other factors. Rainfed agriculture in India occupies 51% of the net sown area (70.77 m ha). Majority of land holdings out of 46 million is under unirrigated (40%) and partly irrigated (13%). Among the several field crops, 39% of rice, 83% of nutri-cereals (other than rice and wheat), 81% of pulses, 72% of oilseeds and 66% of cotton is rainfed. More importantly, 2/3rd of livestock is dependent on drylands. This article explores the key challenges confronting rainfed agriculture and the promising opportunities that exist for its sustainable development. By understanding these issues, we can work towards building more resilient and productive rainfed agricultural systems that can meet the growing demands for food and livelihoods. Challenges in rainfed agriculture Rainfed agriculture in India supports the livelihoods of millions of small and marginal farmers. However, this system is highly vulnerable to a range of environmental, infrastructural, and socio-economic challenges. Climate Indian Farming 75 (01): 05-08; January 2025 variability, particularly in the form of irregular monsoons, droughts, and extreme weather events, has increasingly jeopardized rainfed agriculture in India. Crop related issues Crop production in dry farming regions faces numerous challenges, largely due to reliance on rainfed conditions and limited resources of smallholder farmers. Variable rainfall is a key issue, with inconsistent patterns leading to frequent crop failures. Rain often falls intensely over a few days, causing runoff and soil erosion. The distribution of rainfall during the growing season is crucial, as uneven rain leads to water shortages at critical crop stages. Monsoon irregularities further complicate farming, with delayed onset or early withdrawal reducing yields and prolonged dry spells causing drought stress. High temperature, low humidity, and hot winds increase moisture loss and contribute to soil erosion, creating unstable and low- productivity conditions for farmers in these regions. Drought It is one of the most severe challenges, especially in states like Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka, and parts of Madhya Pradesh, where drought frequency is on the rise. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), these droughts are expected to Indian Farming 6 January 2025 intensify further due to global climate change. India has already witnessed shifts in monsoon patterns, leading to delayed rains, long dry spells, and shorter, intense bursts of rainfall that fail to provide consistent water for crops. This uncertainty in monsoon timing and intensity has had a direct impact on rainfed agriculture, with farmers struggling to adapt. Extreme weather events, such as cyclones in coastal regions like Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, and flooding in parts of Bihar and Assam, have also increased.
