 l Performance of local goat was found better in terms of kidding percentage, birth weight and reproductive problems like still birth under stall feeding than grazing. l In local goat, the total ingestion time under stall feeding was 55.33 minutes, whereas under grazing it was 55.91 minutes. l Maximum seed yield was obtained in common sesban with the application of phosphorus. NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 91 SUCCESS STORY COMPLETE FEED BLOCK FOR CATTLE FEEDING The wheat bhusa (40%) was mixed with berseem hay (20%), molasses (20%), concentrate mix (19%) which includes linseed cake and ground barley in a ratio of 1 : 1 and mineral and vitamins (1%) to produce a complete feed block (CFB). The linseed cake was soaked overnight in water. Molasses were heated in an open pan up to a temperature of 70°C to liquidize it and then mixed with remaining ingredients to have proper mixing. These ingredients were thoroughly mixed manually. The added moisture was adjusted at 20% to have proper binding of the material. The mixture was then processed at the IGFARI, Jhansi, in densifying machine hopper to get desired blocks. The complete feed blocks of size 31 × 31 × 50 cm were made weighing 20 kg each, which can be easily handled by a single person. The machine had an output capacity of about 500 kg/hour with an average density of prepared bales as 400.0 kg/m3. A total of 5 labourers are required for the complete operation. The prepared blocks have 88.31% organic matter, 9.72% crude protein, 44.02% NDF, 31.11% ADF, 12.91% HC, 3.27% lignin and 11.69% ash. On-farm feeding trial of prepared CFB were conducted in nearby villages of Jhansi to assess the acceptability of the product. Two groups of buffaloes were made, 1 group was fed with CFB and the second with traditional material (wheat bhusa ad lib and 2 kg concentrate) as usual. In addition, 5 kg green berseem was also fed to each animal. After 1 month feeding of CFB as adoption period, 7 days digestibility trial was also conducted. Feeding trials indicated that average dry-matter (DM) intake/animal and average and dry-matter intake/100 kg body weight was similar in the group fed with CFB and the traditional feeding system. The dry-matter digestibility and average milk yields were, however, 9.15% and 19% higher in the group fed with CFB. Average milk fat content (8.3%) was similar in both the groups. Reduction of Volatalization Loss of NH3 through Combined Use of Inorganic and Organic Manuring Combined use of urea and FYM in 1 : 1 ratio produced maximum biomass yield (35.4 tonnes/ha green and 8.67 tonnes/ha dry) of sorghum + cowpea. However, it was at par with 100% FYM, 25% urea + 75% FYM and 25% urea + 50% FYM + biofertilizers. The volatilization losses of ammonia could be reduced significantly by combined use of 25% urea – N + 50% FYM-N + biofertilizers. The level of organic carbon, available N and K and microbial biomass carbon improved maximum in case of 100% manuring (FYM).
