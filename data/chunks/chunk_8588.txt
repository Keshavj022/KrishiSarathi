 The genetic response in 40-week egg production ranged from 0.99 to 1.52 eggs/generation. The regression coefficients for various important economical traits in the control population were nonsignificant indicating its stability in eliminating the environmental trend. Evaluation of strain/breed crosses for egg production: Among 2-way, strain and breed crosses JG strain cross produced the highest number of eggs followed by JR, HR, HI, RH and CD in order of merit. The JG strain cross pullets also matured with the lowest age at sexual maturity of 129.41 days. Comparative performance of Rhode Island Red pure strains: The RIR selected line revealed superior economic traits compared to the control population. Average genetic response per generation for egg number and egg mass up to 40th week of age and 40th week egg weight were highly significant and positive. The corresponding estimates for the above traits on genetic scale were 1.21 eggs, 76.77 g and 0.12 g, respectively. The poultry for egg component of the AICRP on Poultry Improvement, has egg- strains, IWD and IWF at ANGRAU, Hyderabad; IWN and IWP at KAU, Mannuthy and GAU, Anand, besides IWG, IWH, IWI and IWJ at the CARI, Izatnagar. The response of selection for enhanced period of 64 weeks showed an increase in egg number by 10 to 12 eggs in IWD and IWF strains over controls at the ANGRAU centre. The realized genetic gain in egg production was 1.25, 0.99 1.52 and 1.18 eggs up to 40 weeks of age per generation in IWH, IWI, IWG and IWJ, respectively. This gain was statistically significant. The egg weight at 28 and 40 weeks of age was, respectively, 50.47 g and 54.04 g for IWN, and 50.2 and 54.1 g for IWP. On selection of the same strains for feed efficiency at the GAU, the average feed consumption/day was 109 g and 106 g for IWN and IWP, respectively, up to 40 weeks of age. A significant decline in feed requirement of 500 g in IWN and 400 g in IWP lines to produce 1 kg egg mass was noticed in this generation. A strain cross developed at the CARI, Izatnagar, produced 301.8 eggs, which was higher than three prominent commercials, in 31st RSPPT, Bangalore. The feed intake (117 g/day), feed efficiency (1.77 kg/dozen eggs) and margin of receipts (Rs 58.29) over feed cost were markedly better over commercials. Another cross from the KAU recorded 282 eggs in the same test with a margin receipt of Rs 40.14 over feed cost. Selection for efficiency of feed utilization in egg type chicken: IWK was evaluated for feed efficiency. The pullets of selected line matured 9 days earlier compared to Parents of White Leghorn cross IMPROVEMENT OF LAYER POPULATIONS At the PDP, Hyderabad, pure lines IWH and IWI are being maintained under this programme. In S3 generation the selected lines matured 4–14 days earlier, and produced 15–21 eggs more than the control. The body weight declined by 110– 140 g at 40 weeks of age in these lines. The egg weights were 44.69 g and 45.26 g; 49.38 g and 49.
