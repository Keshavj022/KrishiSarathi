 Model could also ensure household level demand of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, milk, vegetables, and fruits compared to the existing system. Food and nutritional security of Agri-horti based IFS Model (0.70 ha) The model could provide all the essential commodities to a farm family in terms of fruits, vegetables, milk, oilseeds, pulses and cereals. The Agri-horti model resulted in the production of cereals (1193 kg), Pulse (413 kg), Oilseeds (21.35 kg), Milk (2328 kg), Vegetables (4205 kg) and Fruits (2230 kg) and had been able to meet the demand of family for food and nutrition. The rest excess produce upon selling provided the farm family with the cash to meet their social demands. Resource recycling and material flow through integration of Banana Module with other components of the farming system The integration of banana variety Monthan (Culinary purpose) in this model has provided the farmers with Food production in 0.70 ha IFS model Table 1.

The variety Monthan planted at a spacing of 2×2 m in the month of July starts bearing fruits in 13-14 months. Among the full grown plantation, intercropping with vegetables like pea and soybean has been done successfully. The interaction of different by-products has been studied and different by products have been utilized as input for others. The by- products of banana include suckers, leaves, pseudostem, fruits and banana flowers. The fruits and the flowers are utilized for home consumption or are sold in the market. The pseudostem and leaves are utilized for preparation of compost or vermicomposting. The chopped tender leaves and pseudostem are fed as fodder to animals as depicted below.
