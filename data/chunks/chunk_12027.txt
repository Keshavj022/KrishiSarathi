 Gandhian philosophy emphasizes upon upliftment of common man though enabling him to access the basic amenities such as food, cloth, shelter, health and education by earning locally with a dignity of life and livelihood. The poverty, superstition, exploitation in the caste system, concentration of power, violence, communality etc. have been the major negative factors in rural development. He always emphasized agriculture and allied activities to be the backbone of rural economy, which should be performed with least external inputs. The Khadi industry, cottage industry, rural crafts industry can be pivotal in reviving rural economy and self-dependent rural India in future. His sublime vision is all round development of rural India based on his ideas, principles, values and harmony with nature.
