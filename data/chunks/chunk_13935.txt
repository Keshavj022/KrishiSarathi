 The main questions were, • How can agriculture credit policies be designed to enhance accessi­ bility and inclusivity while promoting sustainable development in the Indian agricultural sector? • What roles do digital technologies and platforms play in improving credit access for farmers while promoting environmental sustainability? • What policy interventions are needed to align agriculture credit frameworks with sustainable development goals, and how can stakeholders collaborate to implement these solutions effectively? 2.2. Data collection The purposive sampling and snowball technique was used in this study as it contributes to the credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability of the study, thus addressing the aspects of rigor and trustworthiness. Purposive sampling helps in uncovering multiple re­ alities and diverse perspectives, which is essential for qualitative research aiming to explore various dimensions of human experiences and behavior (Wan, 2019). The latter increase the diversity of the sample, which can lead to more comprehensive and varied data (Kirchherr & Charles, 2018). Both allows for selecting participants based on the study's purpose, ensuring that each participant provides unique and rich information of value to the study, thereby enhancing the val­ idity and reliability of the research. Dakshina Kannada district was selected for this study due to its unique agricultural landscape and the challenges farmers face in accessing credit. The district is home to 116 Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperatives (PACS), which play a crucial role in providing financial services to farmers. Despite the presence of these cooperatives, many farmers in Dakshina Kannada continue to encounter difficulties in obtaining timely and adequate credit. A study by (Lokesha & Hawaldar, 2019) states that demographic, agricultural, and credit-related factors influence the utilization of agricultural credit in Dakshina Kannada district. Furthermore, the district's diverse agricultural practices, including the cultivation of various cash crops, necessitate tailored J. Hiranya and H.G.

However, the existing credit infra­ structure often falls short in meeting these specific needs, leading to suboptimal utilization of available credit facilities. By focusing on Dakshina Kannada, this study aims to identify the specific barriers to credit access faced by farmers and to develop targeted interventions that can enhance financial inclusion and support sustainable agricultural development in the region. A total of 72 participants were selected, with each cluster comprising 9 to 12 individuals, including bankers, farmers, and other stakeholders. When selecting participants (P), it was ensured that participants had prior experience with the agricultural loan approval process in some capacity.
