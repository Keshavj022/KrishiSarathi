 Experiments revealed that drip irrigation can save up to 45% irrigation water besides enhancing water-use efficiency, higher net returns under maize based intensive cropping systems. Weed control: Uniform spray of 500-600 g/acre Atrataf/ Atragold/ Masstaf/ Atari (atrazine) within 10 days after sowing in 200 l/acre water followed by one hoeing at 30 days after sowing gives effective control of weeds. Alternatively, spray 115 ml per acre Laudis 420 SC (tembotrione) in 150 litres of water at 20 days after sowing provides effective control of mixed weed flora. SUMMARY Green revolution shifted the area of rice-wheat cropping system in Punjab and Haryana from 37% and 20% in 1966 to nearly 84% and 61% in 2018, respectively resulting in over exploitation of ground water, increased energy demand, deletion of soil fertility and burning of rice residues. Based on the demand and economic returns, maize-based cropping systems can replace the rice and wheat crops by improving the soil fertility with additional income. Adoption of resource conservation techniques in maize- based cropping systems can further enhance the water productivity and net income of the farmers. *Corresponding author email: todarmal.poonia6@gmail.com TEXTBOOK OF WATERSHED HYDROLOGY TECHNICAL ASPECTS Pages: v + 478; Price: ` 1000.00, US$ 90.00; Postage: `50 ISBN No.: 978-81-7164-203-8 For obtaining copies, please contact: Business Unit ICAR-Directorate of Knowledge Management in Agriculture Krishi Anusandhan Bhawan – I, Pusa, New Delhi 110012 Tel: 011-25843657; email: bmicar@icar.org.in, businessuniticar@gmail.com website: www.icar.gov.in “Textbook of Watershed Hydrology” is an attempt to fill the gap of quality textbooks in one of the major subjects namely the watershed hydrology. It is believed that the principles and practices of watershed hydrology will resolve the national land and water degradation problems. The textbook is divided into 13 Chapters. Beginning with general introduction to hydrology, it covers the chapter-wise global and Indian water balance, precipitation measurement and analysis procedures.

There are various constraints regarding the wheat production and productivity starting from soil characteristics to crop harvesting. The climate and weather conditions are adverse for wheat cultivation in north- eastern part of India. Topography of northeast India is somewhat undulating, covered with dense forest, flood plains and hills. Other problem is indigenous farming system in northeast India. Pest and disease problems may also arise due to high humid climatic conditions.
