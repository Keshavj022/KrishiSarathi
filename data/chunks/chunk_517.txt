These models provide valuable insights into how different crops will respond to changing climatic conditions, helping farmers and policymakers make informed decisions regarding crop selection and management practices. Capacity building and education: The capacity of farmers, researchers and other stakeholders is essential for effective adaptation to climate change. By providing training, education, and resources, individuals can acquire the knowledge and skills needed to implement sustainable agricultural practices and respond to climate challenges. Prioritizing vegetable resistance: Given the specific vulnerability of vegetables to climate change, efforts are focused on developing resistant varieties. The negative impacts of changing environmental conditions on vegetable crops can be minimized by breeding or engineering vegetables with increased tolerance to climate stresses. Global collaboration and integration of efforts: Addressing the challenges of climate change requires a collective and collaborative approach. Instead of individual institutions working in isolation, a holistic strategy that integrates global efforts is necessary. Countries and organizations can pool their efforts to develop effective solutions for adapting to climate change and ensuring food security by sharing knowledge, resources, and expertise. SUMMARY Vegetables are a cornerstone of a healthy human diet, offering a multitude of essential nutrients and bioactive compounds that contribute to overall well-being and disease prevention. Their nutrient density, combined with their diverse array of bioactive compounds, makes vegetables an indispensable part of a balanced and nutritious diet, promoting optimal health and well- being throughout life. The bioactive compounds in vegetables, such as antioxidants, polyphenols, and carotenoids, help protect cells from damage, reduce inflammation and lower the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers. The production of vegetable crops faces considerable difficulties due to climate change.
