India has pledged to reduce its emissions by 45% from 2005 levels, increase the share of renewable energy to 50% of its total energy consumption by 20301, and become carbon neutral by 2070. To fulﬁl these targets, India has been aggressively pursuing sustainable alternatives in the energy sector to convert its pre- dominantly fossil fuel-based energy2 to renewables, such as solar, wind and hydro (IEA, 2022). As of March 2023, the country managed solar power of 66.8 GW already installed, and another 36.3 GW on the cards; wind power of 42.6 GW installed and 10.8 GW planned for and hydropower of 46.8 GW capacity and 0.2 *Corresponding author: +91 9742221313.

In the transport sector, Government of India (GOI) has created a policy framework with lucrative incentives to convert its automobiles, especially the two and three-wheeler segments, into electric ﬂeets (Singh et al., 2022). Incentives have been put in place for both consumers as well as producers to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). The government has also been encouraging auto- makers to produce ﬂex-fuel vehicles to reduce the country’s dependence on fossil fuels. If successful, these measures will not only reduce the carbon footprint but also reduce the coun- try’s dependence on imported oil (Balat & Balat, 2009). While the roadmap for the energy and transport sectors is easy to map out, it is not so straightforward in the agricul- ture sector, which is the third largest contributor of green- house gas (GHG) emissions.
