 In the arena of human resource development, ICAR is the nodal agency for admission of foreign students to Indian Institutions for agricultural education. To this effect, DARE/ICAR administers (i) India-Africa fellowship, (ii) India- Afghanistan fellowship, (iii) India- Nepal fellowship, (iv) SAARC PhD Scholarship in Agricultural Biotechnology and (v) Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International fellowship for doctoral research. In addition to these, DARE/ICAR has entered into several collaborations through countryâ€™s bilateral arrangements to benefit from knowledge sharing and overall experience and exposure to the latest development of technology from/for various countries. In short, the DARE-ICAR while involved in promoting agricultural research, education and extension at national level, it is also having its footprints beyond borders. Some of the salient and prospective collaborations at international level through bilateral/multilateral agreements and also through MoUs/Work Plans have been summarized in this document. xi xii xiii xiv The Indian National Agricultural Research and Education Systems (NARES) is one of the largest in the world with respect to human resource, infrastructure, research, education and extension network.
