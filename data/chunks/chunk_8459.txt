 During this year some special initiatives have been taken for the spread of technology in the North- East region by experimenting with participatory approaches. Special emphasis has been provided on horticulture and animal sciences. To provide effective support to the North-East in a concerted thrust, a special recruitment drive was undertaken for the NE, and 50 scientists have been posted there during the year. It is a matter of satisfaction to see the effective dovetailing between national priorities in the Agriculture Sector and ICAR’s programmes, particularly in the current concerns regarding conservation, optimization of resources, commercialization of technology and biotechnology. The initiatives taken during this year will doubtless bear fruit in the future. (AJIT SINGH) President ICAR Society FOREWORD Foreword . . . . . . . . . iii 1. Overview . . . . . . . . . 1 2.
