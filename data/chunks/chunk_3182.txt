Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): Total 26 varieties of different crops ( 8 in mungbean, 3 in urdbean, 6 in fieldpea, 4 in lentil and 5 in rajmash) were identified during last five years. 1. Crop Improvement • Large number of wide crosses, (mungbean x urdbean) were attempted for transfer of plant type traits. A variety IPM 99‐125 (Meha) of mungbean has been released. • Short duration and MYMV resistant mungbean varieties Meha, TM 99‐37, HUM‐12 and HUM 16 and urdbean variety WBU 109 were released for summer/spring cultivation under rice‐wheat system of northern plains. • High yielding varieties COGG 912, OUM 11‐5 (SZ), and NDM 97‐1 (NEPZ) of mungbean for kharif cultivation were developed. • Donors for CLS resistance in mungbean (ML 515, PM 4, PDM 262) and urdbean (K 11‐68, T 65) were identified which are being used in breeding programme • Short duration, heat tolerant and powdery mildew resistant fieldpea varieties (Adarsh, Vikas, Prakash) were released for central zone. • Several high yielding and powdery mildew resistant varieties of fieldpea (HFP 9907 B, VL 42) were also developed for cultivation in northern plains. • Rust resistant lentil varieties KLS 218, HUL 57, VL 507 and IPL 406 were released for North India. • Rajmash varieties Amber, Utkarsh (NEPZ), IPR 98‐3 and HUR 203 (CZ) with BCMV tolerance were developed for rabi cultivation. 2. Crop Production Lentil • Sprouted seeds 0 f lentil sown 1 5 days before the harvest 0 f rice crop increase the lentil yield by 30 percent. www.icar.org.in 57 2002 ‐ 2007 • Utera lentil yield increased by 9% due to two hours seed soaking in 2% KH2P04 . Urdbean • Soil mulch and 2% KCL spray was found effective in urdbean • 2% urea spray at flowering was found effective in urdbean. • Urdbean strains CRU 7 recorded the highest yield across the centers in different years. • Urdbean + Ragi at 2: 1 or 1: 1 row ratio and pre ‐ emergence application of Alachlor @ 2 kg a.i./ha increased the yield in urdbean + ragi intercropping at Pantnagar. • PUR 34 and VRU 7 were promising urdbean Rhizobium strains. • 2% foliar spray of urea at pre‐flowering, flowering and pod development stages increased yield by 28%. Mungbean • Among the mid season drought management practices, mixed spray of 2% KCL+O.l ppm Boron (891 kg/ha) was most effective in mungbean. • Under rainfed situation, addition of 5t/ha FYM increased yield by 35.45% over 40 kg P20s/ha alone in mungbean.
