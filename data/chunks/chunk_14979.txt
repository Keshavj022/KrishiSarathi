 From each village, 30 households were selected through a judgemental sampling technique so that different levels of the size of landholding, asset, income, education, sanitation infrastructure as well as caste and religion are properly represented in the selected sample household. Thus, in total, the present study has 1020 sample households for data collection and analysis (30 households each from 34 villages). However, after careful screening and cleaning of data, the effective sample size is 996. Table 1 Agro-climatic Zones of Odisha. Sl.
