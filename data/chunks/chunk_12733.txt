The annual income of farmer’s household in Telangana is about Rs 75,732 per annum. Crop sector was the major contributor to this farmers’ income which contributes 67.2%. Whereas Horticulture is contributing only 6% where there is lot of potential to increase for doubling overall farmers’ income. Livestock is contributing about Rs. 4488 /annum. Farmers’ income from wages and non-farm business are about Rs. 17400 and Rs 3120 /annum, respectively. As per the strategic document of NITI Aayog, increased crop productivity contributes about 33%, Better price realization contributes about 33% and other sources of income contributes about 33% to the total income of farmers’ income. Among these 3 sources of income, the contribution from enhanced crop productivity can be doubled by adopting successful technology interventions on farmers’ fields in various sectors of agriculture. The contribution from better price realization can be increased by value addition to agricultural produce and linking it to the markets through value chain approach without involvement of middlemen. There is also possibility of enhancing non-farm income of farmers by popularizing multi-enterprise agri- clinics and agribusiness centres in rural areas particularly for rural youth. 1. Present and targeted growth rates in different sectors for doubling agricultural income of farmers by 2022-23.   With current CAGR in agriculture & allied sector the contribution of the sector to GSDP will become 1.47 times by 2022-23.   Targeted CAGRs during 2015-16 to 2022-23 for doubling the contribution by 2022- 23 are presented in Table 6.   The current growth in agriculture (0.02%) is negligible. It can be increased to 5% by diversification to horticultural crops in suitable areas.   The current growth rate of livestock (9.37%) can be increased to 15% as the state government is coming up with livestock mission with Rs. 5000 crore allocation to sheep & goat rearing to bring stability in the livelihoods of small and marginal farmers and rural poor.   The existing growth rate in fisheries (13.88) is impressive. It is further expected to enhance to 16% with the backup of state government for fish culture programme in mission Kakatiya tanks.   Achieving the proposed growth rates will ensure doubling of the contribution of agriculture & allied sector to GSDP.
