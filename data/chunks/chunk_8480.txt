 The minimum benefit: cost ratio was recorded in the conventional broadcast sowing of wheat (2.53). The net income also followed the same trend. The specific energy required was lowest in rotary tillage (1.88 MJ/kg), and for zero tillage, it was 2.05 MJ/kg, because of higher yields. Minimum Phalaris minor population in wheat was recorded under zero tillage Wheat and barley varieties identified Production conditions and area of recommendation Wheat VL 829 Early sown rainfed hilly areas Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Sikkim, West Bengal and north-eastern states HS 420 Late sown rainfed hilly areas of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh Uttaranchal, Sikkim, West Bengal and north-eastern states HS 375 Summer sowing of wheat in snow-bound rainfed hilly areas of Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal PBW 498 Late sown irrigated plain areas of Jammu and Kathua districts, Paonta Valley and Una district of Himachal Pradesh, tarai areas of Uttaranchal, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan (excepting Kota and Udaipur divisions), and western Uttar Pradesh, excluding Jhansi division DBW 14 and Late sown irrigated areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, NW 2036 plains of West Bengal and Assam, and plain areas of north-eastern states MP 4010 Late sown irrigated areas of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Kota and Udaipur divisions of Rajasthan and Jhansi division of Uttar Pradesh HI 1500 Timely sown rainfed areas of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Kota and Udaipur divisions of Rajasthan and Jhansi division of Uttar Pradesh Lok 45 Late sown irrigated areas Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Goa and plains of Tamil Nadu Barley BHS 352 (Huskless- Timely sown rainfed hilly areas of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal naked barley) Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Sikkim, West Bengal and north-eastern states HS 420 wheat has been identified for release for late-sown rainfed hilly areas of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Sikkim, West Bengal and north-eastern states HS 375 wheat. This variety has been identified for summer sowing of wheat in snow-bound rainfed hilly areas of Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal BHS 352. It is an huskless naked barley variety, identified for release for timely-sown rainfed hilly areas of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Sikkim, West Bengal and north- eastern states CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 21 The incidence/damage due to termites and powdery mildew was more under FIRBS, and the attack of foliar aphids and pink stem borer was much less under this. In zero tillage, termite damage and powdery mildew damage was the least, whereas due to pink stem borer was the highest. The pink stem borer generally remains at a low level in wheat, but need is felt to keep a vigil on this important pest under zero-tillage system.
