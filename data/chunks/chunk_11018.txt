 Hence, transportation of the bales up to the safe storage place and the smaller size plants of capacities from 4 to 10 MW power generation may be encouraged. There is some environmental problem with biomass based power plant such as no satisfactory disposal of the ash coming out from plant. The biomass consumption in power plant about 30 tonne/day/MW and ash coming out from the plant is about 4.5 tonne per day/MW plant. Cost Analysis of Biomass based Power Generation Plants Following are the basic information based on which the economic analysis PAU Model – I biogas plant was done: • For cost analysis purpose a biomass based power plant with a capacity of power generation of 18 MW is taken. Fig. 3. Costs and returns as a function of Percentage of initial cost invested by the promoter (` Lakhs) If a subsidy of 40% on the cost of plant and machinery is provided then the net profit for the promoter will be ` 29.80 crores per year. 28 Ex-situ Crop Residue Management Options • Approximate actual production of electricity is 10 crore units (based on power load factor, break downs, number of working hours in a day and 300 days in a year) • Total life of the plant 15 years. • It is assumed that the plant uses 100% paddy straw for power generation. • Cost of plant and machinery for a plant of 18 MW power generation capacity is ` 150 crores. • Number of working days in a year is 300. • Paddy straw consumption by this plant in an year is 1,62,000 tonnes. • Cost of paddy straw ` 2,000 per tonne for baling and transporting to the plant site. Table 10. Summary of costs and quantitative estimates for establishing 1000 for a paddy straw based power generation plants of 18 MW capacity each Sl. No. Particulars Quantitative Values 1. Capacity of the plant 18 MW 2. Electricity produced per year (taking into 10.00 crore units per plant or account 300 days of working per year, power load factor and break downs etc.) 10,000 crore units from 1000 plants 3. Cost of one plant ` 150 crore (` 90 cr by promoter and ` 60 cr support from Government) 4. Operational life of the plant 15 years 5. Sale price ` 8.00 per Unit 6. Net Profit ` 29.80 crores per year 7. Paddy straw consumed per year 0.162 million tonnes per year of operation 8. If 100 such plants are established then 16.2 million tonnes per year the total paddy straw consumed per year 9. Total subsidy for 100 plants at the rate ` 60000 crores of 40% subsidy on the cost of plant and machinery  29 Alcohol Production from Paddy Straw (Lignocellulosic Biomass) G OVT. of India has allowed procurement of ethanol produced from other non-food feedstock besides molasses, like cellulosic and lignocelluloses materials including petrochemicals route, subject to meeting the relevant BIS standards. The next generation of technologies which can produce ethanol from non-food feedstock are being termed as second generation (2G) technologies. The ethanol being produced from these technologies is being termed as “2G Ethanol”.
