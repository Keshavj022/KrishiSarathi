 1976 Large-scale production of FMD vaccine started at Bengaluru campus ICAR-IVRI. 1995 Virus serotyping ELISA developed for FMD. 2000 AICRP on FMD upgraded to Project Directorate on FMD (PD-FMD). 2003 Liquid Phase Blocking ELISA (LPBE) for FMD developed. 2003 Uniform vaccine strain support to industry started. 2004 Multiplex PCR (mPCR) for FMD virus detection developed. 2007 PD-FMD became constituent laboratory of OIE/FAO FMD reference laboratories net- work. 2008 PD-FMD recognized as “FAO reference centre for FMD for south asia”. 2009 PD-FMD became Member Laboratory of Global FMD Research Alliance (GFRA). 2009 Recombinant non-structural protein (3AB3) based ELISA test developed for differen- tiation of FMD infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). 2009 Foundation stone laid for International Centre for FMD (ICFMD), Bhubaneswar. 2010 PD-FMD became SAARC regional leading diagnostic laboratory of FAO. 2013 FMD lateral flow test and ELISA using recombinant antigen developed. 2015 PD-FMD upgraded to ICAR-Directorate of FMD (ICAR-DFMD) 2016 Solid Phase Competitive ELISA (SPCE) developed by ICAR-DFMD. 2017 Inauguration of International Centre for FMD, Bhubaneswar. 2021 ICAR-DFMD recognized as “FAO Reference Centre for FMD”. The FMD Control programme (FMDCP) was launched in 2003-04 in selected districts of India and expanded progressively to cover the entire country in 2017. A large number of FMD outbreaks were encountered prior to FMDCP. The number of FMD outbreaks/ Indian Agriculture after Independence 240 incidences came down by almost 60% (781 from 1911), in 2006/07 and in 2008/09 the number of incidences came down to 245, further ~70% drop in the incidences of the disease. The progressive drop in the incidences of FMD is attributed to the herd immunity. A trend of reduction in FMD outbreaks since implementation of FMDCP in 2003-04 is shown in Fig. 3. Through the application of the indigenous diagnostic kits India saved revenue worth Rs. 531 crores during last one decade. Fig. 3. Reducing trend of FMD outbreaks in India after implementation of control programme 4.1.1. Socio-economic impact of FMD vaccines and diagnostic research To evaluate the benefits of control measures on the production of affected animals, it is necessary to determine the variable effects of FMD including mortality rate (usually very low), reduction in milk production (usually significant), infertility, abortion, delays in attainment of slaughter weight, reduced food conversion efficiency in animals and lameness in bovine draught animals. It was projected that the state of Andhra Pradesh would stand to lose Rs. 1147 crore only on account of direct impacts, if there were no vaccination programme against FMD. The country would incur a total direct loss of Rs. 15575 crore. According to one study, the annual total economic loss due to FMD in India ranges from 12,000 crore to 14,000 crore (Singh et al. 2013).
