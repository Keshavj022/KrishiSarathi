) KOHA for Library Staff of ICAR NAARM, Hyderabad 5 days 36 32 7.3.10 New Training Programme for Guest House Incharges/Caretakers Normally, the Govt. Guest Houses are used by all levels of Officers visiting the Organization/Institution for official business. These Guest Houses are usually maintained by untrained Scientific/Technical/Administrative staff, consequently leading to inefficient management of the Guest Houses with unintentional poor reflection of the Organization. In order to have better sense of hospitality and effective management of Guest Houses, it was realized to train Guest House Incharges/Caretakers of ICAR Guest Houses in collaboration with specialized Training Institute. Therefore first time, a specialized training programme for Guest House Incharges/Caretakers on ìHospitality Managementî in collaboration with Institute of Hotel Management, Catering Technology & Applied Nutrition (IHMCT&AN), Hyderabad was designed, developed and organized by NAARM, Hyderabad during 2018-19. In this programme, 29 Guest House Incharges/Caretakers of ICAR-Institutes participated, out of which 97% attended first time after joining ICAR services. 19 HRM INITIATIVES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF ICAR (2014-18) Training Programme on Hospitality Management 7.3.11 New Training Programme for Stenographer Grades To improve skills and efficiency in discharging functions and providing constructive support in meeting the organizational goals and targets, specialized training programmes for Stenographer Grade ñIII, PA, PS, PPS and Sr. PPS†in the ICAR system were also lacking and had very limited opportunity of capacity building.
