 In addition to the current component of basic and strategic research in agriculture under different areas, based on the recommendations of ICAR Peer Review Committee, Outcome Review of ICAR schemes and Impact Evaluation of Central Sector Schemes of ICAR by Third Party, five new components, viz. Translational Research, Research in International Collaboration, Extramural Grant for Research, Scientific Validation of Farmers’ Innovations and Promoting Agri- Start-ups, was also proposed in SFC memorandum of NASF for the period 2021–22 to 2025–26 for wider coverage, more visibility and outcome of the scheme. A total of 10 new projects were approved during the reporting period. NASF also evaluated the new pre proposals received under seven strategic areas of Call IX the pre proposals and shortlisted 167 pre proposals for seeking the full proposals for further review. One meeting of the Chairpersons of the various expert committees was also held on 6 August, 2021 under the Chairmanship of Secretary, DARE and DG, ICAR for finalization of modalities for funding the projects under Call IX. Salient achievements During 2020–21, besides having more than 55 research publications in reputed journals, NASF had two patents and nine technologies. The research highlights of some selected projects have been summarized here: Phenomics of moisture deficit stress tolerance in rice and wheat: ML and AI aided Computer Vision phenotyping methods such as SpikeSegNet for spike detection and counting in wheat, and leaf tip detection and counting methods in rice were developed at Nanaji Deshmukh Plant Phenomics Centre (NDPPC), New Delhi in collaboration with IASRI, New Delhi and IIT, Mumbai. Analysing 170 RILs of BVD109 × IR20 of rice for component traits of transpiration and WUE, three QTLs, viz. qWUE8.3 & qWUE 6.1 & qWUE 6.2 for WUE with PVE of 17.43%, 10.32% and 16.98%, respectively, were mapped on chromosome 8 and 6 under irrigated conditions. Three QTLs for day time WUE (qWUEd6.2 & qWUEd8.4 qWUEd11.5) located very close in the same location with high PVE of 17.15, 18.39, and 10.16%, respectively were separated. QTL related to night time WUE was mapped on chromosome 8 (qWUEn8.2) with high PVE% of 13.02%. Under drought stress, two QTLs for whole day transpiration rate (qTRBM6.3 & qTRPSA6.4) were mapped on chromosome 6 with high PVE value of 31.84 and 34.12%, respectively. These QTLs will be useful to elucidate molecular basis and genetic improvement of WUE in rice. Genome editing for improvement of drought and salt tolerance in rice: Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, a Zinc finger transcription factor was developed for improving salt and drought tolerance in rice. When wild type (wt) plants and dst mutants were exposed to three cycles of –90 kPa drought stress about 25% wt plants survived, while dst mutants showed 100% survival. The dst mutants produced significantly higher yield than wt plants under both non-stress and drought stress conditions.
