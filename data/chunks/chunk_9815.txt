 A few biofortified cultivars with higher iron and zinc content along with high grain yield were released for farmers. Since 2018, AICRP-Pearl Millet has set a minimum 42 mg/kg of iron and 32 mg/kg of zinc for promoting entries in the trials and cultivar release. Presently, many high yielding cultivars having moderate to high iron and zinc content are available to the farmers for cultivation (Table 2). Sorghum Sorghum is the second cheapest source of energy and micronutrients after pearl millet. Sorghum consumption, especially by low and middle-income rural consumers, is high in the major production regions of inland central and eastern regions of Maharashtra and inland northern region of Karnataka. In terms of nutrient intake, sorghum accounts for about 35% of the Table 2.

Hence, biofortification of sorghum is a promising strategy to alleviate iron and zinc deficiency in these rural areas of dryland. Wide variability for grain iron (12–68 mg/kg) and zinc (11–44 mg/kg) has been observed among the cultivars and germplasm lines.
