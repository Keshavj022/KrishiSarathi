Based on the agronomic performance, Cry toxin expression, reaction to sucking pests diseases and fibre quality parameters, eight were ICAR-CICR Rajat Bt ICAR-CICR Bt 14 (CPT 2) CROP IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2018–19 51 approved and released for commercialization. Seven of them were developed by ICAR-CICR and one (PAU- 1) Bt was developed by PAU, Ludhiana. Varieties developed through marker assisted selection: Seven varieties of rice, viz. CO 43 Sub-1 (IET 25676), DRR Dhan 51 (IET 25484), Punjab Basmati-4 (RYT 3404) (IET-25399), Punjab Basmati- 5 (RYT 3432) (IET-26153), Ranjit Sub-1, Bahadur Sub-1, Pusa Samba 1850 (IET 25480) (Pusa 1850-27) have been developed by using the modern molecular tools. These varieties have resistance/tolerance to various biotic (blast and bacterial blight) and abiotic (flood/sub-mergence) stresses which has introgressed through marker assisted backcross breeding. Quality enhancement Biofortified varieties developed: Eight biofortified varieties of various crops including rice, wheat, maize, pearl millet and lentil have been released and notified during 2018. DRR Dhan 48 (IET 24555) and DRR Dhan 49 (IET 24557) are high zinc (25.2 ppm) rice varieties. Three wheat varieties, viz. MACS 4028 (d) [high protein (14.7%), iron (46.1 ppm) and zinc (40.3 ppm)], Pusa Wheat 8777 (HI 8777) [Iron (48.7 ppm), zinc (43.6 ppm)] and UAS-334 [high protein (13.3%) and zinc (43.1 ppm)] have also been released. Two pearl millet hybrids, viz. AHB 1200 Fe (MH 2072) (AHB 1200) hybrid [high iron (77 ppm) and zinc (39 ppm)] and HHB 299 (MH 2076) [high iron (73 ppm) and zinc (41 ppm)] and lentil variety IPL 220 with high concentration of Fe, Zn and Se have been released and notified. Micro level tests for quality traits in wheat: Micro level tests were developed for gluten strength and yellow pigment content. These tests are very useful in predicting the quality in early segregating generations when small quantity of materials is available and short time is left in between next sowing.
