Cropping Systems • Intercropping of groundnut + pigeonpea (11: 1) for insurance against risk in arid alfisols of Anantapur spread to more than 50% in this groundnut predominant district. This additionally generated almost Rs.31.5 crores in this region. In a limited area of 100 ha, pigeonpea was taken as sole crop during 2002‐03, which was not a practice hitherto. • Contingent crop plans for in arid shallow alfisols of Anantapur prompted district administration and Department of Agriculture to play a prominent role in procuring and supplying seed of sorghum, pearlmillet and horsegram based on the indents of the farmers.
