In this direction, at our institute, recently we have imported nearly over 60 lines of tomato from the World Vegetable Centre, Tiawan, and the Tomato Genetics Resource Centre, UC Davis, USA for breeding purpose. Further, we have characterized in-house breeding materials suitable for processing traits and selected a few lines for future trials. Challenges and way forward Worldwide tomato is mainly consumed as fresh vegetable (89%) and only ~11% is processed. However, in India, utilization of tomato in processing sector is very low (< 1%), and per capita consumption of processed tomato is only 200 g. Hence, there is a huge scope to utilize tomato in the form of processed products such as tomato crush, pulp, paste, puree, ketchup, canned products, etc. Hence, there is a need of varieties suitable for processing. A few major Indian companies involved in tomato processing are M/s Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (Kissan), M/s Field Fresh Foods Pvt. Ltd. (Del Monte), M/s Nestle India (Maggi), M/s Dabur India (Hommade), M/s GD Foods Mfg. (India) Pvt. Ltd. (Tops), etc. In our country, processing capacity is very less (30-600 tonnes per day) and it is seasonal also, compared to the developed country like USA (59000 tonnes per day, California). There are several issues associated with development of processing varieties and successful establishment of processing industries in the country, a few of them are listed below, which requires multi-dimensional approach to augment processing industry in India. yy Strengthen genetic resources from national and international genebanks. yy Public-private partnership research for processing tomato varieties (open-pollinated and hybrids). yy Large scale field evaluations of available varieties/ hybrids. yy Breeding for high yielding varieties suitable for processing round the year.
