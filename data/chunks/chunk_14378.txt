Despite these complexities, it is recognized that remittances can play a significant role in the economic development of the source re­ gions, especially in rural areas in this context (Hidayati, 2020). They serve as an essential source of funding, supporting livelihoods and economic activities in rural areas(Chintamani & Kulkarni, 2023). It is also evident that the quantity of migrant remittances received by developing countries has expanded dramatically over the last decade and has played an essential role in rural development in many ways (Mabrouk & Mekni, 2018). Remittances to India have increased dramatically since 1991, propelling the nation to the top of the devel­ oping world’s remittance recipient list (Gupta, 2006). According to the latest World Migration Report by the United Nations, India topped the list of countries receiving remittances from abroad, with a total of $111 billion in 2022. This amount significantly surpassed that of its nearest competitors, including Mexico ($61.1 billion), China ($51 billion), the Philippines ($38.05 billion), and France ($30.04 billion)(Ghosh, 2024). These remittances, along with other development aspects such as con­ tributions to savings or business investments, often help grow local agricultural activities and enhance the welfare and livelihood of recip­ ient households by providing necessities such as food, clothing, improved health and education, and human and social capital. (Xing, 2018). See (Fig. 1). Remittance inflows can provide smallholder farmers with access to capital, which they can use to purchase seeds, fertilizers, and other necessary inputs for successful crop production. Previously, many studies have been carried out in several developing countries like China, Nepal, Bhutan, Philippines, and some Latin American and African countries. A study by Atamanov and van den Berg (2012) says remittances generally result in higher crop earnings for most farmers, except those who own the most land. Another important study (Vasco et al., 2016) focused on the impact of international migration and re­ mittances on agricultural production patterns in rural Ecuador. The study says families with members who migrated abroad tend to use remittance to purchase fertilizers to compensate for the decreased available labour due to migration. A study investigated remittances’ impact on agricultural labour productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using panel data from 39 countries (2000–2016), they found that remittances had a strong negative impact on agricultural labour productivity (Wonyra & Ametoglo, 2020). Another study (Ghimire & Kapri, 2020) also conducted similar research in Nepal.
