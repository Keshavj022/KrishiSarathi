Gitanjali Naik, her gross annual income gradually increased from a meagre ` 81,300 in 2016-17 to an inconceivable `6,08,300 i.e., over seven times in 2022- 23 by adopting various new and innovative farm enterprises like HYV and hybrid rice varieties, hybrid vegetables on a commercial scale, tissue culture banana, tapioca and yam tuber crops, backyard poultry, and improved management of non-descript desi cows and goats. Her annual net profit during 2020- 21 reached about `2,24,300, which was slightly affected due to the coronavirus pandemic, but recovered in the succeeding years and increased to `4,13,100 in 2022-23. Economics and Impact Indian Farming 54 November 2024 she is a successful farmer and has become a role model for other farmers and farm women in the village as well as neighbouring villages. Out of the money savings, she has completely renovated and expanded her house and made a pucca house adding some comfort facilities. Now-a-days, she is much more confident in facing life’s challenges and more happy with her small family than ever before. CONCLUSION The beneficiary farmwoman Smt Gitanjali Naik used to get a meagre annual income of ~ ` 19,000- 24,000 only by growing local rice varieties and rearing one desi cow before the FFP was implemented in 2016- 17. She was facing major problems like low crop and water productivity, poor irrigation facilities, no crop diversification, no crop rotation and lack of knowledge in farming, etc. With doubling farmers’ income (DFI) interventions like high-yielding and hybrid rice varieties, line transplanting, partial farm mechanization, hybrid vegetable cultivation, use of polythene mulching, irrigation management, rearing of backyard poultry and addition of two more desi non-descript cattle, she was able to multiply her annual income over seven times to get `6,08,300/annum in just six to seven years. In addition, there is a cost saving of about ` 50,000 annually in the production of rice and vegetables on account of the adoption of proper management practices with respect to irrigation scheduling, balanced dose of fertilizer, need-based application of pesticides and mechanical weed control.
