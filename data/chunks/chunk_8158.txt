14 kg, 303.2 days and 10.6 kg in Kankrej; and 1,462.67, 9.74 and 268.97 days in Sahiwal, respectively. The first set of six Gir and eight Kankrej bulls were evaluated based on the first lactation 305 days milk yield of their daughters and the expected breeding values were estimated as 2,563.79 and 2,004.31 kg, respectively. Field recording of performance data: The project envisages to progeny test Frieswal (HF × Sahiwal) bulls under field conditions at four different agro- climatic locations in India having a larger concentration of HF cross cows. A total of 309, 292, 286 and 96 bulls have so far been introduced in GADVASU, Ludhiana; KVASU, Thrissur; BAIF, Uruli-Kanchan; and GBPUA&T, Pantnagar, respectively. During the year, a total of 3737, 5163, 4508 and 5651 AIs were carried out in GADVASU, Ludhiana; KVASU, Thrissur; BAIF, Uruli- Kanchan; and GBPUA&T, Pantnagar; with the conception percentages of 46.2, 46.0, 42.6 and 61.2, respectively. The number of daughters completed their first lactation in GADVASU, Ludhiana; KVASU, Thrissur; BAIF, Uruli-Kanchan; and GBPUA&T, Pantnagar, were 4,013, 1,807, 3,563 and 490, respectively. In all the four centres, the first lactation milk production showed an increasing trend over the years as 39.7, 51.2, 11.14 and 32.58% while the age at first calving has recorded per cent decrease of 12.23, 9.87, 2.3 and 5.5 in GADVASU, KVASU, BAIF and GBPUA&T, Pantnagar, respectively. Buffalo Network Project on Buffalo Improvement: Test mating from 16th set of 15 test bulls (5 from CIRB Hisar; 4 from NDRI Karnal; 3 from GADVASU Ludhiana; and 3 from LUVAS Hisar) was completed and; thereafter use of 16 test bulls (8 from CIRB Hisar, 4 from GADVASU Ludhiana, 2 from NDRI Karnal and 2 bulls from field) of 17th set was initiated, which will continue during the reported period through associated centres of Murrah breed under the project. The total herd strength including associated Murrah breed centres is 1,951, which includes 1,054 breedable females. The weighted average of 305 days or lesser lactation milk yield in the year was highest ever (2,487 kg) since inception of the project and showed an overall improvement of 52.38% since 1992–93 (2.01% per year). The weighted wet average was also highest (8.55 Gir cattle A flock of Kankrej cattle                                  An essential component of the agriculture in achieving food security for all is preserving, processing and value adding the raw produce in the postharvest chain. Value- addition and preservation in postharvest chain would help making available healthier and nutritious food choices for the consumers throughout the year; reducing postharvest losses, and creating employment opportunities. Processing equipment Sugarcane-rind removing equipment for juice making: Rind peeling enhances quality and hygiene of sugarcane juice as it enables the removal of dirt and other unwanted particles as well as microbial load from the stalk in juice.
