 We estimated opportunity costs to participants of attending dissemi- nation meetings and follow-up home visits by using data on the total number of group attendants and follow-up home visits per intervention arm (from facilitator registers and home visit forms); mean durations of group meetings and home visits, and mean travel time to the meeting location (collected in the UPAVAN endline survey); and the minimum daily wage of an agricultural worker in Odisha state (303 Indian Rupees or US$4.31) (37) (Supplemental Material Table S2). We estimated cost to households of adopting practices promoted in UPAVAN as any differences in the following expenditures: seeking healthcare (out-of-pocket fees and transport costs paid for child and maternal healthcare from public, private, or informal healthcare providers), agricultural inputs, food costs, and nonfood costs.
