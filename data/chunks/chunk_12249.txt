 • In 55 trials, the proposed variety HD 3086 appeared 24 times in first non-significant group as compared to check varieties DBW 17 (14/55), DPW 621-50 (20/45), HD 2967(10/21) and WH 1105 (10/21). It has shown consistent performance over the years and the locations. The variety has shown highest number of ear-heads/m2 and 1,000- kernel weight in agronomic trials. • The proposed variety HD 3086 showed very high degree of resistance against loose smut and flag smut as compared to all check and qualifying varieties • It has the best HMW sub-units combination for bread-making with Glu-1 score, 10/10. The proposed variety has the best grain appearance score, hecto-litre weight, higher value of bread loaf volume (cc) and bread- quality score. The variety, therefore, may find favour with bread-making industries. • The proposed variety has highest extraction rate (70.5), chapati score (7.65) and wet gluten percentage (31.3), and, therefore, may also find favour with milling and baking industries. 160 GUIDELINES FOR TESTING CROP VARIETIES UNDER AICCIPS Proposal for Release of Wheat Variety HD 3086 (Pusa Gautami) to the Central Sub-committee on Crop Standards Notification and Release of Varieties 1 Name of the crop and species : Wheat, Triticum aestivum L. 2 a) Name of the variety under which tested : HD 3086 in AICRP trials b) Proposed name of the variety : Pusa Gautami 3 Sponsored by (institute) : Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi 110 012 4 a) Institution or agency responsible for developing : Division of Genetics, Indian Agricultural Research variety (with full address) Institute, New Delhi110 012 b) Name of the person who helped in the development : Individuals listed by order of contribution as decided of the variety by the Programme/Institutional Leadership Developers Collaborators 5 a) Parentage (with details of its pedigree including : DBW 14/HD 2733//HUW 468(Annexures-I, II) the source from which variety/Inbred/ A, B and R lines of hybrid has been developed) b) Source of material in case of introduction : NA c) DNA profile of variety/hybrid/inbred/A, B, R (Annexures-III,IV) lines of the hybrid vis-à-vis check variety/ line d) Breeding method used : Modified Pedigree Bulk Method e) Breeding objective : Breeding wheat varieties with stripe and leaf rust resistance and higher productivity under timely sown conditions of the North Western Plains Zone 6 State the varieties which most closely resemble : HD 3086 falls in the height group of HD 2329, HD the proposed variety in general characters 2687 and PBW 343.
