 Similarly, the Indian Bottle gourd is also a unique vegetable crop in India. It has a distinctive shape, and is typically used in curries and stews. It is a popular vegetable in southern India and is often used in sambar and other traditional dishes. Contributions from ICAR-IIVR, Varanasi: Given here. Cluster bearing sponge gourd “VRSG-52-1” INGR- 10159: This is the first report in which cluster bearing cultivars and hybrids in sponge gourd are being used. SA-90: A high carotenoid content pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata) genotype (IGNR No. – 05027): The genotype SA-90 has 14.85 mg (100 g edible portion) carotenoid and was considered as a promising line for carotenoid followed by Pumpkin-111 (14.19 mg), BP-14 (13.61 mg) and IVPK-226 (13.08 mg). SA-90 is vigorous in vine growth. The single plant bears 1.6 fruits, having the fruit weight 4.0-5.15 kg. The flesh colour of the fruit is dark yellow and 3.5 cm thick. The shape of the fruit is oblong round having the 3-5 month storage capacity at ambient room temperature. B-159: Downy mildew resistance genotype of snapmelon (Cucumis melo var. momordica): (IGNR No. 07044): Genotype was evaluated under epiphytic field conditions during summer and B-184 and B-159 were observed to be highly resistant and again planted in the glass house with susceptible lines and inoculated with spores at seedling stage. The coefficient of infection value was 0 and 1.2 for B-159 and B-184 is easily crossable with muskmelon, and can be utilized for development of resistant hybrid and variety. The fruit of B-159 are long (35-40 cm) with dark green colour and having 7.5-8 cm diameter. The average weight varied from 0.8-1 kg at mature stage and bear 3-4 fruit/plant. Gynoecious bitter gourd: Gy 63 (IC296539; INGR No. 03037): It is a first gynoecious genetic stock in bitter gourd. Gynoecious sex expression is stable. Its plants are very vigorous and bear light green leaves of medium to big size. The flowering starts from 7th node within 45 to 48 days of seeding and fruits attain edible maturity in 64 days (8-10 days after fruit set). Fruits are attractive green in colour and attain a length up to 15 cm and a diameter of 3.55 cm. Average individual fruit weight is 75-100 g. An average of 30 fruits per plant can be harvested. It possesses good keeping quality with more flesh. Seedless pointed gourd IIVRPG-105 (IC296492; INGR No. 03035): It is an obligate parthenocarpic long duration fruiting genetic stock with seedless fruits. Fruits of the selected line were found free from seeds not only at edible stage but also at mature stage. Morphologically, this line has medium sized orbicular and un-lobed light green leaves having 10-15 cm length with rough surface. Plants attain a height of more than 3.0 m. Fruiting starts at 7th node and continues up to full plant growth stage. Fruits are medium in size, light green, striped, elliptical in shape and pointed. The flesh of fruit is light whitish. Length of fruit ranges 5.21 cm.
