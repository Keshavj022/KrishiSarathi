 AICPMIP attained the status from deficit to surplus in the development of new CMS lines. Development of diversified CMS lines on A4 cytoplamsic source is in progress E. Pearl millet germplasm • In collaboration with NBPGR, New Delhi seed of 93 germplasm accessions was multiplied in kharif 2002 and summer 2003 and deposited with NBPGR Hyderabad. Seed of 190 accessions received from NBPGR, Regional Station, Hyderabad were evaluated during kharif 2004. Seeds of 1930 germplasm accessions were also planted and multiplied during kharif 2004 and seed of 1845 accessions were deposited with NBPGR, Regional Station, Jodhpur. In addition 91 accessions were collected from Jalore, Rajasthan for high fodder yield. The same were evaluated at ICRISAT Hyderabad during summer 2005. www.icar.org.in 64 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science • Seed of 329 and 270 germplasm accessions were planted at 9 different locations viz. Hisar, Durgapura, Mandor, Jamnagar, Gwalior, Dhule, Aurangabad, Coimbatore and Palem during kharif 2003 and 2005, respectively. The accessions were evaluated for morphological characters and the trait specific agronomically superior lines were identified for distribution at the national level. F. Grain quality • During 2003‐06, entries in different multilocation trials (IHT, AHT, IPT, AHPT, RHVT, PHT‐ NATP) were tested for protein (% dry weight) and fat (% dry weight). Protein ranged from 8.05 to 11.97 in IHT, 7.43 to 11.11 in ATH, 7.08 to 9.62 in IPT, 10.58 to 11.19 in APT, 9.62 to 12.33 in AHPT, 8.66 to 13.30 in RHVT and 9.45 to 13.12 in PHT‐NATP. • Varieties or hybrids with more than 13% protein included GHB 558, PB 106 and MH 1222. Fat per cent ranged from 4.65 to 7.65. Approximately 18 hybrids or varieties had more than 7.0 per cent fat during 2003‐04. During 2004‐05, varieties or hybrids had more than 13% protein included Pusa 23, PB 106, MH 1097, MH 1152, MH 1153. Hybrids MH 1244 and HHB 94 had more than 7% fat. A few hybrids/ varieties (MH 1280, MH 1304, Raj 171, Pusa 383) having more than 12 per cent protein have been identified during 2005‐06 G. Breeder seed production • During 2002‐2003, breeder seed production programme was organized to meet the indent of DAC for supply of 12.62 q breeder seed of 30 parental lines and 10 varieties. • Approximately 39.12 q breeder seed of 26 parental lines of hybrids and 9 varieties was produced during kharif 2003 for supply in the year 2004‐05 as against a total indent of 11.65 q of the Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, New Delhi. • Thirty one quintal breeder seed of 39 parental lines of hybrids and 12 varieties were produced during 2004 for supply in the year 2005‐06 as against a total indent of 13.17 q. • Approximately 34.0 quintal breeder seed of 36 parental lines of hybrids and 10 varieties were produced during 2005 for supply in the year 2006‐07 as against a total indent of 13 q. 2.
