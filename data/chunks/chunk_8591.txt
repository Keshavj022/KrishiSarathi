 DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 106 Performance of Frizzle cross, IC-3 and IR-4: The programme for introgression of frizzle into broiler completed fifth generations of back crossing. The overall mean body weight of Frizzle × SDL and SDL × Frizzle crosses at 5 weeks of age were 922.0 ± 13.7 and 925 ± 8.5 g, respectively. The averages of body weights at 5 weeks of age in IR-3 and IC-3 were 828.5 ± 18.71 and 843.3 ± 11.02 g, respectively All India Coordinated Research Project on Poultry The synthetic dam line of the CARI centre showed positive genetic response of 16.85 and 24.13 g for body weight at 4 and 6 weeks of age, respectively. At the PAU, Ludhiana, the body weight of female line was 1,207 g at 6 weeks of age and they matured by 162 days of age and produced on an average 99.6 eggs by 52 weeks of age. The average egg weight at 40 weeks of age was 56.1 g. At the UAS center, Bangalore, the average body weight was 94.6 g at 5 weeks of age in S7 generation. These birds matured at 172 days of age and produced 72 eggs by the end of 40 weeks, with an average egg weight of 56.2 g. The dam line maintained at the OUAT centre recorded 1,407 g and 1,164 g body weights in males and females, respectively, at 6 weeks of age. They matured at 180 days of age and produced on an average 47.23 eggs, and the eggs weighed 58.4 g at 40 weeks. At the JNKVV, Jabalpur, the existing purebred dwarf line, and three dwarf crosses were maintained and tested. Coloured and white dam line from the CARI and a single dam line from the PD on Poultry were utilized to produce the crosses of dwarfs at this centre. The mean body weight at 6 weeks of age was 580 g in pure dwarfs and 910 g, 882 g and 872 g in the 3 crosses with dwarfs. Compared to G2 generation an improvement of 20 g in body weight was achieved in dwarf pure line at 6 weeks of age. During the last 3 generations, the phenotypic response for 4 and 6 week body weight was 26 g and 17 g/generation. The egg production of dwarf dams improved by 1.8 and 3 eggs/generation, respectively, for 40 and 72 weeks of age and, the trend was in the desirable direction. The egg weight improved by 0.4 g/generation. The egg production of dwarfs in G 3 generation up to 40 weeks of age was 60, with average egg weight of 43.3 g and 53.6 g at 28 and 40 weeks of age, respectively. The egg production in the 3 crosses was 56 and 62 for the 2 crosses at CARI and 54 for PDP combination. Compared to the pure dwarfs the egg weight of crosses was higher at 28 and 40 weeks of age. The crosses evaluated at the CARI, PAU, UAS and OUAT centers, produced promising results in RSPPT conducted at Bangalore, Mumbai and Gurgaon. CARI- Bro-Vishal recorded 1,484 g and 1,866 g body weights, respectively, at 6 and 7 weeks of age with corresponding feed efficiency of 2.19 and 2.33 and yielded a margin of Rs 20.63 and Rs 23.56 over feed cost. The entry from UAS achieved 1,407 g and 1,734 g at 6 and 7 weeks of age and ranked second.
