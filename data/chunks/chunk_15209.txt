Overall, the relative costs were reduced by 17% in organic farming in both paddy and soybean, while they were reduced by 14% for wheat. Gross revenue (production × price) was also reduced to 8–9% among organic farmers compared to conventional farmers. However, the proﬁtability of organic farmers was increased marginally by 3.2% in soybean, 5.6% in paddy and just 0.2% in wheat. However, yields were reduced by 9% in soybean, 8% in paddy and 6% in wheat in organic agriculture compared to conventional agriculture. Manure use was increased by 20% to 50% depending on the crop. Farmers opine that organic produce fetches higher prices if sold as packaged and branded products or sold to known people within the village. However, if there is no proper labelling and certiﬁcation, then the market price is the same as buyers cannot distinguish between organic and conventional foods. The results were similar to other studies in developing countries [33,34]. The farmers did not convert the entire holdings into organic farming, but only in a small portion of the farm holding, primarily in food grains and legumes for home consumption. The production was sometimes channeled to locally known consumers, fetching relatively higher prices. The tabular analysis results were conﬁrmed by the regression analysis shown in Table 3. The agrochemical use in rainfed, hilly and tribal areas was much lower compared to the irrigated farming system, therefore, the conversion to organic agriculture need not result in a sharp yield decrease. However, in irrigated regions, the yield decrease was sharper, as noted in the case of wheat in Punjab.
