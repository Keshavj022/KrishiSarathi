 Processed fish are liked more by local people. 2. The people in Badaun district did not like processed fish even after 12 hours in comparison to unprocessed fish till it is spoiled. 3. Processed fish did not indicate much reduction (only 20%) in marketability, quality, consumability as well as in market rates even after 18 hours, whereas unprocessed fish indicated heavy reduction (about 80%). Even after 24 hours the reduction was 30% in case of processed fish, whereas it was 100% in case of unprocessed fish. 4. Though the processed fish were not liked by Badaun people, they retained the liking at almost same level, whereas in case of unprocessed fish there was 100% loss after 24 hours.

Fresh darhee fish are given in Table 3 along with the proximate analysis of untreated samples of one species of fish at two intervals. The results of microbial analysis of four species treated fish after 24 hours are also given in Table 4. The results obtained on proximate and microbial analysis indicate that: i. The loss in dry matter, calcium and phosphorus is reduced by smoking treatment of fish. ii. There is no difference in crude protein after smoking treatment of fish. iii. Smoking does not adversely affect the Fig. 4. Smoked darhee fish Fig. 5. Different fish species treated with jalebi colour Table 3.
