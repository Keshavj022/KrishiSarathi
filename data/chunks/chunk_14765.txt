 But farmers are not mere ‘utility maximizers’, even when they have complete autonomy over their operations” (Davidson, 2016, p. 434). Interdisciplinary scholarship, embedding insights from anthropol­ ogy, political science, psychology, and rural sociology, suggest that farmers’ decision-making is more complex and situated in socio- economic and ecological contexts than otherwise suggested by “rational” or economically-driven heuristics (e.g., Nielsen and Reen­ berg, 2010; Davidson, 2016). Adaptation behaviors and outcomes are shaped by social, economic, and cultural structures, objectives, and opportunities (Risbey et al., 1999; Grothmann and Patt, 2005; Nielsen and Reenberg, 2010; Marshall et al., 2012; Curry et al., 2015; Shah, 2015; Burnham and Ma, 2018; Few et al., 2020). Indeed, farmers often have alternative agricultural livelihood objectives, such as self-sufficiency, food security, and social mimicry (Allen and Bernhardt, 1995; McGuire et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2009), and enact their beliefs, values, and norms to guide their decision-making processes (e.g., Carr, 2019; Kuehne, 2014; Arbuckle et al., 2015). This indicates that the Homo economicus decision-making framework, alone, cannot adequately cap­ ture the complex and situated social, economic, and ecological contexts that inform farmers’ adaptation practices (Davidson, 2016). While progress has been made in incorporating alternative decision heuristics in adaptation models based on a rich body of economic, cognitive, and psychological theories (An, 2012; Balke and Gilbert, 2014; Groeneveld et al., 2017), application of such decision-making theories is limited both due to challenges in the identification and se­ lection of theories that fit the context, and the broad assumptions that need to be made to formulate decision-making in models using these theories (An, 2012). Further, difficulties in mathematical formalization of theories in computational modeling often leads to the possibility of varied interpretations of results (Schulze et al., 2017). The consequences of behavioral assumptions behind adaptation decisions remain under­ explored. Scholars, such as Schlüter et al. (2017), advocate for over­ coming such challenges by modeling alternative decision-making theories and validating the theoretical assumptions in adaptation decision-making using empirical data. Given these existing challenges and opportunities, computational Agent-Based Models (ABMs) offer a promising avenue for exploring underlying assumptions in the formu­ lation of decision-making in agricultural adaptation models, with sig­ nificant application for informing public policy. In this paper, we synthesize household survey and geo-spatial data to develop an empirically driven ABM (henceforth, “AG-ADAPT” [Agrarian Adaptation]), that simulates past adaptation decisions of 959 farming households in the northern state of Bihar, India.
