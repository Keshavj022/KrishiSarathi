Scope of cultivation in hills The cultivation of tree tomato can have great prospects in the hill. In hills, these tomato trees are grown between the altitudes 1500 to 2000 m above mean sea level. The tree tomato in this region can be seen in Almora, Bhowali, Bhimtal, Nainital, Mukteshwar, Lamgara, Pithoragarh areas. The processing of these tomatoes is tough in the hills. It is used for the preparation of Jam, Jelly, pickles, chutneys, etc. Therefore, setting up food preservation units/ processing factories in hills can enhance the employment rate in hills, which in turn can reduce the migration of youngsters from hills. It can easily fruit in greenhouses; therefore, the economy of hill farmers can be increased by the cultivation of tree tomato.
