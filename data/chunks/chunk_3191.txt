, ICMH 356, PB 106, SAMH 166, SABURI, SHARADA, RAJ 171 were highly resistant with the disease reaction of 4.00, 3.72, 4.13, 4.33, 2.91 and 4.18%. • A total of nine hybrids and local cultivars were noticed during the farmer’s field survey in Jaipur, Alwar, Sikar, Tonk Nagaur, Jodhpur, Pali, Barmer and Jalore districts of Rajasthan state. The maximum downy mildew incidence was noticed on hybrid cultivar JKBH26, Kanchan, Malav check311, Sriram and Pioneer 7686 recorded 2‐3% disease incidence. For Smut disease the maximum incidence noticed in Bioseed8469 with disease incidence of 12.6% and the same hybrid recorded 3.4% ergot disease. In Alwar district maximum disease incidence was recorded in ICTP8203 followed by JKBH26 with disease incidence of 5% and remaining cultivars Pioneer 7688, Proagro9330 and Unknown hybrids were completely free form downy mildew disease, the maximum smut disease incidence of 10.6% was recorded in JKBH26, followed by unknown hybrid (7.2%). All the hybrids survey in Alwar district was completely free from ergot disease. In Sikar and Tonk district the maximum downy mildew incidence in local cultivars (6‐7%) and Pioneer7686 (3‐4%) in Sikar and Tonk respectively. Maximum smut incidence was recorded in Sikar with 6.2% disease in HHB67 and local cultivars in Sikar district and in Tonk the maximum smut disease was recorded in ICMH356 with 57% smut disease. • In summer disease screening trial, At 60 DAS, seven entries viz., MSH165, MSH166, MSH171, MSH177, MSH178, MSH179, MSH184 and PUSA23 recorded disease incidence of 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.9, 0.5, 2.5 and 0.4% respectively. Only two entries MSH152 and MSH162 recorded disease incidence of 0.5 and 6.0%, respectively. 2005‐06 • Thirty one entries were found resistant to downy mildew disease in PMPT‐I. Among them four entries MH 1336, MH 1364, MH 1392 & Pusa 383 were also resistant to smut, ergot and blast. MH 1362 was resistant to smut, ergot and blast but recorded 23.59% rust. The entry MH 1351 was resistant to smut, ergot and rust but recorded 11.25% blast incidence • Twenty eight entries were found highly resistant followed by 34 entries as resistant and six entries susceptible to downy mildew disease in PMPT‐II • In monitoring disease resistant stability of released popular hybrids, varieties, A, B and R lines in PMPT‐III, none of the tested entries showed 0.0 per cent disease incidence in zone A. However in zone B, ICMH 356 recorded 0.0 per cent downy mildew incidence • Studies on characterization of pathogen diversity in downy mildew of pearl millet included pathogenic diversity analysis by virulence nursery and genetic analysis through DNA marker. Biological pathotyping indicates variation in resistance in the pathogenic population of S.
