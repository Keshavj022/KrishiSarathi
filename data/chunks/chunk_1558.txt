 For example, drought or erratic rainfall can lead to increased pest pressure, Indian Farming 72 January 2025 and advisories can recommend pest management strategies such as timely application of biopesticides or integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. Soil and nutrient management advisories • Soil health monitoring: Continuous weather monitoring, combined with soil moisture sensors, can provide advisory services on the optimal time for fertilizer application to avoid nutrient leaching during heavy rains or maximize absorption during dry spells. • Nutrient management under drought: Recommendations on applying nutrient solutions that help plants cope with drought stress and maintain productivity under water-limited conditions. Livestock management in extreme weather • Heat stress alerts: Advisories for protecting livestock during heatwaves, such as increasing water intake, providing shade, and altering feeding schedules to reduce heat-related stress. • Flood and cold wave protection: Guidance on shelter management for livestock during extreme weather events, with specific advice on maintaining health and nutrition in stressful conditions. Training and capacity building • Farmer awareness programs: Regular workshops, farmer field schools, and training sessions to enhance farmers’ understanding of weather patterns, interpretation of advisories, and adoption of climate-resilient practices. • SMS and Mobile app-based advisories: Use of digital platforms to disseminate agromet advisories, allowing farmers to receive real-time, location- specific advice on extreme weather events and appropriate responses. SUMMARY In India, climate variability and extreme weather events affect the agricultural livelihood systems negatively. In our country, the National Agricultural Research Service is actively involved in research and extension services to improve the livelihood of the farming community. State-level policymakers and officials of the line department are using the crop contingency measures prescribed by ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture for giving advisory and actions. Timely and accurate agromet advisories can be a game changer if they can reach all the farmers of the country. Leveraging nowcasting to develop short-term agromet advisories for events like cloudbursts, hailstorms, and flash floods has the potential to be a transformative approach for agriculture in India over the coming decade. With the giant leap in computing power and the advent of artificial intelligence, it is envisaged that the accuracy of weather forecasts will improve shortly, which will further aid in agromet advisories based on nowcasting and help in reducing the negative impacts due to extreme weather events. *Corresponding author email: santanu.bal@icar.gov.in Fisheries is a sunrise sector with varied resources and potentials.
