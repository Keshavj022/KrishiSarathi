 Pigeon pea   Varieties for light soils: PRG-176, PRG-158, LRG - 52, TRG-59 and ICPL 84031; medium to heavy soils: LRG-41, ICPL 85063, ICPL-87119, BSMR-786 and LRG-105.   Application of 60kg/ha potash and 25kg/ha zinc fertilizers as a basal. Seed treatment with bio- fertilizers like rhizobium & PSB   Intercrops: foxtail millet (5:1), pearl millet (2:1), sorghum (2:1) and castor (2:1). If early rains are received during July intercrop with groundnut, bajra and sorghum. If late rains are received after August intercrop with fodder pearl millet, fodder sorghum, greengram, cowpea and horse gram. If rain is received after 15 September, intercrop with fodder sorghum, fodder pearl millet and horse gram. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 145   Treat seeds with carbendazim 50 WP @ 1.5 g followed by T. viride @ 8-10 g / kg to control wilt Sesame   Sowing sesame with the available soil moisture up to June 30th. Select high yielding varieties like Hima, Sarada (YLM 66) and YLM-17. If available, provide one life-saving irrigation at 30 DAS. Greengram and Blackgram   Cultivate YMV resistant, greengram varieties LGG-460, LGG-450, IPM-2-14, WGG 42 and blackgram varieties TBG-104, PU-31, GBG-1, IPU-2-43, LBG-752 and LBG-787.   Sow from 15th June to 15th July. Seed rate 15-16 kg/ha for greengram and 18-20 kg/ha for blackgram. Spacing: 30 x 10 cm   Treat the seed with captan/thiram/carbendazim/mancozeb @ 2.5 g/ kg and imidacloprid 600 FS @ 5 ml or thiamethoxam 70 WS @ 5 g/kg 24-48 hours before sowing. Later treat the seed with Rhizobium culture @ 20 g/kg one hour before sowing.   Apply fertilizers for pulses @ 20 kg N and 50 kg P2O5 /ha as basal. Seed treatment with bio- fertilizers like rhizobium & PSB   Inter-cultivation twice at 20 and 30 DAS; irrigation twice at 30 and 50 DAS at critical growth stages i.e at flowering and pod development stages.   Under high moisture conditions due to unusual rains drain the excess water at the earliest and apply 4-5 kg N /ha. Spray KNO3 @ 1 % or 19:19:19 or 20:20:20 or 21:21:21 @ 1%. Spray 0.5% FeSO4 to correct Fe deficiency. Spray 1 % KNO3 to mitigate drought.   Beyond 2nd fortnight of July grow greengram and blackgram as intercrops with slightly higher seed rate in cotton (1:1) or pigeon pea (1:7). Small millets as preceding crops   Grow foxtail millet in kharif and chickpea in Rabi. Inter crop bajra with redgram in 2:1 ratio.   Crops like jowar, bajra, foxtail millet and pulses viz., greengram, balckgram, horsegram, cowpea, field bean can be grown as contingency corps after July if monsoon is delayed.   Grow short duration foxtail millet variety SIA 3222 (Garuda) as preceding crop in rainfed black soils.   Seed rate for bajra is 1.6 kg/acre and sowing time is June-July. Treat the seed with Carbendazim/ Mancozeb @ 3g/kg. Soak seed in 2% (20 g/liter) salt solution for 10 min to remove ergot infected seed.
