 • Agroforestry plays an important role in the sustainability of rainfed areas, since high risk is involved with arable farming due to aberrant weather situations and other abiotic and biotic stresses resulting in uneconomic yields. Agroforestry is increasingly viewed as a system that provides ecosystem services, environmental benefits and economic commodities as part of multifunctional working landscapes. Indian Farming 8 January 2025 Agroforestry Policy support for rainfed agriculture Policy supports plays a crucial role in enabling rainfed farmers to adopt sustainable and climate- resilient practices. Increased investment in agricultural research and development is essential for developing new technologies and practices that can benefit rainfed farmers. Institutions like the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and state agriculture universities are critical in driving research that focuses on improving rainfed crop varieties, soil health, and water management. Furthermore, subsidies and incentives for rainfed farmers can encourage the adoption of sustainable practices. The government’s Soil Health Card Scheme, which provides farmers with information on the nutrient status of their soil, is an example of a policy designed to improve soil management and fertility Crop intensification Access to credit and insurance is another area where policy support can significantly benefit rainfed farmers. Initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bhīma Yojana (PMFBY), which provides crop insurance against weather-related risks, can help farmers manage the financial risks associated with rainfed agriculture. Similarly, improving access to credit through institutions like NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development) allows farmers to invest in better seeds, irrigation systems, and other technologies that can improve their productivity. Market Diversification offers significant opportunities for rainfed farmers to increase their profitability. One promising avenue is the production of value-added products from rainfed crops. For example, the processing of millets, pulses, and oilseeds into flour, snacks, or health products can increase their market value and open up new income streams for farmers. In states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the promotion of millet-based products is gaining traction, driven by increasing consumer demand for nutritious, organic foods. Additionally, organic and sustainable agriculture practices, which are often inherent in rainfed farming, can attract premium prices in domestic and international markets. The growing trend toward organic farming, supported by schemes like the Paramparagat Kristi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), is creating new opportunities for rainfed farmers to tap into niche markets. Expanding access to export markets can provide rainfed farmers with new opportunities to sell their produce at better prices.
