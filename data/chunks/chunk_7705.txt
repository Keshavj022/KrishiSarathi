 Vegetable Root-stock in tomato: Inter-species grafting was successfully exploited in production of tomato on brinjal root-stock (IC-354557) with 6.13 kg/plant yield in cv. Kashi Aman and 5.6 kg/plant in cv. Kashi Chayan. Cultivating long melon in low tunnel in arid zones: The technology for cultivation of long melon under low tunnel with polythene covering for early and off-season production was standardized with sowing on 20th December. Enhancing fruit set in polyhouse grown cucurbits: Introduction of Indian honey bee (Apis cerana) through hives with two side openings helped in orienting honey bees towards cucurbit flowers in poly-house and assisted pollination resulted in 88.5% fruit set compared to zero fruit set in bagged flowers. Seed germination of moringa: The method of seed germination for shahjan (Moringa oleifera) var. Thar CROP MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019â€“20 70 Harsha was standardized. Seeds without wing kept in between paper (rolled towel method-BP) produced healthy and vigorous seedling with maximum germination (66%) as against seed with wing-BP (48%), seed with wing-TP (42%) or seed without wing-TP (22%) with poor seedling growth. Potato A site specific decision support system NRPPP (Nutrient Recommendation for Potato Production in Punjab) was developed as per the output derived from QUEFTS Model. A document on GAP for production of potato in India was developed for the benefit of different stakeholders. It includes control points and their compliances for GAP certification developed by Quality Council of India (QCI). Spices Drip fertigation in black pepper: Drip irrigation in black pepper (8 l water/day) in combination of 50% RDF (recommended dose of fertilizer as 19:19:19-NPK liquid mixture) in 3-equal splits at weekly interval during June, September and February gave highest benefit cost ratio (2.07) and ` 187,500/ha, which is equal to ` 150/vine/ year as compared to the conventional method of irrigation and basal application of fertilizers. Fertigation in cardamom: Highest gross (` 252,928) and net returns (` 177,928) were recorded with drip irrigation (9 l/clump/day) in combination of 100% RDF through drip with B:C ratio 3.37. Drip fertigation in coriander: The drip fertigation in coriander at 0.8 IW/CPE ratio recorded significantly higher plant height (112.17 cm), umbels/plant (28.22), umbellets/umbel (5.68), seeds/umbel (46.50), test weight (12.84 g), 45% increased seed yield (20.86 q/ha), net returns (` 135,946/ha) and B:C ratio (3.62) with 18.7% water saving as compared to conventional practice. Drip fertigation in fennel: A package of practices comprising drip irrigation (0.8 IW/CPE ratio) at 2 to 3 days interval coupled with fertigation (75% RDF through soluble fertilizers at 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 days after sowing) in fennel for light textured soils was standardized. It recorded significantly higher plant height, umbels/plant (29.22), seed yield (24.78 q/ha), net returns (` 163,176/ha) and B:C ratio (3.
