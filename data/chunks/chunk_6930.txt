Crop Residue Management: The north-western India especially, Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, commonly known as the seat of Green Revolution in India, immensely contributed to the national food security mainly through producing paddy and wheat. However, intensive cultivation practices in this part of the country have also led to burning of paddy straw due to short window (15-25 days) for timely sowing of ensuing rabi crops (mainly the wheat). The enormous burning, within a short span of 15 days, leads to atmospheric pollution, massive nutritional losses and deterioration of physical and biological health of the soil. Taking this problem into consideration the Government of India decided to launch a Central Sector Scheme on “Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for in-situ management of crop residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi” in 2018.
