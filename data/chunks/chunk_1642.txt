 Genetic fidelity of the transgenic chickpea lines derived from DCP92- Effect of potassium phosphite on major rice pathogens Effect of potassium phosphite on blast incidence in rice on non-transgenic rice Effect of potassium phosphite on germination of rice Potassium Phosphite (Dose) Potassium Phosphite (Dose) Transgenic rice expressing ptxD gene Transgenic rice expressing ptxD gene Wild type parent Wild type parent 0 mM 0 mM 50 mM 50 mM 400 mM 400 mM 200 mM 200 mM 100 mM 100 mM Glimpses of National Agricultural Science Fund (2006-2023) 30 3 was assessed using SSR markers having genome-wide coverage. Detached leaf bioassay was conducted in T1 lines derived from two chickpea events using third instar larvae. Based on molecular analyses and insect bioassay data, three promising events each in chickpea and pigeon pea were identified for event selection trial, and application submitted to RCGM, Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi. At AAU, Jorhat, more than 200 transgenic lines were generated in chickpea using different Bt- Cry gene constructs harbouring either a Cry1Ac or a Cry2Aa gene. Of these, 12 lines had high level of Bt toxin (>30 ng/mg FW) and in 9 of these 12 lines, transgene segregated at a ratio of 3:1. Lines with complete protection against Helicoverpa were obtained. At UAS, Dharwad, 202 primary transformants for cry1Ac and 216 primary transformants for cry2Aa in pigeon pea were generated. A total of 53 cryAc positive and 20 cry2Aa positive plants were selected, and the bioassay of all 53 transformants showed a maximum mortality of about 90.0%. In two events, the progenies showed 15:1 segregation. In the progenies maximum larval mortality observed was about 84.0%. Agrocin producing Agrobacterium radiobacter for biological control of crown gall in stone fruits: A native non-gall forming isolate of the bacterium Agrobacterium radiobacter, isolate UHFBA-218 (Cherry 2E-2-2) showed control of crown gall of peach by 92.14% compared to 74.19% by strain K-84 of the bacterium that is used world over as seed treatment on peach. The disease incidence in untreated plants was 84.92%. Epidemiology and forewarning system of downey mildew disease of cucurbits to develop appropriate IPM strategy: A rule-based prediction model for predicting onset of downy mildew disease, the most important disease of cucurbits, was developed and validated combining average daily temperature and night leaf wetness duration. The model was validated on three cucurbit crops at the experimental station in 2010 and 2011 with 75% success. The model is now being tested in farmersâ€™ fields. Role of small signal peptides in systemic defense response of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) to aphids (Lipaphis erysimi): The genes like BjEli1 and BjEli2 which trigger the defence system of mustard plants to aphids were identified, cloned and validated.
