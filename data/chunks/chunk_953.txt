 Swarna Samriddhi Dhan has also shown moderate resistance against major insect-pests like stem borer (dead heart and white ears head), leaf folder, gall midge (biotype 1) and whorl maggot in natural conditions but need based application of insecticides is recommended to manage insects. For plant protection of Swarna Samriddhi Dhan, prophylactic sprays of one dose of any systemic insecticide need to be done as and when needed. Economic benefit In irrigated areas, farmers used to harvest 4.0–4.5 t/ha rice from medium duration rice variety. While adopting this rice variety (Swarna Samriddhi Dhan) farmers having a yield advantage of 1 to 1.5 t/ha over their local cultivated cultivars. In addition, under drought and submergence condition, this variety also have yield gain of 1 to 1.5 t/ha over local cultivated variety. Therefore, farmers used to get a net benefit of `18000 to 25000/ha. In this regard, this variety is having much importance and potential in improving livelihood of farm families in the region, where frequent drought and flood is common phenomenon. SUMMARY Under changing climate situations low rice productivity in irrigated and rainfed lowland ecosystems is threatening food security. The released and notified multiple stress tolerant rice variety Swarna Samriddhi Dhan shows significant yield superiority over the national, Zonal and local check varieties in eastern region, particularly in Bihar. It has also shown desirable grain and cooking quality traits. Swarna Samriddhi Dhan is suitable for cultivation in favourable irrigated, water limiting irrigated and drought-prone rainfed areas. This variety shows moderately resistance to most of the major diseases and insect pests. Adoption of high-yielding, multiple stresses (drought, submergence, disease and insect pest) tolerant, good grain and cooking quality, input-responsive rice variety Swarna Samriddhi Dhan will play significant role in increasing rice productivity and food security among the farm families in the irrigated as well as rainfed shallow lowland areas in Bihar as well as other eastern states. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: rakeshbhu08gmail.com Table 1.
