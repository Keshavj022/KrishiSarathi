Deshpande et al. Science of the Total Environment 904 (2023) 166944 12 studies, we find that our estimates are, on average, 80 % lower than those reported in previous studies (Table S6). This is likely because we used ABA in our estimate of emissions from CRB, whereas most previous studies estimated emissions based on using a 0.25 fraction of the total residue produced. As discussed earlier, estimating emissions using the faction of residue produced as opposed to ABA likely overestimates emissions as not all farmers burn residues (Fig. S3). Venkataraman et al. (2006) adopted a similar remote sensing-based approach to estimate emissions, using the MODIS-based active fire product and land cover maps to estimate emissions from CRB for 1995–2000. However, the study was limited because it only used the active fire data to identify which crop types were burned rather than directly quantifying ABA and associated emissions. There are several other distinctions between our study and previous studies. Most previous studies have estimated emissions at a limited spatial (e.g., state) or temporal (e.g., one year) scale, which may lead to a difference in estimates across the full study period (Jain et al., 2014; Ravindra et al., 2019; Reddy et al., 2002; Sahai et al., 2011; Sahu et al., 2021; Venkataraman et al., 2006). Another major distinction between our study and previous ones is the choice of crops. While previous studies selected up to thirteen additional crops from oilseeds, coarse cereals, and pulses, we selected only seven crops for estimating emissions, which were selected based on a survey of the literature and ground surveys. The number of crops selected for emission estimation can significantly affect the calculation of emission estimates, particularly when it is assumed that a high fraction of a specific crop's residue is burned. The comparison with five existing global inventories which use MODIS fire products (FEER, FINN v1.5, GFAS, QFED) and MODIS and VIIRS products (FINN v2.5) and our fire emission product show dis­ crepancies in magnitudes and trends. These disagreements can be associated with differences in the methodology used to detect and quantify burning (Fire Radiative Power vs Burned Area), satellite detection limits (MODIS vs MODIS and VIIRS), vegetation classification, components used to estimate burned matter and emission factors.
