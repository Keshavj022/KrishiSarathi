 Diluted (D) poultry excreta without any other combinations acted as control (T0). The hydraulic retention time (HRT), bio-gas production, blue flame proportion etc., was significantly better in DCA followed by DC and was lowest in D. The ratio of bio-gas production in D:DC:DCA was 1:2:4. The content of methane (%, V/V), carbon-dioxide (%, V/ V), oxygen (%, V/V), hydrogen sulphide (ppmv) and balance gases in DC was 58.3, 33.23, 1.33, 22.33 and 7.03, respectively. The respective values in DCA were 55.47, 35.5, 0.83, 57.00 and 8.17. It was concluded that conditioning of poultry excreta has better potential for all-weather bio-gas production. LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016â€“17 75 days of insemination. The animals treated with Ovsynch protocol showed a higher rate of synchronisation (83.33 vs. 66.66%). However, there was no significant difference in pregnancy rate between Ovsynch and PRID protocol. Poultry Housing systems: The behavioural inventory of young layers of White Leghorn (CARI-Priya) and their welfare status under different housing conditions were studied during winter. At 18th week of age, 450 layer birds from a single hatch were randomly assigned into three treatment groups, viz. floor housing, colony cage and individual cage. Results revealed that, during winter, the floor reared layers spent significantly more time in sitting (46.4%), walking (7.2%) and investigating behaviour (4.0%) than those reared on colony (38.2, 4.8 and 1.4%) or individual cage (30.9, 1.4 and 1.0%). Individual cage layers spent more time in feeding (40.7%) than the colony (26.6%) or floor birds (22.9%). However, time spent for drinking and preening activity was similar in all housing systems. In the colony cages, feather pecking was more frequent, while in cage layers pecking appeared stereotyped in many hens, but at a low frequency. There were significant differences in the welfare status regarding feather conditions, claw length, gait scores and tonic immobility of the birds between the management conditions, while no significant difference was found in keel bone condition and foot lesions. Significantly higher fearful response and time for first peck (response to novel object test) was observed in individual cage layers than the floor and colony birds. Evaluation of semen diluents and its use in improving fertility in chicken: Semen diluents namely, BPSE (Beltsville poultry semen extender) and TES (N-Tris hydroxymethyl-methyl-2-amino ethane sulphonic acid)-NaCl were evaluated for determination of a good semen diluent for dilution of chicken semen. Based on semen parameters, BPSE semen diluent showed better results as compared to TES. The fertility rate was 72.4% in BPSE group and 65.1% in TES-NaCl group at 0 hr storage of semen. The hatchability was 60.23% in BPSE group and 56.08% in TES-NaCl group. Vitamin C (10 mg) supplemented with BPSE showed better results in terms of per cent motility (59.
