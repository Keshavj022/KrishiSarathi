 These crops mature faster, avoiding late-season stresses that can significantly reduce yields. Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), has identified climate-resilient crop varieties. These stress-tolerant crops are being tested and adopted in various vulnerable regions across the country. Some of the crops and their resistant varieties suitable for abiotic stresses are given in Table 1. Similarly, there are varieties that are specifically bred for biotic stress tolerance. Demonstration of climate-resilient varieties has been done across the country for horizontal diffusion of technology in a participatory technology development (PTD) mode with farmers. Some of the promising crop cultivars that can tolerate various biotic stresses in various rainfed crops recommended for Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and other states are given in Table 2.

Different crops have varying root structures and nutrient needs, which can enhance soil structure, improve organic matter content, and promote microbial diversity. These diverse crops also have the ability to be more resilient to abiotic stresses. Crops with different rooting system (deep and shallow roots) can ensure the survival of some crops by better utilization of moisture.
