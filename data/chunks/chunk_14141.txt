 We also provide a strategic framework that, by integrating the synergies between these three key sectors, provides a mechanism and a long-term roadmap for a sustainable future for India. Energy sector Globally, the energy sector is the leading contributor to GHG emissions, accounting for 75.6% of total emissions4. India mirrors this trend, with 83% of its GHG emissions coming from this sector alone5. The nation’s rapid economic growth has spurred heightened energy demand, primarily met by fossil fuels, especially coal. India’s power demand has con- sistently grown at a 7.2% CAGR from 20092010 to 20222023, primarily dominated by coal, constituting 49.1% of total installed capacity6. In 20212022, coal-based power plants contributed 72.92% of total power generated, and other non-renewable sources added another 18.84% and only 8.24% of the total energy mix came from renewable energy sources (RES). The disparity in installed capacity vs. output in renewables arises from factors like renewable energy (RE) intermittency, grid integration challenges, and lower efﬁciency in harvesting RE. The primary challenge is the signiﬁcantly lower capacity utilisation factor (CUF) of RE, with solar and wind averaging 19% and 28%, respectively, compared to coal’s CUF of around 68% as of 20237. This means replacing a coal plant’s energy output with renew- ables requires 24 times the capacity. Figure 1 shows the GHG emission contribution by differ- ent sources from the Indian energy sector in 20198. This highlights India’s heavy reliance on non-renewable energy, which not only emits GHGs but also contributes to severe air and water pollution that, in turn, impacts public health (Greenstone & Hanna, 2014). Although GOI has promoted RE and energy efﬁciency, transitioning to cleaner energy remains challenging. Over the past decade, policymakers have focused on two strategies: reducing electricity con- sumption through energy-efﬁciency measures and shifting towards renewables. These efforts aim to promote sustain- able energy practices and reduce GHG emissions to safe- guard both the environment and public health. Current policies in the energy sector Energy policy is crucial for a nation’s energy independence and economic competitiveness (Bazilian, Sovacool, & Miller, 3 Based on installed and under-construction projects (as of 31 March 2023) data from Central Electricity Authority. 4 https://www.wri.org/insights/4-charts-explain-greenhouse-gas- emissions-countries-and-sectors  Accessed on 07 August 2023. 5 https://www.ghgplatform-india.org/energy-sector  Accessed on 07 August 2023. 6 https://powermin.gov.in/en/content/power-sector-glance-all- india  Accessed on 08 August 2023. 7 https://iced.niti.gov.in/energy/electricity/generation/power- generation  Accessed on 12 July 2023. 8 Source: https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/co2- emissions-from-the-indian-energy-sector-2019  Accessed on 15 July 2023. 22 H.
