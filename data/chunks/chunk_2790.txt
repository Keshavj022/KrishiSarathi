 2001-2004: Dr Khadi, Dr Katageri, Dr Udikeri and Dr Vamadevaiah used ELISA and bioassays to identify homozygous lines and advanced the BN Bt to T3 generation at UAS Dharwad. 5. The work was published in Current Science (I. S. Katageri, H. M. Vamadevaiah, S. S. Udikeri, B. M. Khadi and Polumetla A. Kumar. 2007. Genetic transfonnation of an elite Indian genotype of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) for insect resistance. Current Science, 93, 1843-1847). 6. 2005: Dr Khadi joined as Director CICR in May 2005 and brought a few T4 'BN Be seeds with him. 7. 2005: The seeds were given to Dr Suman Bala Singh, Plant Breeder, CICR, and grown in a polyhouse at CICR, Nagpur and biosafety studies were initiated through CICR under the leadership of Dr Khadi. 8. 2005: Subsequently, in August 2005, Dr Khadi sent twenty leaf samples from twenty plants to Dr Kranthi, Bt referral laboratory CICR requesting ELISA and PCR tests. 9. ELISA Â·results showed that sixteen leaf samples were positive for Cry1Ac. The PCR results for cry1Ac showed that the samples contained a full length gene of 3534 bp which indicated the probability of 'Mon531' event. 10. The samples were subjected to Mon531 5' junction and Mon531 3' junction specific primers to amplify 499bp and 274bp amplicons. The samples confirmed to contain cry1 Ac from Mon531. 11. The samples were SUbjected to PCR using a three primer set (derived from inverse PCR) that detects 'Mon531' event of Monsanto. All sixteen samples were found to be positive for 'Mon531 '. Six samples were homozygous and ten were hemizygous for the 'Mon531'. The results were communicated to Dr B. M. Khadi. 12. The plants in nethouse were tested with Bt-Express strips and 37 leaf samples were subjected to the Mon three primer test. Nine plants were homozygous. 13.2005: Dr Khadi expressed that the presence of 'Mon531' in the putative 'BN Bt' T5 generation plants could have been due to contamination and care would be taken to remove the same from the original event. He informed that he communicated the results and concerns to Dr Katageri and Dr Ananda Kumar and that appropriate steps would be taken up. - - - - - - - - - - - ... 14. 2005-2008: Contained Open Field Trial, Multi Location Research trials and Biosafety studies were carried out by Dr Khadi, Director CICR and applications to RCGM and GEAC were submitted through CICR. 15. The BN Bt variety and 'Bt NHH 44' was tested under RCGM "Contained Open Field Trial" at three locations in three collon growing zones during 2005-2006 and Multi- Location Research Trials (MLRT) in 12 locations in all the three zones in 2006-07 and 2007-08. The BN Bt and Bt NHH 44 showed over-all yield superiority in both seed collon and lint yield when compared with Non-Bt check and local checks. 16. 2006-2008: Biosafety studies were carried out at various institutions through CICR. 17.2006-07: The Dharwad event was characterized by Dr Khadi and Dr Ananda Kumar through outsourcing the work to MIS Awasthagen, Bangalore.
