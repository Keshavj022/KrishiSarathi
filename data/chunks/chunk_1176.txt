The brooding and management of ducklings during early period of up to 4 weeks would reduce the mortality. The ducklings were sold only after brooding period to reduce mortality. If the hatchable eggs were timely available and the duckling could be marketed in time, then at least 8 batches of such duckling production and brooding of eggs could be done. Analysis of hatching and brooding per batches of 1000 ducklings is given in Table 1. The labour cost was nil as family labour was utilised in the enterprise. Therefore, it can be said that the enterprise may give an annual income of ` 1.62 lakh with a monthly income of more than ` 13500. SUMMARY Entrepreneurship development through duckling production with low-cost incubator is a promising enterprise that can be a good source of income for the unemployed rural youth. Economic analysis has shown that the enterprise has the potential to provide year-round employment to the rural youth with good remuneration if proper care and management during incubation and brooding of ducklings is done. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: rakeshvetext@yahoo.co.in Rural youth engaged in brooding and management Access Digital Copies of Indian Farming at http://epubs.icar.org.in/ejournal Indian Farming January 2022 31 Organic Farming: Organic Farming: An approach for sustainable agriculture S P Singh* and Chanchala Rani Patel Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Raigarh 496 001 Chhattisgarh Indira Gandhi Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Raipur, Chhattisgarh Organic farming is a sustainable agriculture production system being followed since ancient times in India. The natural resource management and biodiversity conservation are core principles of organic agriculture. During post independence era, the most important challenge was to produce enough food grain for the growing population. Hence, high-yielding production system with chemical fertilizers and agrochemicals was adopted. The system has concerns related to soil health, agrosphere, environmental pollution, sustainability and productivity. Organic farming is a system of farming that involves growing and nurturing crops without the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Also, no genetically modified organisms are permitted. The primary aim of organic farming is to keep the soil in good health through the use of biological materials along with beneficial microbes to release macro and micronutrients to crops for increased sustainable production in an ecofriendly, pollution free environment.
