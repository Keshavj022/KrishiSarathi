 Some of the salient findings of the ongoing subprojects under CGP are: ● PA gene was PCR amplified using suitable primers out from pXO1 plasmid- A 184 Kb plasmid that carries the genes for three components of anthrax toxin, viz. PA, LF and EF, by using appropriate primers. Suitable restriction sites were generated on both ends of PA gene to facilitate cloning. The primers used were Forward Primer: 5’ GGC GCG GTA CCG AAG TTA AAC AGG AGA AC 3’; and Reverse Primer: 5’ ATT TAA AAG GAT CCT AGA ATT ACC TTA TCC 3’. ● Transgenic tobacco plants carrying PA gene were developed. Tobacco leaf explants were infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying a vector in which PA gene was cloned under the control of CAMv 35 S promoter. After co-cultivation, tobacco explants were regenerated/selected on MS medium containing benzyladenine, naphatheline acetic acid (NAA), Kanaycin and cefotaxime. ● The cDNA libraries were made using RNA isolated from heat shocked (42°C, 2 hr shoot) as well as control (un-induced shoot) tissues of Pusa 169 rice cultivar. RNA from the control and stressed seedling was isolated by modified method of Logemann. The modification was the omission of the LiC1 as RNA precipitating agent, as LiC1 is a known inhibitor of reverse transcripitase. After checking the quality of RNA on a MOPOS-formaldehyde gel 1.2 mg of total RNA was used for isolation of mRNA using biotin-dt and streptavidin paramagenetic.

The NAARM has prepared revised guidelines for SREP preparation. NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY PROJECT 201 ● Seven institutes of the ICAR were reviewed for the institutional efficiency through a consultancy firm. The final report is being refined with a view to bring O&M reforms in the ICAR. ● Guidelines for prioritization of research proposals for Competitive Grant Programme prepared and widely distributed. ● Project Information Management System (PIMS) was finalized for monitoring and concurrent evaluation. Off line PIMs (stand alone version) was implemented at all the pilot sides. The reports can be generated from data that have been entered at pilot sides.
