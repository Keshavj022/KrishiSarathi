 They earned a sum of ` 3,20,000/year with a net return of ` 1,96,400/year and individually they earned a share of ` 19,640/year. They have partly invested this for maintaining kitchen garden, cultivation of cereal crops such as paddy, green gram and black gram. Before being adopted by ICAR-CIFA, they were hardly able to earn a sum of ` 10,000/year. Scientific aquaculture has opened a new avenue of income for the SHGs and it is envisaged that this will contribute to enhance socio- economic status. This has enabled them to share with other farmers regarding their successful enterprise. Partnership and institution building Under this project, Self Help Group for schedule caste and landless women were mobilized for poultry farming. Trainings on technologies related to one- day-old chick brooding, poultry feed vaccinations and mushroom cultivation were provided to the beneficiaries. Important support structures, such as Aqua Chaupal and a One-Stop Aqua Shop were also been established. Aqua Chaupal, located in Sarakana village, serves as a hub for fish farmers to gather, discuss, and address aquaculture-related issues. This space not only facilitates knowledge sharing but also builds a sense of community among local farmers. The One-Stop Aqua Shop in Naroda, Balipatna, provides farmers with essential resources, including fish fingerlings, feed, and medicines. Additionally, it supports local fish selling activities, helping to streamline the supply chain and enhance market access for farmers. Content mobilization Website developed for the project: Complete information including location, beneficiaries, villages adopted, intervention, photo gallery, publications, contact, etc., are on the website. Further, link of the Institute’s publications is provided for better access. Details of available technologies of the Institute are present on the given website (www.cifa.nic.in). An Odia booklet has been developed highlighting the success of different interventions and is being distributed to farmers and other stakeholders.
