 m) recorded the highest net income of . 2,64,854 and . 2,47,389 per ha per year. Both the models generated an employment of 360 man-days per year. In Tripura, two Farming Systems, viz. Integrated Seed based Farming System (ISFS-0.85 ha) and Integrated Intensive Farming System (IIFS-0.70 ha) were established. Apart from crop production and dairy unit, both the systems included fodder grasses on the terrace risers and fences, compost pits, ponds for fish farming and life saving irrigation, plantation crops like arecanut, mango, banana, litchi, papaya, coconuts, etc. The total energy input and output in ISFS were 2,49,416.2 MJ and 15,40,304.5 MJ, respectively. The energy input and output for IIFS were 1,34,257.57 MJ and 4,51,878.73 MJ, thus energy-use efficiency for ISFS and IIFS was 6.1 and 3.3, respectively. The net return received was R 2,49,634 and R 1,49,257 and B:C ratio was 5.9 and 3.9 under ISFS and IIFS, respectively. Employment generated for ISFS and IIFS was 345 and 325 days, respectively. The rice- equivalent yield (REY) for the whole ISFS was 16.33 tonnes/ha and for IIFS it was 10.86 t/ha. Integrated Organic Farming System for income and employment enhancement: Integrated Organic Farming System (IOFS) models were established at Tripura and Meghalaya. The Tripura model gave a net return of about 73,990. and employment of 67 days which is quite high compared to existing farming systems. About 70% of the nutrient requirement of the model was met from nutrient recycling within the model. The Meghalaya model recorded a total net return of 83,360 per year which is much higher than the region’s farmer common practices of rice monocropping or improved practice of the rice-vegetables cropping system. Approximately 96% of the total N requirement, 87% of the total P2O5 requirement and 99% of the total K2O requirement could be met within this model thus making it a self-sustainable one. Ten high yielding stress tolerant crop varieties released: Two drought tolerant rice varieties, namely ICAR-NEH NICRA Hill Rice 2022-2 for cultivation in the Upland Hills of Himachal Pradesh and Manipur while ICAR NEH NICRA-Boro Dhan 1 for Boro cultivation in Tripura, Assam and West Bengal, developed by ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Tripura Centre, were released and notified by VIC-CVRC for central release. ICAR-NEH NICRA Hill Rice 2022-2 has a yield advantage of 19.87%, 27.07% and 23.03%, compared to National Control (NC), Regional Control (RC) and Local Control (LC), respectively. ICAR NEH NICRA- Boro Dhan 1’s yield advantage is 20.8 to 50.98%. Besides, one guava variety Megha Magenta, developed by ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, was recommended for release by VIC-CVRC. Fruits are sweet in taste, high TSS (9.9–10.4%), low acid (0.50–0. 0.63%) with fairly good in ascorbic acid content (181.14–205.64 mg/100 g). The attractive red pulp colour makes it very suitable for processing.
