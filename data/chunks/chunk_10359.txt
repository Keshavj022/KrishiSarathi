 Many insects that invaded India got established as regular pests include cassava mealybug (2020), fall armyworm (2018), South American tomato moth (2014), papaya mealy bug (2007), cotton mealybug (2005), eucalyptus gall wasp (2000), silver leaf whitefly or ‘B’ biotype of Bemisia. tabaci (1999), coconut eriopyhid mite (1998), spiralling whitefly (1993), coffee berry borer (1990) and psyllid vector of citrus greening disease during 1960s. Besides, many exotic pests that entered the country during earlier decades are causing significant damage to various crops. Desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria Forskål) caused significant loss to crops in North West and Central India between April to June 2019. India witnessed an upsurge of the locust in 2020 also with the swarms attaining epidemic proportions alongside of COVID- 19 pandemic. Several efforts have been made to contain invasive species through biological control. Under classical biological control, examples of pest suppression with imported natural enemies include predator, Rodolia cardinalis against cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchase (1951); predator, Curinus coeruleus against subabul psyllid, Heteropsylla cubana (1990); parasitoids, Prorops nasuta & Cephalonomia stephanoderis against coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei using (1990); parasitoid, Encarsia Guadeloupe against spiralling white fly, Aleurodicus Achievements in Crop Protection in Independent India 215 disperses (1995); predators, Amblyseius largoensis & Neoseiulus mumai against coconut eriophid mite, Aceria gurreronis (1998); predator Tetraphleps raoi against, pine woolly aphid, Pineus pini (2007); parasiotoid, Aenasius arizonensis against cotton mealy bug, Phenococcus solenopsis (2007); parasitoid, Acerophagous papayae against papaya mealy bug, Paracoccus marginatus (2010); parasitoid, Quadrastichus mendeli against eucalyptus gall wasp, Leptocybe invasa (2018); parasitoid, Encarsia guadeloupae against coconut rugose spiraling whitefly, Aleurodicus rugioperculatus (2019). The latest introduction has been the parasitoid Anagyrus lopezi from Benin for the control of cassava mealy bug in Tamil Nadu and Kerala during 2021 (Sampathkumar et al. 2021). 3.3. Development of surveillance and forewarning techniques 3.3.1. Pest surveillance Regular real-time monitoring of crop pest enables assessment of risks and in turn adopt timely need-based measures for their effective management. Information and communication technology (ICT) is very effective in assimilation of data on pests over time and space, and its quick processing to facilitate a decision on pest management. The ongoing programmes viz., crop pest surveillance and advisory project (CROPSAP) and horticulture pest surveillance and advisory project (HortSAP) in Maharashtra (Vennila et al.
