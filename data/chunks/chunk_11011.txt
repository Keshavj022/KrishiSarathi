 • Paddy straw holding capacity of the unit per batch of operation is 1.6 tonnes • Quantity of animal dung required per batch of operation is 0.4 tonnes • Each batch will produce biogas for a period of 3 months and in an year 3 such batches can be loaded and biogas can be produced for 9 months in a year. • Biogas produced per day is 3 m3/day or equivalent to 1.30 kg per day of LPG (at a specific density of 0.43 kg per m3) • Cost of 1 kg of LPG is ` 56.34 (considering the commercial selling price of 1 cylinder of 14.2 kg of LPG is around ` 800). Fig. 1. Costs and returns as a function of Percentage of initial cost invested by the farmer 15 Biogas Production from Paddy Straw at Domestic/Community Level An analysis was done to determine the breakeven point for the farmer assuming various rates of subsidies on the initial cost of the PAU Model – II biogas plant. The following chart shows the rate of return and costs per year at various rates of subsidies: Table 3.

Net Loss to the farmer when he invests -16,075.00 100% of initial cost When the rate of subsidy is about 57% of the initial cost, the farmer will achieve the breakeven point for his investment in PAU Model – II Plant (meaning that the farmer need not spend any money for installing and running the plant). In addition he gets the fuel for domestic cooking at free of cost. Following are the additional advantages of installing on-farm biogas plants in each farm holdings: • Farmer gets the slurry as a fertilizer for his land • Demand for non-renewable LPG is reduced • Environmentally safe method of disposal of the straw 16 Ex-situ Crop Residue Management Options Table 4.
