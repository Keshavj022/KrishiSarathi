   Transplanting should be done during the period of 21 to 30 days after sown on seed bed otherwise, late transplanting will reduce the number of tillers and may result in untimely crop yield.   Along the hilly regions, Niger (cultivar GN-2 and GN-3 early maturity) as a drought resistant oilseed crop with highest nutritional superiority under very less crop management practices cab be cultivated. Greengram & Blackgram:   Under present weather condition, it is likely to observe infestation of heliothis and whiteflies in summer sown green gram & black gram.   To control heliothis spray Spinosad 3 ml/10lit of water for whiteflies spray Acetamiprid 20 % SP@ 5.0 gm and 500 ml of 5 % neem seed extract or neem seed oil 50 ml / 10 lit of water are recommended.

Drumstick:   Monitor the crop for infestation of Bud worm & leaf caterpillar.   If infestation is found, spray 500 ml of 5 % neem seed extract (Azadirachtin) or neem seed oil (Azadirachtin 1500 ppm) 50 ml/10 lit of water. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 129   Use light trap 1-2/ha to attract and kill the adults. Under heavy infestation make spray of Malathion 50 EC 20 ml/10 litre of water. Sugarcane:   Follow top dressing of fertilizer dose as per recommendations.   Critical irrigations should be provided based on the stage of the crop and soil condition.   Weeding and inter culturing should be done when needed. Earthing up should be done after 5-6 month of planting. Collect & destroy the egg mass of borers. Vegetables:   Monitor the crops for infestation of white fly in brinjal, okra, ridge, sponge, bottle and bitter gourd, cluster bean and water melon, if required spray 500 ml of 5 % neem seed extract or neem seed oil 50 ml with diafenthiuron 50 % WP @ 16 gm /10 lit of water. Tomato / Brinjal:   In brinjal and tomato constant monitoring of borers by using pheromone traps 4-6 per acre is advised, If insect population is above ETL than spraying of Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 % SC 3.0 ml or DDVP 7 ml/10 litre of water is advised against fruit borer.   If infestation of mites is found, spray Propargite 57 % EC @ 10 ml/ 10 litre of water for the control of mites under clear sky. Chilli:   Under present weather conditions, severe attack of thrips has been reported.   Spray profenofos 20 ml with 500 ml of 5 % neem seed extract or neem seed oil 50 ml in 10 litres of water. In case of heavy attack make spray of spinosad or spinetoram 3 ml per 10 liter of water. Banana:   During flowering/fruiting stage, carry out de-navelling (removal of male inflorescences for nutrient diversion) practices for better growth of banana fruits. Apply irrigation at fruit development stage.
