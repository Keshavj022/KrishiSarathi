 The experiment was conducted in rainy season (kharif) 2002–2003, when due to late monsoon the sowing and subsequent transplanting were delayed. Sowing in nursery was done between Table 1.

PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT 24 and 30 July and transplanting from 26 to 30 August. Observations were made on fortnightly basis i.e. on 30, 45 and 60 days after transplanting. Application of sandhna water and chlorpyriphos was done on September 17, 2002. The results obtained are presented in Table 2. Data presented in Table 2 show that in control plot the percentage of banki affected leaves was 80.5 at 30 DAT which remained more or less same (78%) at 60 DAT. In sandhna water application, the infestation was 76.9% at 30 DAT and 27.2% at 60 DAT. Chlorpyriphos application reduced the infestation from 75.4% at 30 DAT to 21.2% at 60 Table 3.

Further, the number of caseworm larvae was counted by counting the number of cases per square meter. The results obtained are presented in Table 3. Data presented in Table 3 show that the use of sandhna was effective in reducing the number of larvae of case-worm, which is similar to use of chlorpyriplus in effectiveness. CONCLUSION It may be concluded that the ITK is effective to a substantial extent in controlling caseworm in rice.
