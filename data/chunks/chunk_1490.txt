 By integrating multiple crop species, intercropping reduces pest infestations through various ecological mechanisms such as physical protection from wind, shading, and the disruption of pest dispersal. The diverse plant composition can camouflage target crops from pests. For example, sorghum + pigeonpea intercropping system reported 15-18% lesser pest incidence than sole sorghum crop. Additionally, intercropping encourages a higher abundance of natural enemies, such as predators and parasites that help control pest populations. The sorghum + pigeonpea intercropping system is regarded as successful in rainfed regions of Telangana due to the complementary nature of the two crops, which helps manage both biotic and abiotic stresses. Sorghum, being tall and drought-resistant, provides shade and physical support, while pigeonpea, a deep-rooted legume, fixes atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. The varied growth patterns reduce competition for resources, as pigeonpea accesses deeper soil layers for water and nutrients, while sorghum utilizes surface resources. This system helps control pests and diseases by disrupting their life cycles and enhances water-use efficiency, making it highly resilient in drought-prone or resource-limited environments. Indian Farming 25 January 2025 Cover crops Cover crops are the crops that aid to suppress weeds, improve soil health, increase water availability, reduce erosion, aid in the control of pests and diseases, and boost biodiversity. They can be beneficial for abiotic stress management in different ways. Cover crops improve soil health by enhancing water infiltration and retention, a key factor in rainfed systems where water availability is unpredictable. Their root systems, particularly those of grasses and legumes, promote soil structure stability and aggregate formation, improving moisture retention. Additionally, leguminous trap crops contribute to nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with essential nutrients that support plant growth during dry spells or nutrient-poor conditions. The microbial activity stimulated by trap crop root exudates further enhances nutrient cycling, making the system more resilient to drought and dry spells, which are common in rainfed agriculture. They also act as a natural defense mechanism by attracting pests away from the main crops, thus reducing insect infestations and lowering the need for chemical pest control. This biotic stress management is crucial in rainfed regions where pest outbreaks can severely impact yields. For example, in a study done with cowpea, sudan grass as a cover crop, cowpea not only suppressed weeds but also reduced the need for insecticides by providing a habitat for beneficial arthropods that naturally control pest populations. Weed suppression for subsequent crops may be another benefit.
