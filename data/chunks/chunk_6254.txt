Score sheet for weight bearing in standing position Fig. 9. Score sheet for weight bearing in standing position and weight bearing in motion Fig. 8 Score sheet of weight bearing in motion after application of ITK ointment and iodine ointment over the swelling of limb/joint (8 forelimb and 2 hind limb) were included in group III. Three cases had swelling on knee joint, 5 cases were of swelling over arm and the forearm, whereas two cases had swelling on lateral aspect of metatarsal region below the hock joint. Mostly the swellings were initiated due to trauma. In group IV, two animals had swelling on knee joint, six had swelling on posterior part of the metatarsal and two animals had swelling over knee joint. These animals exhibited the symptoms of lameness and limping of limb during progression. The score sheet evaluation of swellings revealed the mean score 3 on day 0 and 2.4±0.16, 2±0.23, 1.2±0.18 and 0.4, respectively after application of ITK ointment on days 7, 14, 21 and 30. There was regular linear decline trend of swelling over leg and joint. The mean score of swelling in iodine ointment group on day 0 was 2.7±0.15, which later declined in the swelling of shoulder and limb/joints (Tables 2 and 6). Pain-sensation score on day 0 was 2.9±0.1 which decreased gradually and declined during the course of observations on days 7, 14, 21 and 30, with the pain scores of 2.6±0.16, 2.1±0.23, 1.2±0.2, 1.2+0.19, respectively. The pain sensation in affected limb was 2.8±1.3 on day 0 in iodine ointment treated animals, which declined gradually (Tables 3 and 7). The score for swelling of shoulder/neck region and swelling over limb/joint on 0 day were 2.1+0.13, 3.0 and 2.2±0.11, 2.7+0.15 as against 0.5±0.20, 0.4, and 0.4 and 1.00, respectively on 30th day in ITK treatment and standard iodine ointment group. The overall observation revealed the decreasing trend of swelling on day 30 as compared to day 0 which suggested that the application of ITK and iodine ointment on swelling was found to be effective due to its antiinflammatory action (Table 8). The weight bearing of animals on day 0 indicated that they were not able to bear the body weight on the affected limb, and the weight bearing score was 1, 1.6±0.16, 1.9±0.17 and 2.5±0.22, respectively on days 7, 14, 21 and 30 in ITK group. The weight-bearing score was 1 Contents VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Table 5. Overall recovery of animals treated with the ITK at IVRI Table 6.
