 The rich cultural heritage, folklore, handicrafts, and ethnic diversity, as well as the rich and exotic flora and fauna, may be promoted as the attractive assets of the region. It also offers an opportunity for local communities to earn additional income, as the industry can accommodate skilled and unskilled people. Tourism can help to create employment, either as a primary or as a secondary source of income, check migration from the villages, revive the arts and crafts, traditional customs, and cultural identities, and promote greater social contact and exchange.   In view of the rapid technology turn over, appropriate strategy for capacity building of farmers in Arunachal Pradesh is required to maximize farm income through adoption of cutting-edge modern technology. The farmers usually stick to old practices and the younger generation distracts, which makes agriculture an occupation of elderly people living in rural areas. To attract enterprising youths to take up farming as profitable occupation and to reverse the out-migration, innovative strategy such as commercialization of agriculture and adoption of improved methods must be promoted. The action plan, therefore, should include:   Development of irrigation facilities and promotion of water-harvesting methods for assured water supply particularly in the Rabi season   Creation of Single Window input delivery system in the rural areas to ensure timely supply.   Surveillance of major pests and diseases and adoption of timely control measures   Programme for user-friendly information delivery system through on-farm trials, State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 38 demonstration, training, farmer-participatory interaction programme   Programme to promote the development of fruit crops (kiwi, orange, persimmon, apple, walnut, pears, and pomegranate) and vegetables (on and off-season like (cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, squash, beans, pumpkin, chilies and brinjal).   Creating sufficient storage facilities particularly cold storage for perishable commodities and food processing units.   Financial support for creation of agricultural infrastructure such as strengthening irrigation facilities, farm machineries, processing and storage facilities, rural roads and communication.   Marketing infrastructure to be created at the primary markets in rural areas and regulated markets in district level to reduce distress sale by the farmers. Potential contribution to farmers’ income and strategy for scaling out these technologies: ICAR Institutes in North Eastern region have developed good number of technologies for augmenting production and value addition, validated and demonstrated in the region along with estimation of net income of the participating farmers. Adoption of these zone specific technologies and their expansion in horizontal manner can be instrumental in achieving the target of doubling farmers’ income in the region.
