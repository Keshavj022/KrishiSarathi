Copy of Allotment of IC Number from the NBPGR (Annexure-IV) 245  • MPMH 17 is a dual-purpose hybrid of pearl millet with high grain and stover yield. • The hybrid MPMH 17 is a cross between a male-sterile line ICMA 04999 (female parent) and a restorer MIR 525-2 (male parent). The line ICMA 04999 is based on A1 source of cytoplasmic male-sterility. • Tested in the All- India Coordinated Pearl Millet Improvement Project trials during 2009-2011 at 57 locations (18 locations each in 2009 and 2011; and 21 locations in 2010) along with four checks — Pusa 23, ICMH 356, GHB 744 and RHB 121. • Consistent performance of MPMH 17 during three years of evaluation: hybrid ranked first among all test entries including checks in 2009 and 2011 and ranked 2nd in 2010. • On an average, it yielded 2,835 kg grain /ha, which was 10-40% higher than yield of four checks — Pusa 23 (2,028 kg/ha), ICMH 356 (2,371 kg/ha), GHB 744 (2,543 kg/ha) and RHB 121 (2,576 kg/ha). • MPMH 17 also yielded higher stover (64 q/ha) than Pusa 23 (52 q/ha), ICMH 356 (56 q/ha) and GHB 744 (63 q/ha), though its stover yield was slightly (1.5%) lesser than RHB 121 (65 q/ha). • The maturity duration of MPMH 17 and four checks was almost at a par (77-79 days). In spite of the same crop duration, considerable superiority of MPMH 17 to checks highlights that growth rate and per day productivity of this hybrid is higher than checks. • Another distinctive advantage of MPMH 17 is its high level of resistance to downy mildew and blast, two most important diseases of pearl millet. Under artificially created epiphytotic conditions at 19 hot-spots during 2009-2011, MPMH 17 showed only 1.2% downy mildew incidence as compared to 2-6% downy mildew incidence on checks. • Blast incidence in this hybrid was 9% in comparison to 10-15% of four checks. • MPMH 17 responded favourably to additional doses of nitrogen. The yield improvement at 60 kg N/ha and 90 kg N/ha 802 was 12% and 20%, respectively, over the basal dose of 30 kg N/ha during testing in the AICPMIP trials. • The hybrid MPMH 17 matures, on an average in 79 days, and flowers in 48 days. It is high tillering (2.7 panicles/plant) and produces very compact panicles of 22-24 cm length, filled with medium -sized grains (seed weight of 8.0 g/1,000 grains) of globular shape and grey-brown colour. The hybrid attains approximate height of 180 cm and produces panicles that are, on an average, 2.6 -cm thick. • Considering its grain and stover yield and disease resistance, MPMH 17 is proposed for identification for rainfed conditions of kharif in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.
