 Although vegetable farming offers advantages over traditional cereal crops, such as higher yields, shorter growth cycles and more job opportunities, it also exposes crops to climate change risks like heat waves, droughts and floods. To ensure the future of vegetable production, it is crucial to prioritize research on the effects of climate change and find solutions to mitigate its impact on vegetable growth, yield, and quality. Issues from climate change regarding sustainable vegetable crop production Addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach that includes developing climate-resilient crop varieties, Indian Farming 26 September 2023 implementing sustainable farming practices, improving irrigation and water management systems and adopting integrated pest and disease management strategies. By focusing attention on understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change on vegetable production, we can work towards ensuring food security and sustainable agricultural practices in the face of a changing climate. Various aspects affected by climate change Temperature: Temperature significantly impacts vegetable plant growth, affecting yield, flowering, fruit quality and development stages. High temperatures lead to negative effects like bud loss, abnormal flowers, reduced pollen and seed viability and limited carbohydrates. These heat-induced reproductive issues result in small, low-quality fruits and poor fruit sets, as observed in studies on cauliflower curd initiation. Temperatures exceeding 30°C in tomato cultivation cause a rise in the loss of flowers and fruits. In contrast, elevated temperatures following the release of pollen reduce the formation of fruits and the overall yield. Onion bulbs also suffer from reduced size when exposed to temperatures exceeding 40°C. In bean crops, high temperatures cause a delay in flowering due to the promotion of a short-day photoperiod. Similarly, in okra, crop temperatures above 42°C lead to a drop in flowering and a subsequent loss in yield. On the other hand, low temperatures during extreme winter conditions can also significantly impact vegetable crop production. Crops such as potatoes, brinjals (eggplants) and tomatoes are particularly affected. Temperature plays a crucial role in determining the sexual characteristics of cucumber plants. Specifically, colder temperatures leads to a higher occurrence of female flowers, while warmer temperatures promote the production of male flowers. Carrots exhibit optimal root development, color, texture and size at temperatures ranging from 10– 15°C. However, low temperatures of around 13.0°C in tomatoes lead to a drop in flowering. Slight variations in temperature and rainfall can substantially influence the quality of vegetables, thereby impacting both domestic and international trade related to these crops. Alterations in temperature and humidity levels will also have an impact on pest populations.
