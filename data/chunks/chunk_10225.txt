 India has been successful to contain wheat rusts during the past five decades even when all the adjoining countries had epidemics (Bhardwaj et al. 2019). Anticipatory breeding for rust-resistant wheat is in place and molecular markers are assisted to deploy more than one resistance gene as a gene deployment strategy (Tomar et al. 2014). The success in containing rusts has now become a model system for the management of plant diseases. HD 2967, HD 3086, and DBW 187 are considered the mega varieties for their wider adaptability and pest & disease resistance especially yellow and brown rust. HD 2967 occupied around 10 Mha, followed by HD 3086 with 4.7 Mha and DBW 187 with 1.89 Mha. Similar to DBW 187, DBW 222 and HD 3226 are now emerging as a preferred and promising variety among farmers. The progress of research in terms of wheat quality has been remarkable and gained an impetus with a special focus on bio-fortification. India’s first biofortified variety in wheat, WB 02 (42 ppm Zn and 40 ppm Fe) along with HPBW 1 was released in 2017. Twenty-six other biofortified wheat varieties were also released for defeating malnutrition in the country. In addition, promising wheat genotypes were identified for value addition and nutritional quality. For instance, the average sedimentation value, which is an indicator for flour recovery and palatable for bread making has witnessed a significant improvement in the recent decade. Box 3: HD 2967-Securing nation on food front HD 2967 is a double dwarf wheat variety, has contributed significantly to the national food security. It is resistant to rust disease has replaced the susceptible variety PBW343. It is the most preferred wheat cultivar and covering 11 million ha presently.
