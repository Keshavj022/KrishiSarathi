 The scheme has been expected to significantly enhance the actual prices realisation by the potato farmers as potato is a bulky produce and informed selling decision will save him/ her from distress sale on account of heavy cold storage/ transportation charges. APMC act has some bindings on the farmers which reduce latter’s freedom in selling the produce at his/her will. For ensuring better prices to the farmer the government have been tirelessly pursuing implementation of Model Act throughout the country and a greater number of states is adopting the Model Act. This reform will make modern agricultural practices like Contract Farming more effective for the farmers to get better prices and to mitigate their market related risk with his/her ability to exercise the freedom to sell to multiple buyers. Potato farmers being one of the biggest beneficiaries contact farming will continue to benefit to higher level under the Model Act. Steps and schemes for income supplementation After duly recognising the urgency of increasing farmers’ income, the union government of India announced and implemented steep enhancement in support price of principal agricultural commodities during 2018-19 under the famous ‘50% plus cost of cultivation scheme (A2 cost plus imputed value of family labour)’. However, this measure being not sufficient in itself, the promulgation of farmers’ income supplementation schemes like Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (` 6000 per year income supplementation) provides the additional evidence of concerted efforts towards this gargantuan goal. Some of the resource rich states have also announced farmers’ income supplementation schemes through Direct Benefit Transfer like Rythu Bandhu scheme of Telangana and Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income (KALIA) scheme of Odisha as prominent examples. As potato farmers were not the beneficiary of higher support price, small and marginal of them could get some support out of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, Rythu Bandhu scheme of Telangana and KALIA scheme of Odisha.
