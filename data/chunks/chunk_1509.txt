 Promoting oilseed crops through crop diversification Sunflower in Nizamabad district of Telangana: Identifying the potential of sunflower in the region, ICAR–Indian Institute of Oilseeds Research (IIOR), Hyderabad, along with KVK and State Department of Agriculture officers, had demonstrated the best management practices with DRSH-1 hybrid in Hegdoli village of Nizamabad district during rabi seasons of 2017- 2019. Other existing schemes of soil health cards and skill development training were converged. Supplying the needed P through SSP and directed spray of B @ 0.2% at ray floret opening stage, irrigation at critical stages (2 to 3 vs. 6 to 8 for maize), and minimal or need-based plant protection resulted in realizing a higher seed yield of 2,500-3,000 kg/ha (16-24% improvement) with high profitability at ` 45,000 - 60,000/acre in 100 - 105 days Thus, the area under sunflower expanded from about 400 ha in 2016 to more than 7000 ha in 2021-22 in the district. The irrigation water was also saved, including expenditure on electricity. Further, the beekeepers association was persuaded to introduce an apiary in Hegdoli village and 500 kg of pure sunflower honey was harvested in 3 weeks in the first batch. Observing the potential of the area, they started an apiary with 800 bee hive boxes in a large sunflower area of about 2,000 acres. Around 5200 kg of pure sunflower honey was harvested in a period of two months and sold @ `300/kg (Table 1) in the name of ‘Honey Natural’. Apiary is a win-win situation for sunflower farmers and the village level entrepreneurs, whereby farmers perceived that the yield of sunflower increased by 20% due to honey bee activity and provided a sustainable livelihood to the local entrepreneur. This model can be replicated in rice- fallow areas and also to encourage agri-entrepreneurship through honey bee keeping and honey production. Table 1.

Traditionally, tribal farmers do cultivate cotton, soybean, redgram, during kharif in black cotton soils. Farmers with access to irrigation during rabi cultivate chickpea, fodder sorghum and wheat. Most of the farmers keep the land fallow after cotton. Of late, due to severe pink boll worm infestation, it is not profitable to extend the cotton crop after January. Provision and construction of new farm pond in the locality provided an opportunity to raise second and third crop. Summer sesame provides an opportunity as second crop after cotton. As a part of diversification activity, IIOR promoted safflower crop after harvesting soybean and planting summer sesame after cotton as a bonus crop.
