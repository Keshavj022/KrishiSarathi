 Application of 30 kg N/ha significantly increased seed yield and swelling factor of seed was reduced significantly due to application of higher dose of N (45 kg /ha). In kalmegh (Andrographis paniculata), application of N through organic and inorganic sources enhanced dry herbage yield significantly over control. Application of 20 kg N/ha through castor cake would be the best option for getting higher yield of kalmegh. In babchi (Psoralea corylifolia), application of 40 kg N+20kg P/ha resulted in significantly higher branches/plant, ears/plant, seed yield and psoralin content of seed, 40 cm × 30cm spacing gave 24.20 and 3.12% higher seed yield compared to 30 cm × 30 cm and 60 cm × 30cm respectively. In isabgol, spraying of mancozeb (0.3%) did not significantly increase the yield though the per cent disease index of downy mildew was significantly lower than the unsprayed control. Poppy capsules are ready for latex extraction ● Fifteen germplasm lines of Ashwa- gandha were evaluated NEW DEVELOPMENT In opium poppy, Chetak Aphim proved its superiority with respect to latex (97.80 kg/ ha) and morphine yield (19.61 kg/ha). At NDUAT, NOP 530, NOP 549 and Kirtiman were found to be superior performers in latex and seed yield. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 68 POSTHARVEST MANAGEMENT Postharvest treatment of mango fruits with chlorine water improved ripening of fruits and also reduced microbial load significantly. Shelf-life of Kesar mango fruits could be extended up to 54 days when treated with combination of waxol (6%)+ carbendazim (0.1%) and stored in cool store followed by 30 days when stored in cool chamber and 58 days when stored at room temperature. Application of ethrel 500 ppm and storing in zero-energy cool chamber in order to obtain a uniform golden yellow colour could successfully regulate the ripening of banana. Hot benomyl application (500 ppm) and stem-end waxing were found to double the shelf-life of banana Basrai (10 days as against 5 days in control) at ambient condition. The treated banana fruits when packed under modified atmosphere packaging could be stored up to 30 days at 13°C as against 15 days in unpacked control fruits. Bunches of Red Banana covered with 1.0% ventilated blue polyethylene bags reduced the time taken for maturity to 115 days (139.2 days in control), increased bunch weight (12.4 kg), pulp weight, ascorbic acid, total sugars and reducing sugar. Kinnow fruits dipped in 0.05% Bavistin and 4 fruits packed in each polyethylene bags retained the best quality during storage. Dipping of fruits with 50% stay fresh 960 also proved effective. Mosambi sweet orange and acid lime fruits wrapped in vented polyethylene liner could be stored in evaporative cool chamber up to 42 and 30 days, respectively. Fumigation of litchi Bombai for 15 minutes followed by dipping in pH 1 solution for 5 min. was most effective to retain red colour of dehydrated fruits up to 45 days.
