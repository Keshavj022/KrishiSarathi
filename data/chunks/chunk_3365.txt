Agricultural Education - Present Setup Establishment of Post Graduate School at IARI in 1958 was a landmark step that heralded establishment of agricultural universities in India. Today, we have a net work of 53 State Agricultural Universities (SAUs, including 16 specialized Veterinary and Animal Sciences and Horticulture and Forestry Sciences Universities), one Central Agricultural University (CAU), five Institutes having Deemed-to-be-Universities (DUs) status (four of them are ICAR Institutes: IARI, New Delhi; IVRI, Izatnagar; NDRI, Karnal and CIFE, Mumbai and, the fifth Allahabad Agricultural Institute, Allahabad) and four Central Universities (CUs) with Agriculture faculty (BHU, Varanasi; AMU, Aligarh; Vishwa Bharti, Shantiniketan and Nagaland University, Medziphema). The universities are modeled on US land grant university pattern with integration of education, research and extension education and, have contributed a great deal in propelling agricultural growth in the country. With about 265 constituent colleges having about 35,000 student- intake capacity, the AUs impart education in 11 major disciplines at undergraduate and about 95 subjects at post-graduate level. In higher agricultural education, about 55% students are from rural back ground and, on an average, 36% are the girl students. Besides, the IIT, Kharagpur imparts education in the field of Agricultural Engineering, and about 100 privately owned colleges, majority of them affiliated to general universities while some, particularly in the States of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, affiliated to SAUs, impart higher agricultural education to over 10000 students annually. 1.1.2.
