 The feed cost is Rs 15/animal per day. l Complete feed/TMR based on 52.0% wheat straw, 23.0% deoiled groundnut- cake, 9.0% Prosopis juliflora pods, 8.0% corn steep liquor, 5.0% molasses, 1.0% salt and 2.0% mineral mixture supports the growth rate of 468 g/day in growing calves. The feed cost/kg gain decreased by 46.35 and 36.84% in complete feed and TMR (total mixed ration), respectively, over the conventional rations. Lactating Animals l 30.0% wheat straw, 20.0% Prosopis juliflora pods, 6.5% rice bran, 5.0% wheat bran, 26.0% deoiled groundnut-cake, 0.5% urea,1.0% salt, 2.0% mineral mixture, and 10.0% molasses could be used as ration of lactating cows without any adverse effects on milk yield and milk fat%. l 45.0% wheat straw, 25.0% deoiled groundnut-cake, 14.0% Prosopis juliflora pods, 3.5% babul seed chuni, 10.0% molasses, 1.0% salt, 1.0% mineral mixture and 0.5% urea could be used as ration of lactating cows without any adverse effect on production performance of cows. Total mixed ration is 8.66% economical than complete feed in terms of feed cost/kg milk yield. It decreases the feed cost/kg milk yield by 36.58% over conventional system of feeding. AFLATOXIN DETOXIFICATION Aflatoxin production was maximum in flake (ungrounded) form of feed as compared to meal (ground) form. Storage of feeds in open containers increased the aflatoxin production. Feeds stored in HDPE bags developed brownish green discolouration due to anaerobic conditions. Among the several antifungal agents screened propionic acid, copper sulphate, ammonia and sodium hypochlorite were most effective in preventing the growth of Aspergillus fungi. AFLATOXIN EFFECT No harmful effects on growth and feed intake in broilers were noticed when the aflatoxin level was maintained below 100ppb in feed. At 200 and 400ppb levels a significant depression in growth (19 and 40.6% respectively) and feed intake (16.4 and 38.2% respectively) was observed. The broilers fed 200 and 400ppb levels of toxin revealed marked pathological changes by enlarged liver (31.6 and 79.5% respectively) and kidney (38.6 and 116.3% respectively) besides a reduction in the size of thymus (14.5 and 39.1%, respectively). Skin pigmentation assessed against shank colour was poor with increased toxin level. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002â€“2003 120 Adult Animals l 55.0% wheat straw, 22.0% Prosopis juliflora pods, 20.0% corn steep liquor,1.0% salt, 1.0% urea and 2.0% mineral mixture provides 6.7% DCP and 61.2% TDN. It forms an economic balanced ration for livestock. l 60.0% wheat straw, 22.5% deoiled groundnut-cake, 5.0%, Prosopis pods, 10.0% molasses, 0.5% urea, 1.0% salt and 1.0% mineral mixture, provides 9.7% DCP and 54.2% TDN which is adequate for maintenance of adult cattle.
