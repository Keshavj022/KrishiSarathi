 Two irrigation is required first at pre flowering stage (45 DAS) and second if needed at pod filling stage (75 DAS). Apply 20kg sulphur/ha at the time of sowing resulted more yield Lathyrus (Khesari) Generally, horse gram is grown as paira cropping or mixed copping with linseed and sowing start from last week of October to mid of November. Use improved varieties like Bio L212 (Ratan), LS 147-14 (Prateek), B1(Nirmal), Pusa 24, RLS 4595, LSD 3, LSD 6 Sow the crop with the spacing of 30X10cm and 40 kg/ha seed rate for dual purpose and for line sowing 25-30kg/ha for grain crop. Use recommended dose of fertilizer in pulses are 20 kg N (45 kg urea), 40 kg P2O5 (250 kg SSP) and 20 kg K (36 kg muriate of potash) at the time of sowing of seed through seed cum fertilizer drill. Apply 20kg Sulphur per ha at the time of sowing gives better yield. Field pea Ideal time for sowing of field pea is mid-October to mid-November and this ensures good crop stand and escapes from the attack of insect pest and diseases. Delayed sown crop is more prone to wilt diseases Use high yielding varieties- Rachna, Aparna, Malviya Matar 15, Pusa Prabhat, VL matar 42, Swarna Tripti. Treat the seed with rhizobium culture @ 10g/ kg seed before sowing. Seed rate 70-80 kg/ha (long duration variety) and 100 kg/ha (short duration variety) and recommended spacing 30cmX10 cm for long duration variety and 22.5cmX10 cm for short duration variety at a depth of 4-5 cm. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 177 To obtain better yield apply 20 kg N (45 kg urea), 40 kg P2O5 (250 kg SSP) and 20 kg K (36 kg muriate of potash) at the time of sowing of seed through seed cum fertilizer drill. Apply 20kg sulphur/ha at the time of sowing resulted in higher grain yield and better soil health Two irrigation is necessary for Field pea first irrigation at before flowering and second irrigation at pod filling stage. Oilseeds Rapeseed/Mustard If sufficient soil is not available give one pre sowing irrigation for better seed germination. Start the sowing of mustard from 1st week October and complete by 2nd week November. Early sown crop has less infestation of aphid and leaf blight. Rapeseed/Mustard to be sown at 30cmX10-15cm spacing and at 4-5cm depth. Before sowing treat the seed with tricoderma@10g/ kg of seed. To maintain optimum plant population thinning out operation must be done after three week of sowing and maintain the healthy seedling. Grow improved variety of mustard Timely sown: Sej 2, Pusa Mahak and Pusa Bold; Late sown: Rajendra Rai Pichheti, Rajendra Anukool, Ashirvad; RH0749, T9,44S- 01, RGN 73, NRCHB 101, DRMR 150-35, NRCYS-05-02 Rajendra Suflam Toria: RAUTS 17, Panchali; and Yellow Sarson: Rajendra Sarson 1, Ragini, Benoy according to availability of growing period and purpose. Plough the field and make well pulverized and apply basal dose of fertilizer before final preparation or sowing to be done using seed cum fertilizer drill. Apply 10-12 MT FYM and 60-90 kg N, 60kg P2O5 and 40kg K20/ha.
