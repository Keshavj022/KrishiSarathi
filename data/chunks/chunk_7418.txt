 The sprayer discharge is adjustable in the vertical direction having range of 18–22 m and droplet size 200–500 μm. Tractor operated intra row cum inter row weeder for orchards: A low hp tractor operated intra row cum inter row weeder was developed. It is easy to extend and retract the rotary unit by swiveling action of hydro-mechanically controlled sensor. Hence, there of the machine is 95%. There is net saving of ` 1,775/ha in pomegranate orchard and ` 1,480/ha in grape vineyard over traditional method. Sprayer equipped with electro-pneumatic system to control whitefly in cotton crop: The cotton crop is cultivated in an area of 0.67 million ha in Haryana with production of 1.63 million bales. The whitefly attack causes a lot of damage to cotton crop resulting into reduction of plant growth and crop yield in Haryana state. A prototype of sprayer equipped with electro- pneumatic system was developed. At 550 PTO rpm, the aspirator speed, forward speed, effective field capacity and field efficiency of machine were 1,825 rpm, 1.74 km/h, 0.091 ha/h and 78.45%, respectively which resulted in 38% reduction in number of whitefly. Similarly, at 760 PTO rpm, the aspirator speed, forward speed, effective field capacity and field efficiency of machine were 3,018 rpm, 3.45 km/h, 0.15 ha/h and 65.22%, respectively, which succeeded in 40% reduction in number of whitefly. And at 860 PTO rpm, the aspirator speed, forward speed, effective field capacity and field efficiency of unit were 4,068 rpm, 4.19 km/h, MECHANIZATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 89 0.168 ha/h and 60%, respectively, which reduced 42% whitefly. Tractor operated planter for tissue culture banana: Conventional planting of tissue culture banana is done manually making the process labour intensive and tedious. Therefore, a tractor operated planter for tissue culture banana was developed by AICRP on FIM (TNAU, Coimbatore centre). The planter can plant tissue culture banana at a spacing of 1.82×1.52 m. The valve is designed to open automatically at fixed plant to plant spacing of 1.52 m through ground wheel measuring system with the help of cam and lever. Seedlings are earthed up by a suitable shovel and the soil around the plant is compacted by the set of press rollers. The effective field capacity of the machine is 0.19 ha/h. Cost of the planter is ` 50,000 and cost of operation is ` 3,500/ha. The operation can be done timely and accurate plant spacing may be maintained, thus leading to higher productivity. It helps in saving 50% in time, 81% in cost of operation, and 90% in labour requirement as compared to traditional practice of manual planting. unit and eventually in the bruised straw. For wheat crop variety HD 2967, the average effective field capacity of the machine was 0.30 ha/h at forward speed of 2.02 km/h. The fuel consumption of the machine was 6.28 l/h.
