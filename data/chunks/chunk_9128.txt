 Many of them are still used the world over as donor sources for improvement of quality and disease resistance; predominant are HINDI 62, HD 2160, NP 4 and NP 52 for quality, NP 770, NP 809 and NP 829 for resistance to rust. They all are poor yielding. NP 809 is the first variety to have manifested substantial resistance against the three rusts. Incorporation of ‘Norin 10’ dwarfing gene from the semi-dwarf varieties introduced from CIMMYT in the sixties conspicuously improved our wheat yields.

The production level of the wheat crop has thus risen from 10.4 million tonnes in 1965-66 to 63 million tonnes in 1994-95; productivity to 2,323 kg/ha from 827 kg/ha. Systematic research on the wheat crop began in 1905 at the Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, Bihar, which moved to New Delhi after 1936. Directorate of Wheat Research, starting off as the Alllndia Coordinated Wheat Improvement Project in 1965, has helped in accelerating breeding research. It is the national centre for research on the wheat crop. Ninety per cent of the 24.5 million hectares cultivated with the wheat crop is sown with 40-50 high-yielding varieties. The more popular being the irrigated HD 2285, WH 542, UP 2338, PBW 343 for North-West Plains Zone; K 8804, K 9006, HP 1633 for North-East Plains Zone; HI 1077, GW 190 for Central Zone and SUJATA, C 306 and K 8027 for the rainfed regions. HD 2329 and HD 2285, released a decade ago, are still grown in 4 million hectares of irrigated land. Durum wheat PBW 343 and PDW 215 developed for export have excellent grain characteristics.

The Indian wheat varieties SONALIKA, WL 711, HD 2009 and HD 2172 are being cultivated in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Sudan and Syria, Sown in 90 per cent of wheat area, HD 2172 has paved way for self-sufficiency in foodgrains in Sudan. Wheat breeders have developed in all 200 varieties irrigated and rainfed for sowing on time or late in the north-west plains, north-east plains, central India, peninsular India and the northern hills; in salt-affected soils and as durum wheat for export. They have also contributed in the development of varieties resistant to Karnal Bunt, being now used as donor sources elsewhere.
