 Climate and selection of site: Lilium thrives well in partial shade during its growth period and can be cultivated under protected environments. In regions with a cool climate during its growth, high-quality flowers can be cultivated successfully under shade/polyhouse conditions. For high-quality flower production, lilies require a light intensity of 2000-3000 foot candles. In conditions of low light, such as a photoperiod of less than 12-14 hours, implementing an 8 hr night interruption is crucial to prevent bud drop in lilies. Lilies benefit from shading, typically around 40-50% shade. The most suitable temperature for achieving optimum growth of lilium plants falls within the range of 8-20Â°C. Soil and soil preparation: Lilium has the ability to thrive in various soil types, as long as the soil possesses favourable structure and drainage. However, optimal flowers are obtained in sandy loam soil. The presence of heavy clay soil, characterized by inadequate drainage, hampers plant growth by impeding root development and excessive soil moisture conditions result in disease incidence. Yet, heavy soils can be rendered into cultivable form by incorporating sand along with well-rotted FYM. Cultivation is best suited for soil with a pH range between 5.5-6.5. For both flower and bulb production, lilium requires weed-free, well-prepared sandy soil. Soil treatment: Soil sterilization can be carried out using 2% formaldehyde at a rate of 25 Lit/acre and this should be done at least 1 month before planting. A depth of 30-40 cm soil is excavated from the beds and the bottom soil is swiftly saturated with a formaldehyde solution. Subsequently, trench is refilled and levelled with excavated soil. Following this, bed is promptly closed with polyethylene sheets for about 15 days. After sheet removal, thoroughly irrigate before planting. Selection of cultivars: The choice of cultivars for cut-flower production is contingent on several factors, like suitable cultivar for the chosen site, plant height, flower size, market preferences regarding colour and the availability of bulbs. Pure white, yellow and pink colours are predominantly favoured and exhibit high demand in the markets. Nutritional requirements: Lilium does not require excessive fertilization. As lilium is salt sensitive, the elevated salt levels in the soil due to excessive fertilization can impede both root growth and flowering. The fertilizer needs differ, based on soil type, fertilizer used, soil salt content and prevailing climatic conditions. To improve soil structure, mix well-decomposed FYM @ 5-8 kg per m2 on soil surface. The soil was prepared for bulb planting by integrating a specified amount of sand, FYM, Phosphorus and Potassium in the form of Single Super Phosphate (SSP) and Muriate of Potash (MoP). Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN), preferred @ 1 kg/100 sqm in two split doses after sprouting the lilum bulbs in field conditions.
