5% thrice at 40, 60 and 80 days after sowing significantly increased the yield 1.46 t/ha. • Similarly spraying of NAA 10 ppm, twice at 40, & 60 days after sowing gave maximum yield. • Application of T. harzianum as seed treatment as well as soil application recorded maximum yield and minimum incidence of wilt in coriander. Seed treatment with P. fluorescens @ 10 g/kg + soil application of P. fluorescens @ 5 kg /ha is an effective biocontrol agent for coriander wilt. • Powdery mildew could be managed by applying carbendazim as soil drench and spray (0.01%) as well as spraying of neem seed kernel extract (NSKE 5%) thrice. Cumin • The centers hold 621 accessions including 13 exotic ones. In Cumin, UC‐310, JC‐2002‐22 (Jobner) were identified as promising. • Cumin varieties viz. RZ‐223 (600 kg/ha) and RZ‐341 (405 kg/ha) from Jobner, Gujarat cumin ‐4 from Jagudan which yields 1250 kg/ha were identified for release. • Application of 100% in organic nitrogen + Azospirillum @ 1.5 kg/ha as seed treatment + 5 t FYM /ha resulted in maximum seed in cumin (320kg/ha) with maximum B: C ratio (1:39). • In cumin maximum yield was obtained by controlling blight and wilt disease with application of mancozeb @ 0.25% at 40, 50,60 and 70 days after sowing. www.icar.org.in 72 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Horticulture • For the control of aphids in cumin two sprays of monocrotophos and acephate were found effective. • Application of Trichoderma +FYM and spraying with Mancozeb @ 0.25% reduced wilt incidence to 5% and recorded seed yield of 308 kg/ha. • Wilt resistant variety of cumin‐GC‐4 (Gujarat cumin‐4) developed by AICRP Jagudan Centre has been identified for release. Fennel • Four hundred and eighty five accessions including 24 exotic accessions were maintained at centers. • Fennel UF‐177 (Jobner) J. Fen‐210 (Kumarganj) HF‐116 (Hisar) JF‐332 (Jagudan) were identified as promising. • Fennel varieties identified for release are RF‐178 (1600 kg/ha) and RF‐143 (1200 kg/ha) from Jobner, Gujarat Fennel‐11 from Jagudan (2489 kg/ha). Hisar Swarup from Hisar (1600‐1800 kg/ha). • Application of 100% inorganic N + Azospirillum @ 1.5 kg/ha + 5t FYM/ha resulted in maximum yield in fennel (1.16 t/ha). Fenugreek • A total of 1119 fenugreek accessions including 12 exotic accessions were maintained at the centers. • UF‐351, UF‐352 (Jobner) J.F‐244 (Guntur) HM‐114 (Kumarganj) HM‐292 (Hisar) JF‐270 (Coimbatore), HM‐444 (Dholi) J.Fenu.239 (Jagudan) are identified for further testing. • Fenugreek RMt‐351 (1840 kg/ha) and RMt‐305 (1300 kg/ha) from Jobner, Guj.Methi‐2 (1920 kg/ha) from Jagudan were identified as promising varieties for release. • Application of 100% inorganic N alone give the highest yield of 1. 256 t/ha in the inorganic fertilizer trial supplementing biofertilizer. • Carbendazim as soil treatment alone or along with soil drenching proved highly effective against root rot in fenugreek. • Soil application of T.
