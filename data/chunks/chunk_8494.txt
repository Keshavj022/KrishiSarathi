It is a white-seeded selection from JLT 26 × RT 12, identified for release in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 33 l Sesame + urdbean (2 : 2) in Madhya Pradesh, sesame + groundnut and sesame + mungbean (2 : 2) in Rajasthan and sesame + cotton (3 : 1) in Gujarat proved remunerative cropping systems. Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. MT 75 matures in 88 days and gives average yield of 0.6–0.8 tonne/ha. It is resistant to phyllody, leaf curl and powdery mildew and is moderately resistant to Phytophthora blight and Macrophomina stem/root-rot. Strains OS-Sel 2 and Sekhar have showed promise at the advanced stage of testing at the national level for kharif and JCS 388 and JCS 390 for rabi/summer season. Crop Production The maximum seed yields could be obtained with 50% N through urea + 50% N through FYM + phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB) + 50% P + K at Amreli; 50% N through urea + 50% N through FYM + PSB + P + K at Kayankulam; 50% N through urea + 50% N through thumba-cake + P + K at Mandore; 100% N through urea + PSB + 50% P + K at Mauranipur. Sesame + urdbean (2 : 2) in Madhya Pradesh, sesame + groundnut and sesame + mungbean (2 : 2) in Rajasthan and sesame + cotton (3 : 1) in Gujarat and sesame + soybean (3 : 3) in Maharashtra are found remunerative sesame-based intercropping systems; and increase in yield was from 28 to 75%. Crop Protection OS-Sel 2 and OS-Sel 24 are found resistant to Macrophomina stem/root rot and phyllody, and Sekhar is resistant to phyllody only. Entry OS-Sel 253 has been observed to be free from leaf curl. Endosulfan at 1.5 litre/ha at 30 and 45 DAS was effective against Antigastra and Dasyneura pests. Resistant variety+ seed treatment with Carbendazim 50 WP (0.1%) + Thiram (0.2%) or Carbendazim 50 WP (0.2%) alone or Trichoderma viride (0.4%) +two sprays of Azadirachitin (0.03%) or Mancozeb (0.25%) + Endosulfan (0.07%) at 30–45 and 45–55 days after sowing + intercropping with mungbean/pigeonpea/ urdbean minimized incidence of Antigastra and Dasyneura and Macrophomina stem/root rot, Alternaria leaf-spot and Cercospora leaf-spot. NIGER A high-yielding, early-maturing niger JC 1 has been released for niger-growing areas of Madhya Pradesh. JNS 14 and JNS 13 have showed promise in the advanced varietal trial. Over 0.
