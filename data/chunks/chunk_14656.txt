 More new studies should go beyond the seedling stage, especially to harvest. This would give more information on the performance and viability of BP fertilizers.

Such factors contribute to food shortages and food insecurity, which threaten the livelihood of humans [2,3]. Researchers have developed alternative strategies to grow crops faster and enrich the soil with the necessary nutrients using chemical fertilizers to meet the demands for food [4–7]. Chemical fertilizers are industrially manufactured to contain a specific number of nutrients required by the soil to enhance plant growth [8]. The most common chemical fertilizer is NPK, i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which contains nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in different ratios. Superphosphate, urea, and potash are also popular. For a substance to be classified as a fertilizer, it should contain a minimum of 5% N, P, or K, known as the primary or macro-nutrients [9,10]. They play a vital role in enhancing plant development and growth. Indeed, their functions and how they contribute to soil fertility are well documented [11–14]. However, due to their efficiency in increasing soil fertility and enhancing plant growth, chemical fertilizers are often applied in excess [15]. As a result, they cause adverse effects on the environment, such as global warming, biodiversity loss, depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, and eutrophication [9,16,17]. Besides their excessive use, their huge procurement, shipping, and transportation costs make them unsustainable [18]. There are several strategies that re- searchers have developed to reduce and circumvent the effects that synthetic fertilizers have Agriculture 2024, 14, 1894. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14111894 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture Agriculture 2024, 14, 1894 2 of 24 on the environment. These include applying organic-based fertilizers such as fruit peels (e.g., banana peels) [19], nano-fertilizers [20], using improved methods of application [21], and slow-nutrient-release fertilizers [22–24]. Organic fertilizers are naturally occurring fertilizers derived from agricultural waste (plant and animal waste) [16]. Animal waste or by-products include cow dung, slaughter- house waste, eggshells, manure (chicken, horse, goat, sheep, and rabbit), urine, bone meal, and fish emulsion [25,26]. Plant waste materials include straw, corn stalks, livestock feed (alfalfa meal), cottonseed meal, molasses, green manure, duckweed kelp seaweed, and used tea waste. Various parts of the plant, such as the leaves and (pseudo) stem, can be used as a fertilizer. Organic fertilizers consist of moderate amounts of the essential nutrients for plant growth, i.e., nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium [27].
