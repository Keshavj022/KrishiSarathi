 Similarly, Parkash, a single- cross hybrid, developed by the PAU, Ludhiana, was found distinct from others. Crop Production For hybrid seed production, nitrogen at 180 kg/ha and plant spacing of 60 cm × 20 cm were found the best. In maize-soybean intercropping, application of Alachlor at 2 kg/ha proved most effective in controlling weeds. This herbicide was very effective for baby-corn production. FYM at 10 tonnes/ha with NPK resulted in significant yield increases of maize at Kangra, Bajaura and Almora. Crop Protection A set of 145, set A × B RILs (recombinant inbred lines), along with their parental lines (Ki3 and CMLl, 139) were analyzed for detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for downy mildew (DM) resistance. The study has indicated a major QTL MAIZE GENOTYPES RESISTANT TO BIOTIC STRESSES Maydis leaf blight F 7001, AH 918, AH 915, FH 3097, PRO 340, FH 3138, JH 068-2, KH 5991 Turcicum leaf blight R 9601, X 520, F 7001, AH 387, PRO.340, X 3342 Sorghum downy mildew PMZ 128, PRO 340, FH 3138, SSFX 9199, KH 5991 Browny stripe downy mildew CMH 7, SEEDTECH 2331, AH 916, AH 387, F 7001, AH 187, AH 915, AH 918, FH 3113, SSFX 9195, JK 0682, KH 5991, JH 3795, JH 3725, KH 081, JKMH 178-14 Post-flowering stalk rot JH 3795, JKMH 178-4 on chromosome 6, which appears stable across diverse environments, besides the specific QTLs controlling resistance to sorghum downy mildew and Rajasthan downy mildew. SORGHUM Crop Improvement CSV 17 (SPV 1489) is a new early-maturing variety (90–95 days) with 30.7% higher yield (2,709 kg/ha), and has increased resistance to grain moulds than check SPV 96. This variety will be suitable for moisture-stress areas in Rajasthan and elsewhere. A dual-purpose hybrid, SPH 1148, developed at the National Research Centre on Sorghum, has recorded superior grain and fodder yields in multilocation trials (1998–2001). The hybrid is based on the new MS line MS 463 A{SPV 463 (IS 2947 IS 232 CO 22) 2219 B} and R line NR 486 {CS 3541 PAB 34 (IS 23521)}. This yields 4.15 tonnes of grains/ha and 11.2 tonnes of fodder/ha, which is a record 17.3% and 9.8% and 6% and 14.3% increase over checks CSH 18 and CSH 16 for grain and fodder yields. Pyramiding genes for grain hardness in sorghum to attain moderate levels of grain hardness and incorporating genes for light glume colour could increase levels of grain-mould resistance in white-grain background. Crop Protection The stable sources of resistances identified are IS 18557, IS 18676, IS 18677, PJ DHM 2 maize is a state release for Karnataka for kharif. It yields 5.4 tonnes of yellow semi-flint bold grains per hectare l Released CSV 17 sorghum (suitable for moisture stress) with increased grain-mould resistance than check SPV 96. l Sorghum cultivars developed with CS 3541 in their parentage contributed to high degree of resistance in R lines (C 43, RS 29, MR 836). SPH 1148 sorghum hybrid is based on the new MS line MS 463 and R line NR 486.
