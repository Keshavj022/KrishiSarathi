 Once planted root slips give fodder for 2-3 years by good management.8 to 9 % crude protein is found in this fodder. Following varieties are recommended for cultivation- C.O. -3, C.O.-5, R.B.N.-13, Sampoorn (DNH-6), IGFRI-7 and 10. Under irrigated condition, it should be planted by root or stem cuttings in February- March. Planting should be done in 60 cm row to row and plant to plant spacing, 30000 to 35000 rooted slips are required for one-hectare area. During last field preparation, 20- 25 tonnes well-rotted F.Y.M. be incorporated in the soil and during transplanting 60 kg Nitrogen, 50 kg Phosphorus, and 40 kg Potash per hectare should be given basal and 30 kg Nitrogen be given after each cutting. First cut is obtained after 60-75 days of planting and after each 40-45 days 5 to 6 cuttings can be done. Berseem Berseem is the most important rabi fodder crop since it gives 4 to 5 cuts from November to March. The fodder is very nutritive and liked by the animals, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen into the soil being leguminous crop. It contains 17 to 21% protein, 12 to 15% dry matter and is very digestive. Following varieties are found good for cultivation in Chhattisgarh- Maskavi, Vardan, Bundel ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 338 Berseem-2, Bundel Berseem-3, J.B.-5, Pusa Jiant, U.P.B.-110, JHTB 96-4, B.L.-22. Berseem should be sown from 15 October to 15 November for taking 5-6 cuts. Optimum seed rate is 25-30 kg / ha. 20 kg Nitrogen, 80 kg Phosphorus and 40 kg Potash per hectare be applied for good harvest. For weed control Oxyflorfen 0.1 kg a.i. and Emzethapyre 0.1 kg a.i. per hectare should be applied immediately after first harvest. Irrigation be given after 15-20 days interval and in March-April, at the interval of 10 to 12 days. Vegetable Crops Tomato: Tomato is taken almost round the year, the following improved varieties are recommended for cultivation in Chhattisgarh- Pusa early Dwarf, Sweet 72, Pusa Ruby, Pusa Gaurav, Naveen, Mangala, C.O.-1, C.O.-2, PantTamatar-3, DVRT-2, C.o.-3, N.S.-815, avinash-2, Selection-7, Arka Rakshhak. Sowing should be completed in October- November, seed should be done @ 400-500 gram / ha in O.P. varieties and 125-150 gram / ha in case of hybrid varieties. Seed should be treated with Thirum @ 2.5 gram / kg seed. 150 kg Nitrogen, 100 kg phosphorus and 75 kg potash should be applied. For controlling Damping Off soil solarization is the most effective measure. Seed should be treated by Thirum@ 2.5 gram per kg seed or Copper Oxy chloride @ 3 gram per kg seed. Seed should be treated by Trichoderma powder or Trichoderma + Pseudomonas @ 8-10 gram per kg seed. Cauliflower: Following varieties should be selected for sowing during October- November- Early Kunwari, Pusa Kartik, Pusa Dipali, pusa shubha, Pusa Snowball-2, Pusa sharad. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 339 Sowing should be completed in September-October at the rate of 400-500 gram per hectare.
