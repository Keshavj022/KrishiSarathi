 The striking feature is that 30 new varieties with multiple stress tolerance were developed by use of new tools of molecular breeding that imparted higher precision to the variety selection process. In horticultural crops, 329 varieties were developed and notified during 2014-19 against 269 during 2009-14 to supplement nutrition and income security Number of Varieties released TECHNOLOGIES AND INITIATIVES FOR FARMERS’ WELFARE 10 yy 52 crop varieties either bio- fortified with higher levels of Fe, Zn, protein, provitamin A etc. in the edible parts or with reduced level of antinutritional factors were developed during 2014-19 against only one variety during 2009-14. These varieties have been brought under seed chain to make the nutritious food available to the consumers. A total of 3483.8 quintals of breeder seed of 16 such varieties have been produced during 2016-17 to 2018-19 yy Quality planting material for horticultural crops are the critical input for horticultural expansion. ICAR institutes enhanced the production of quality planting materials by 62.4% in cuttings (from 57.2 lakh to 93.4 lakh); 71.5% in bulbs (from 963.153 lakh to 1653.131 lakh) and 89.1 % in saplings (2710.10 to 5125.0 lakh) during 2014-19 as compared to 2009-14 Traits targeted for Biofortfication TECHNOLOGIES AND INITIATIVES FOR FARMERS’ WELFARE 11 yy ICAR is the nodal agency for coordination of Breeder Seed production in the country. The breeder seed production increased by 10% during 2014-19 as compared to the previous five years. The seed replacement rate in pulses, oilseeds and cereals increased substantially over time yy As per the indents raised by different States and other agencies, ICAR produces and supplies the Breeder seeds yy The Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) also produced quality seeds and planting materials, those were provided to the farmers. The seed production in KVKs increased by about 40% from 10.1 lakh quintals to 14.16 lakh quintals and the planting materials by 184% from 853.15 lakh to 2425.45 lakh during 2014-19 as compared to 2009-14 TECHNOLOGIES AND INITIATIVES FOR FARMERS’ WELFARE 12 B. Pulses Revolution India registered a significant jump in pulses production through productivity increase by 24% over 2015-16 resulting in a net production of 25.42 million tonnes in 2018- 19. Varietal replacement through enhanced breeder seed supply of new varieties contributed to this scenario. Besides, area expansions under new varieties happened due to government policies of creating 2 million tons of buffer stock, ensuring minimum government support price and enhanced government procurement. Establishment of 150 seed hubs ensured availability of quality seeds and the KVKs led large-scale frontline demonstrations enabled an ecosystem for productivity increase as well as area expansion. C.
