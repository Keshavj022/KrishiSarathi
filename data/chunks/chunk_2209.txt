 Faced with food grain crisis, India realized the benefits of dwarf wheat varieties and production was doubled within five years (1966-1971), leading to the world- famous event of “Green Revolution”. This had a great impact on income of farming community in India. Since then, many varieties such as, first flood tolerant rice variety Swarna-Sub 1, Groundnut variety ICGV 91114, pigeon pea cultivar ICPH, pearl millet early maturing hybrid HHB, cassava Table 3: Status of Germplasm Exchange with CGIAR Institutions: Import – [1976-2019] CG Institute Number of accessions Crop(s) IRRI, Philippines 1,23,253 Paddy CIMMYT, Mexico 61,742 Wheat, Maize, Barley ICARDA, Syria 25,853 Wheat, barley, lentil, chickpea, IITA, Nigeria 7,628 Cowpea, soybean, cassava, maize ICRISAT, Niger 6,708 Pearl millet, sorghum, pigeonpea, chickpea, groundnut, small millets CIAT, Columbia 1986 French bean, forage legumes and grasses CIP, Peru 3668 Potato, sweet potato Bioversity (INIBAP), Belgium 433 Banana Total 2,31,271 Note: Additionally, a total of 27,79,878 samples of nurseries/ trials are received CG Consortium Centres for multi-location evaluation and testing Table 4: Status of Germplasm Exchange with CGIAR Institutions: Export – [1976-2019] CG Institute Number of samples Crops IRRI, Philippines 1,612 Paddy CIMMYT, Mexico (Collaborating institutes in different countries) 42,243 Maize, Wheat, Barley ICARDA, Syria, Morocco 92 Chickpea, barley INIBAP, Belgium 58 Banana Total 44,005 Note: Additionally, a total of 7,41,485 samples of ICRISAT mandate crops were quarantined and facilitated for export to its collaborating centers through Reginal Station, Hyderabad varieties Sree Padamnabha, etc have been released in the country. Highlights of CGIAR contribution to Indian Agriculture yy With ICRISAT, the NARS developed about 316 improved varieties/hybrids which include sorghum (41), pearlmillet (170), chickpea (45), pigeonpea (29) and groundnut (31). With collaboration and support from ICRISAT, the NARS released the first set of genomics- assisted breeding varieties for drought tolerance and fusarium wilt resistance in chickpea. The pigeon pea cultivar ICPH and pearl millet early maturing hybrid HHB67 in Rajasthan yielded significantly higher, covered greater area and provided more financial benefit to the farmers. ICAR-CGIAR | ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 4 yy IRRI enabled the development of the first flood tolerant rice variety, Swarna-Sub 1 and several high yielding rice varieties which are tolerant to biotic and abiotic stresses suited to various environments, hybrid rice, stress proof rice (tolerant to flash flood, stagnant flood, drought and salinity etc.) yy Many wheat varieties comprising of durum and bread wheat have been released in the country possessing CIMMYT parentage. yy Collaboration with ICARDA resulted into development of 15 lentil varieties and the work on Fe and Zn rich varieties for short season environment is in progress.
