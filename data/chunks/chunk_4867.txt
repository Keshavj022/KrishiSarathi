 This efficient use of water helps to alleviate drought stress while conserving limited natural resources. In controlled greenhouse environments, automated systems regulate the temperature, humidity, and light based on sensor feedback. When temperature sensors detect heat stress, cooling systems can be activated to maintain the optimal growth conditions. Automated shading and ventilation systems further protect crops from heat stress and excessive sunlight exposure. These systems ensure consistent growing conditions, reduce resource consumption, and improve crop quality by utilizing IoT sensors and software to monitor and adjust the environment in real-time.

They can automate environmental controls, activate misting systems during high heat, or provide ventilation during extreme humidity, helping maintain optimal conditions. Moreover, drones enhance the precision of nutrient and water application. Studies have shown that drone-facilitated foliar application of micronutrients significantly improves growth and yield compared with traditional methods. Drones quickly scan large areas, identify zones requiring immediate intervention, and efficiently allocate resources to areas experiencing higher stress levels. SUMMARY Digital technologies offer significant potential for the assessment and mitigation of abiotic stresses in horticultural crops. These tools provide precise real-time data on plant health and environmental conditions, allowing for early stress detection and targeted interventions. By utilizing remote sensing, IoT sensors, AI, and decision support systems, farmers can implement timely and precise strategies to mitigate the effects of drought, heat, salinity, and other stress factors.
