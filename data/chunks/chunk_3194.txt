0 CS2 μg g‐1 at Anand and Jaipur and below detectable limit at the other two locations. The residues were not detected in soil samples at harvest at any of the four locations. Supervised trial of Tricontanol on potato was carried out at four centers viz. Anand, Kalyani, Solan and Ludhiana at two dosages i.e. 0.25 g a.i. /ha and 0.5 g a.i. /ha. Residues of tricontanol in potato tubers as well as soil at the time of harvest were Below Detectable limits (BDL) at all the four locations. Spinosad (45 % SC) persistence on red gram was carried out at Rahuri, Anand, Kalyani and Hyderabad centers at two dosage i.e. 73.0 and 146.0 g a.i. /ha. Spinosad residues in red gram as well as soil at harvest were below detectable limit at all the locations. • The persistence of a number of pesticides was studied on apple crop by Solan center at four different locations of Himachal Pradesh, India viz. Solan, Mashobra, Matiana and Thanedhar. Spiromesifen was sprayed at two dosage i.e. 120 g a.i. /ha and 240 g a.i. /ha. The half‐life of spiromesifen was found 5.47‐6.24 days at the recommended dose. Bifenthrin (Brigade)® persistence was studied at 60.0 g a.i. /ha and 120.0 g a.i. /ha dosage. www.icar.org.in 71 2002 ‐ 2007 Bifenthrin residues in apple fruits were below detectable limit at harvest i.e. 30 days after spray. Fenazaquin (Magister)® was sprayed in triplicate plot in two dosages i.e. 40 g a.i. /ha and 80 g a.i. /ha. Initial deposits of fenazaquin on apple fruits were 0.432‐0.564 and 0.998‐ 1.064 mg/kg due to application of 40 g a.i./ha and 80 g a.i./ha, which dissipate to below detectable limit in 30 days. Diniconazole (Sumi‐8®, 25 WP) was applied at 500 and 1000 g a.i./ha dosages. Initial deposits of diniconazole on apple fruits were 0.55‐1.34 mg/kg, which dissipate to below detectable limit in 30 days. The persistence and residues of imidacloprid was determined at two dosages 890 and 1780 g a.i. /ha. The residues of imidacloprid (Confidor 200 SL) become non‐detectable on 30th days of sampling. Supervised trial of Fenpropathrin (Meothrin 30 EC) was carried out at 450 g a.i. /ha and 900 g a.i. /ha. Fenpropathrin residues in apple fruits and soil were non detectable at 30th day after spray. • Supervised trial of Imidacloprid on cotton was carried out at college farm of Hyderabad center. The pesticide was applied twice first 60 days after sowing and then 75 DAS at two application rate i.e. 35 g ha‐1 and 70 g ha‐1. None of the sample (soil, lint and seed) showed presence of imidacloprid residues in all treatments. Mixed formulation of acephate 50 % and imidacloprid 1.8 % SP (Lancer Gold)® on Cotton was evaluated at experimental field of PAU, Ludhiana. Residues of acephate dissipated to below detectable limit of 0.02 mg kg‐1 after 15 days of its application and that of imidacloprid below detectable limit of 0.02 mg kg‐1 after 7 days of application.
