 It possesses 19% tuber dry-matter and has tolerance to mite and hopper burn, which are the primary insect- pests during early-season crops. It has been identified for Utter Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand (early crop planting) Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Odisha (main crop planting). Therefore, this variety is recommended for potato production as the early crop in northern plains of India and as the main crop in central blainsh and plateau regions. WS/07-113 has been identified as a climate resilient variety with field tolerance to less soil moisture stress and recommended for cultivation in Central and Eastern plains of India. It has white cream ovoid tubers with cream flesh. The productivity of this variety is 32 t/ha under water stress conditions. The clone is medium maturating (90-100 days). Tannia: TTn 14-1 (IGSGTN 1) has 30% higher (12.16 t/ha) productivity than the local check (8.7 t/ha) and identified for cultivation in Chhattisgarh, Manipur and Kerala. TTn 14-5 (XaMTS Local) has 39% higher (14 t/ ha) productivity than the local check (10.08 t/ha) and identified for cultivation in Kerala. Taro: BCST 14 recorded 21.56% higher (19.34 t/ ha) stolon yield than the local check (15.17 t/ha) and recommended for cultivation in West Bengal, Assam and Manipur. AAUST 2 recorded 33.73% higher (26.97 t/ha) caudex yield than the local check (20.04 t/ha) and recommended for state release in Assam. Spices Small cardamom: Appangala 3 is a moisture stress tolerant cardamom genotype with 550 kg dry capsules/ha productivity under irrigated, conditions and 360 kg dry capsules/ha under moisture stress conditions. The 50% of the capsules are of > 8 mm size. Essential oil content varies from 8.74% (irrigated, conditions) to 8.84% (moisture stress conditions). Drought susceptibility Harvested stolons for marketing (BCST 14) Corms and cormels of tannia variety IGSGTN-1 Crop Improvement icar annual report 2022-23 62 index is 0.89 and drought tolerance efficiency is 70.71%. There is not much change in the composition of Î±-terpinyl acetate and 1,8 cineole under irrigated, and moisture stress conditions. Fennel: JF 2013-19 (GF 13) is high yielding (21.12 q/ha), which is 14.8 and 10.7 per cent higher seed yield over National checks, viz. RF 205 and RF 101, respectively. It contains high volatile oil yield (40.75 l/ ha) withbold seed (test weight 6.33g). It is moderately resistant to Ramularia blight disease. assembly covered more than 98% of the estimated size (352.54 Mb) of the pomegranate genome. The LTR Assembly Index (LAI) value of 10 and 93.68% BUSCO completeness score over the 1440 ortholog genes of the finished pomegranate genome displays the quality of the assembled pomegranate genome. Further, 29,435 number of gene models were discovered with a mean transcript length of 2954bp and a mean coding sequence length of 1090 bp.
