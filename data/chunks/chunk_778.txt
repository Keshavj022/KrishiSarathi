High soil pH drastically reduces zinc availability. Intensive cereal cropping over years also leads to zinc deficiency. The symptoms appear on the second or third leaf from top, at about 2 to 3 weeks after transplanting. Rice leaves develop brown blotches and streaks that may fuse to cover older leaves. Zinc deficiency for prolonged period reduces plant height, tillering and grain yield and in severe cases plants die. Regular consumption of low zinc rice induces stunted growth, improper development, low intelligence and diseases due to low immunity. Zinc deficiency in rice plant can be managed by fertilizer application, water management, soil amendment, crop diversification and organic matter application. Water soluble zinc sulphate can be sprayed on leaves, and zinc oxide can be administered as a root dip for seedlings. Due to its acid-forming properties and abundant sulphur, zinc sulphate is the best solution for sodic soil. To prevent initial loss, zinc fertilizer should be administered early. Foliar treatment throughout boot leaf to blooming is desired to obtain zinc-rich grain or seed.

About 3.5 billion people depend on rice for 20% of their calorie intake. Approximately 84% of total rice production is used as human food while 64% for wheat and mere 14% for maize. In high rainfall regions of Asia, rice crop account 90% of the food grain production and consumption. Rice is usually grown in areas with dense population. To produce more grain, application rates of nitrogen, phosphorous and potash has been increased led to decline in soil fertility and organic matter with an increase in secondary and micronutrient deficiency.
