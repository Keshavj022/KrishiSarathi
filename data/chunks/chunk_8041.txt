 The system was implemented at IARI, New Delhi along with its outreach programs, and CIFE, Mumbai. System was made operational for IVRI, Izatnagar (http://amsivri.icar.gov.in/) and NDRI, Karnal (http://amsndri.icar.gov.in/). System implementation was initiated for CAU, Imphal. ICAR-Personal management information system (PMIS): PMIS, a workflow based system is developed for managing the various scientific cadres, transfer process with real time tracking of transfer applications, posting of newly appointed scientists in a transparent Level and intensity of agricultural research funding in India, triennium averages 1981-83 1991-93 2001-03 2012-14 Research and 14,003 24,697 44,669 86,682 education funding, 2011 million ` Research funding, 594 1,034 1,905 3,533 2011 million PPP dollars Research intensity 0.25 0.31 0.39 0.40 (funding as percentage of AgGDP) Research impact in the rice-wheat system: Impact of recent technological interventions in the rice wheat system was assessed using the economic surplus method. The aggregate gross economic benefits from all the technologies were compared with the research cost for computation of the net benefits. All the technological interventions likely to generate economic benefits (net present value) worth ` 190.8 billion over 20 years at 2014 prices. More than three-fourths of the aggregate benefits were generated by wheat and common rice varieties due to their larger adoption, and most of the aggregate benefits likely shared by the consumers. The estimated internal rate of return is 38.80% and the ratio of net benefits to the cost is 17.31. These estimates of economic benefits are slightly lower than the median rate of return (IRR 53%) reported for India in the past for the green revolution technologies, but quite comparable to the rate of returns (IRR about 40%) from technological interventions under the National Agricultural Innovation Project. Our estimates are comparable to those obtained for CGIAR research; estimated B-C ratio for system-wide research was 4.76 for the period 1960-2001, which improved to 17.26 when the benefits were extrapolated through 2011. The estimated internal rate of return was 34 %. Statistics and Computer Application ICAR Data Centre Shri Radha Mohan Singh, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, inaugurated the ICAR Data Centre and launched the KVK Mobile App at ICAR-Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute, New Delhi. ICAR Data Centre provides the ICT infrastructure for hosting the web applications developed by ICAR Institutes; the unified messaging solution which is based on Microsoft Exchange Server, which helps ICAR personnel to stay connected with each other via instant messaging, email, audio/video calls, persistent chat rooms, online meeting and presentations for scientific/research/technological/ educational/ extension information exchange; uniform email IDs (https://mail.icar.gov.
