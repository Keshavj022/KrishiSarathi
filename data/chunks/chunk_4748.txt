 CISH- Bael-1 has very good taste and flavour which is again a positive trait for processing industry. Fruits pulp recovery is quite high with about 65.57% pulp content having TSS of (38.0oB), total carotenoids (1.18 mg/100 g pulp), total sugar (20.54%), tannin content (3.5%), marmelosin (596.57 μg g), psoralen (102.02 μg g), aurapten (53.23 μg g) and polyphenols (3.66%), ascorbic acid (79.00 μg g), riboflavin (158 μg g), thiamine (233 μg g) and niacin (1340.00 μg g) of this variety depicts a very high nutritive and therapeutic value. The yield of fully grown up trees (10-12 years) of CISH- Bael-1 varies from 50-80 kg/tree. The fruits are also suitable for processing into number of nutritive and medicinal products such as squash, nectar, leather, pulp, powder and jam. Crop husbandry Bael has wide adaptability for soil and climatic conditions in subtropical region. It can be grown up to an elevation of 1,200 m and tolerates low (7oC) as well as high (48ºC) temperatures. All type of soils are recommended for its cultivation, however, sandy loam soil with proper drainage is considered ideal. Soil with pH 6.0-8.5, sodicity up to 30 ESP and salinity up to 9 dsm-1 EC is also suited for its cultivation. It is considered as one of the scavenger plant for problematic soils, due to it xerophytic characters. Research Plants are commonly raised by seeds, which are sown in 15-20 cm raised beds of 1 × 5 m size at 1-2 cm depth just after their extraction in the month of June. Seeds germinate within three weeks. The seedling are then shifted and transplanted in the field after seven weeks of sowing. These seedlings are ready for budding/ grafting after one year. Generally, plants are prepared commercially by budding and grafting, but sometimes plants are also raised from root suckers. Among different methods of propagation, patch budding gives 80-90% success, when performed in the month of June-July. In situ orchard establishment In the wasteland and areas having water scarcity, in situ orchard establishment can be advocated. As per layout plan, two bael seeds are sown in a pit refilled as stated earlier or seedlings grown in polythene bag should be planted during June-July. Desired cultivar is budded on these seedlings during June-July in the following year. Pit of one cubic meter size are dug at a distance of 8 × 8 m two months prior to planting (April-May). About, 30-40 kg of well-rotted FYM and one kg of neem cake or 0.5 kg bone meal are mixed in top 50% soil of each pit. The pit is filled first with unmixed soil and then with mixed soil. In sodic soil, 5-8 kg gypsum along with 20 Table 1.
