76 kg dry beans at the age of seven years followed by genotypes VTLCH 2, VTLC 11 and VTLC 5 . Horticultural Research Station (HRS) (ICAR-AICRP on Palms & Cocoa), Kahikuchi, Assam: At HRS, 16 cocoa genotypes were evaluated under coconut from 2015 onwards. Among them, VTLC 20 recorded a significantly higher dry bean yield of 2.2 kg per tree per year followed by VTLC 18 (1.5 kg/tree/year) and eight clones yielded more than 1.0 kg dry beans at the age of six years. ICAR-CPCRI, Research Centre, Mohitnagar, Jalpaiguri, West Bengal: At Mohitnagar, MLT on cocoa is running from 2015 onwards and the performance of different cocoa genotypes is depicted in the figure below. Among the 14 cocoa genotypes, the performance of VTLC 5 VTLCC 11, VTLCH 1 and VTLC 5 is better and is on par in terms of dry bean yield/ tree/ year under arecanut garden, however, the performance of VTLCH 4, VTLC 5, VTLC 11 and VTLCH 1 was better under coconut (ICAR-CPCRI, 2022). All the above trials showed the potential of cocoa in the region for long term sustainable palm based cropping system models. Front Line Demonstration (FLD) gardens are already established in MGMG villages by the centres with DCCD funds. These parental clones and hybrids can be assembled both as bi-clonal and poly-clonal orchards in nearby ICAR institutes, KVK’s and State Agricultural Universities will enhance the supply of quality planting materials for the region. This offers a great opportunity for NE region to be an upcoming cocoa hub in the near future. Recommended cropping systems (i) Mixed Crop Under Palms: Under Arecanut: Arecanut spacing 2.7 × 2.7 m, cocoa in centre of four areca palms at 2.7 × 5.4 m (9 × 18 ft) normal spacing, 686 plants/ ha. KHIC 21 KHIC 26 VTLC 19 DDG (Hort.) at ICAR-CPCRI Kahikuchi Cocoa Plot centres in the region with DCCD funding. y National research institute, ICAR-CPCRI, developmental agency, DCCD and the chocolate industry, farmers co-operative CAMPCO will support the sustainability of cocoa in the region. y Since GOI specifically allotted NE funds for research and development, it will definitely have an impact on cocoa sector as well in the region. y Monopoly of cocoa industry in India was minimized with the involvement of multiple chocolate industries like Mars, Mondelez (Ex. Cadbury), CAMPCO, Nestle, Amul, Jindal, etc., in the marketing. Cocoa varieties for the region ICAR-CPCRI, Research Centre, Kahikuchi, Guwahati, Assam: Based on the growth, pod yield and bean traits, KHIC 21, KHIC 13 and KHIC 26 are found to be good November–December 2023 87 2.7 × 2.7 m high density, 5.4 × 5.4 m wide spacing, 3 × 3 m new garden with same time planting of arecanut and cocoa and arecanut based multi species cropping system- Areca + Cocoa + Banana + Pepper. Under Coconut: Coconut spacing 7.5 × 7.5 m Single hedge cocoa 2.5-3 × 7.5 m, 3 × 7.5 m (10 × 25 ft)= 444 trees/ ha. Double hedge cocoa 2.5-3 m square/ triangle, 2.5-2.
