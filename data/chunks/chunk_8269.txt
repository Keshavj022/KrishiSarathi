 The data were employed to fix maximum residue limit (MRL) for eight pesticide-crop combinations by the Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), while their safe waiting period and Insect-gut microflora degraded pesticide Experimental analysis proved that gut microflora of insect-pests degraded pesticides. LC-MS analysis confirmed the ability of Bacillus pumilus degrading insecticide Imidacloprid, isolated from the gut of Amrasca biguttula biguttula. Imidacloprid (209.91) was degraded into Imidacloprid guanidine (175.06), chemical molecule comparatively less toxic to Indian cotton jassid. Decreased area of the spectrum indicates degradation of the compound CROP MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 69 Enhancing productivity of pigeonpea: Experiment on the efficiency of pollinators in enhancing productivity of pigeonpea at Nagaland on the basis of number of pollens deposited per visit, viability of pollen-grains and their visitation rate indicated that five species of insects — Megachile lanata, M. relata, M. monticola, M. conjuncta and Xylocopa tenuiscapa —were true insect pollinators of pigeonpea. M. lanata was the most efficient pollinator. There was 13.4% yield increase in open pollination over pollinator exclusion, showing significant role of pollinators in increasing pigeonpea yield. Selective breeding of Apis mellifera through artificial insemination of the queen Artificial Insemination of queens was carried out during February- March’2016. Comparative performance of Artificially Inseminated (AI) Queens was found superior compared to Naturally Inseminated (NI) ones. The colony performance index in terms of brood area, pollen and nectar area was maximum in artificially infested queens during the fourth week of March(3880.82±0.08, 3100.64±1.59, 2450.17±1.78 and 2305.56±3.16sq cm) against NI (2810.52±2.12, 2400.20±0.51, 2250.07±0.79 and 2200.21±2.17sq cm).

The colonies of B. haemorrhoidalis having 10-25 worker-bees when shifted from incubator to field, survived one complete cycle. These colonies produced more queens and survived till December like natural ones. This is for the first time, B. haemorrhoidalis colonies were reared around the year in India. The daughter queens, which were mated during October and then maintained under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity, reared brood successfully during winter (January-February) without undergoing hibernation. Productivity enhancement in cherry: Exclusive bee polination with Apis mellifera in cherry-orchards at solan at one colony per hectare resulted in fruit-set of 70.95% compared to 70.35 and 63.47% in hand pollination and open pollination, respectively.
