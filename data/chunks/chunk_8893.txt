 Air layering was successfully done during March-October which provide sufficient time for producing air layered plants which can be used to establish seed orchards The studies conducted on vegetative propagation of bamboo at Nagpur revealed that cuttings taken from basal portion of bamboo culms were best in rooting ability with NAA 100 ppm treatment (83.33%). Vegetative propagation studies in 5 and 25 year old Acacia lenticularis plants at Pusa, showed that rooting potential of stem cuttings varied with season. In young trees the maximum rooting was recorded during February with IBA 100 ppm (78%) followed by June plantation with IBA 200 ppm (71% rooting). Growth Model In order to develop stand yield/growth model, biomass-dbh model has been developed for Eucalyptus tereticornis clones to be used for non-destructive estimations of above ground biomass. The fitted model resulted in Biomass=1060.22*[1+exp(3.62-0.09*dbh)]-1 with R2 (obs vs pred)=0.994 The proposed model predicted reasonable future biomass growth values with mean 12.5% bias, mean residual of 0.396 kg and absolute mean residual as 15.426 kg with t-test value of -0.134 with p-value= 0.894 ensuring the accuracy of prediction. Agrisilvicultural System Studies conducted at Jhansi revealed that under agrisilvicultural system with Tectona grandis, Azadirachta indica and Albizia procera the minimum reduction in intercrop yield (with and without pruning) was recorded in association with T. grandis (11.57 and 23.66% in wheat and 18.75 and 28.13% in blackgram) and maximum under A. procera (30.99 and 34.50% in wheat and 43.75 and 46.88% in blackgram) over control (3.275 and 0.320 tonnes/ha), respectively. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001â€“2002 86 ECONOMICS OF AGRISILVICULTURE - A NEW LAND USE SYSTEM The teak based agrisilvicultural system developed at Dharwad, revealed that addition of teak and papaya in the system resulted in higher net return (Rs 15,607/ ha/year) followed by field crop + teak + papaya + grass (Rs 14,156/ha/year) least being in sole crops. In another system, at the end of 10th year, soybean grain yield was significantly reduced at 1 m and 5 m distance from the tree base of different species compared to sole crop. The lowest reduction was observed with Prosopis cineraria (37.9%) and highest with Terminalia belarica (66.42%). In a boundary plantation system of Dendrocalamus strictus developed at Pusa, turmeric, ginger and Dinanath grass produced 32.4 to 40.5% relative yield under full light (0% interception) indicating higher yield near the bamboo row compared to away from bamboo. In Casuarina equisetifolia based agri- silvicultural system at Faizabad, there was a significant effect of 50% pruning of tree canopy on crop yield. The reduction in crop yield over control was (15.3 and 16.6%, respectively for wheat and rice), whereas reduction was 35% and 32%, respectively for wheat and rice under unpruned conditions.
