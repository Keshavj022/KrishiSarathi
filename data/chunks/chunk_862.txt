It has been reported that eDNA approach could be more sensitive than conventional pheromone and black light traps in the detection of the BMSB. The eDNA is collected from the surface of the fruit and if the BMSB visits the host plant, then the eDNA is deposited and it can be detected. Also, the eDNA approach has revolutionized the agricultural pest surveillance, e.g. water sampling from the paddy field can tell all the species present in the farm and species composition of the farm can be used to predict the type of pests and the management practices to be taken. Electronic nose: Electronic nose (e-nose) is the device designed to sense a very low concentration of volatile compounds emanating from the living organism. Plants release volatile compounds in response to an infestation with a pest. The sensors of the e-noses are made of synthetic materials such as metal- oxide-semiconductor, conducting polymers, polymer composites, mass spectrometers, etc. In invasion science, it could be used for the detection of hidden pests in food grain consignment or to detect a pest. The Emrald ash borer (EAB), introduced to the United States in the early 1990s became invasive and the production of ash trees became challenging for the government. The damage symptoms were visible only when the survival of tree was questionable. Then, USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) developed an e-nose which can detect EAB whose larvae tunnel is under sapwood and identify them before the symptoms appear, preventing tree death and damage. Use of acoustics for the detection of hidden infestation: The hidden infestations of wood boring insects are not visible externally.
