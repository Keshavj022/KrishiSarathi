 A robust framework of 85 training programs has been established to educate and empower individuals with the latest technological knowledge. Additionally, 24 field days serve as interactive platforms for practical learning and hands-on experiences. Exhibitions (23), provide a public showcase for cutting-edge technologies. The dissemination strategy extends to the airwaves with 10 radio programs and 18 television programs, reaching a wider audience. Print media is leveraged through 50 publications, while 20,000 leaflets are distributed to further enhance awareness. A CD has been prepared as a comprehensive resource, complemented by 26 mobile messages for timely updates. Furthermore, the organization actively participates in the sale of 200 quintals of BSMR-736 seeds under a revolving fund. In synergy, these initiatives form a cohesive strategy to bridge the technological gap, further augmented by the inclusion of the university calendar. March 2024 83 Indian Farming 84 March 2024 Horizontal spread of redgram transplanting technology The horizontal spread of transplanting technology in redgram in Karnataka has witnessed significant expansion, encompassing a vast area of 2,000 ha in Bidar district. This innovative agricultural practice has not only taken root in Bidar but has also proliferated into neighbouring districts such as Kalaburgi, Koppal, Yadgir, Raichur, Vijayapur, Bagalkot, Haveri, Chickmagaluru, and beyond the state borders into Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Tamil Nadu. The adoption of transplanting technology has become a catalyst for agricultural advancement, contributing to increased productivity and sustainable farming practices across a diverse geographical landscape. Recognizing the potential of transplanting technology, redgram farmers in the district have formed associations, envisioning the export of processed dal to neighbouring states and even venturing into international markets. Embracing this cutting-edge technology has positively transformed the living standards of redgram farmers, turning Bidar into the pulse bowl of Karnataka and a symbol of progress and prosperity in agriculture. The district is now witnessing the establishment of numerous redgram processing units thereby creating substantial employment opportunities. SUMMARY Redgram is one of the most important commercial crops for dryland farmers in Bidar district of Karnataka. Traditional cultivation practices, improper sowing time, inadequate plant population, defective method of sowing, inadequate intercultural operations, inadequate use of phosphatic fertilizers and improper method of application are the major agronomic constraints due to which productivity is declining. In this regard, ICAR-KVK, Bidar initiated a trial on transplanting of Redgram after a collaborative discussion and brainstorming session with progressive farmers and ICAR-KVK scientists in 2004-05 that led to achieving promising results.
