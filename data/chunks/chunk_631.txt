 These fibres possess exceptional strength, durability, and lustre, making them highly sought after in the textile industry. The fibres are used to produce linen fabrics, which are valued for their coolness, breathability, and ability to withstand frequent laundering. Sustainability and environ- mental friendliness: Fibre flax is a sustainable and eco-friendly crop. It requires fewer pesticides and fertilizers compared to other fibre crops like cotton. Flax plants have a relatively short growth cycle, reducing the need for excessive water consumption. Hypoallergenic and anti-bacterial properties: Linen fabrics derived from fibre flax have hypoallergenic properties, making them suitable for individuals with sensitive skin or allergies. Linenâ€™s natural fibres are resistant to dust mites and mould, and possess natural anti-bacterial properties, providing a cleaner and healthier sleeping environment. Strength and durability: Fibre flax fibres are known for their strength and durability, making linen fabrics long-lasting and resistant to wear and tear. Linen garments can withstand frequent washing and have a higher resistance to pilling compared to other fabrics. This durability ensures that linen products have a longer lifespan, reducing the need for frequent replacements. Versatility in textile applications: Fibre flax offers versatility in textile applications beyond clothing. Linen fabrics derived from flax are used in home textiles such as bed sheets, towels, table cloths, and upholstery. Thermal and moisture regulation: Linen fabrics made from fibre flax possess excellent thermal regulation properties. They keep the body cool in hot weather by allowing heat to dissipate, while also providing insulation in colder temperatures. Linen fabrics are highly absorbent, capable of absorbing and releasing moisture rapidly, making them ideal for summer clothing and bedding. Future perspective The synchronization of fibre and seed maturation poses a scientific and possibly industrial challenges for flax. It is generally known that for both the fibrous and linseed plant varieties, stem maturation and seed maturation are independent processes. When the secondary phloem fibre cells have fully developed and the stems have almost completely defoliated, fibrous flax is ready to be harvested. Flax now offers good fibre output and quality. However, harvesting the plant at this stage puts the quality of the planting seed in danger. On the other side, harvesting at a later time Linseed plant, seeds and oil Source: https://www.chemarc.com/bizhub/pranavagro/wesell/14137756307055183 Indian Farming 25 July 2023 results in increased lignification and worse fibre quality. Thus, more fruitful harvesting will result from more synchronised maturity of stem fibres and seeds.
