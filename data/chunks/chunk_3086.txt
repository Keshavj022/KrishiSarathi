The organic + inorganic nutrient application was in general found beneficial. • Application of micronutrients along with recommended fertilizers improved the seed germination and vigor index. 3.5 Rain water management • Estimated Annual Runoff was determined using the FAO method for potential water harvesting and projective for possible sites of farm ponds in GIC environment • Components of watershed and prioritization based on rainfall. The components were prioritized for rainfall based agro climatic zones. • Prioritized rainfall based Soil & Water Conservation measures Soil & water conservation measures have been prioritized for various rainfall and land capability classes. • Impact assessment of some successful Soil and Water Conservation interventions at various centers has been carried out. 3.6 Energy Management • Developed hand operated weeder, twin wheel hoe at Arjia, cycle hoe, 6 row animal drawn gorru at Anantapur, two‐bowl ferti‐cum‐seed drill, two row seed drill at Arjia, Arjia Power weeder, modification of ridger seeder at Hisar, crop collection unit attached to ANGRAU‐ blade guntaka at Anantapur, Tractor mounted Reaper for Fingemillet harvesting at Bangalore, Tractor Drawn Intercultural Operation at Bangalore, Tractor drawn Digger for harvesting Groundnut at Bangalore, Cage Wheels at Anantapur, Rotavator in Arjia, Reduced Tillage in Drylands is more adoptable in low or high rainfall regions etc. were developed. 3.7 Diversified farming systems • 43 diversified farming systems developed by various centers have been described • A nomogram was prepared for identification of a productive farming system based on rainfall, soil and land capability. Rainfed Farming Systems Modules‐for location specific assessment and refinement in various agro‐eco‐sub regions in various crop based production systems were developed. www.icar.org.in 38 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Natural Resource Management 3.8 Technologies validated and practiced Varieties • Curcumin rich high yielding turmeric varieties ‘Sudersan’ (200 days), ‘Suguna’ (200 days) and ‘Subarna’ (200 days) were for prosperous tribal life in Kandhamal district of Orissa. A total of 709 ha were brought under quality turmeric involving 61 Spices Development Societies and 12000 farmers in 5 blocks of the district.
