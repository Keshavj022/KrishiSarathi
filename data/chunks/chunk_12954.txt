 It is a good keeper under country Peru, while the male parent is from an earlier breeding programme involving in its parentage an Indian variety Kufri Red and the variety Navajo from USA. The variety produces white-cream round tuber with medium eyes and cream flesh. The variety produces nearly 30-32 t/ha yield under north Indian plains of the country. The tubers of this variety have reducing sugars in the tune of 30-100 mg/ 100 g fresh weight and dry matter content is 22- 24%. The variety has high degree of late blight resistance. The processing grade percentage is 65-75 and is highly suitable for chip making. Kufri Chipsona-3 (MP/97-583) The variety is a selection from the progeny of the cross MP/91-86 × Kufri Chipsona-2. The female parent MP/91-86 is a promising selection from the processing breeding programme. The variety produces white-cream ovoid tuber with shallow eyes and white flesh. The variety produces nearly 30-35 t/ha yield under north Indian plains of the country. The tubers of this variety have reducing sugar content of 10-100 mg/100 g fresh weight and dry matter content is 20-23%.The variety has moderate resistance to late blight and is suitable for chips and flakes preparation. The variety yields reasonably good process grade tubers to the tune of 70-80%. Kufri Himsona (MP/97-644) The variety is a selection from the progeny of the cross MP/92-35 × Kufri Chipsona-2. The female parent MP/92-35 is a selection from processing breeding programme. The variety produces white-cream ovoid tuber with shallow eyes and white flesh. The variety produces nearly 15-20 t/ha yield under hilly regions of the country. Indigenous potato processing varieties developed by CPRI Indian Horticulture 14 store conditions and possess longer tuber dormancy period of more than 8 weeks. It possesses high tuber dry matter (22%), low reducing sugars (30-80 mg/100 g fresh weight) and very good quality French fries can be prepared. The industrial testing has shown the superiority of this hybrid for French fry making in terms of taste, texture and colour. Kufri FryoM (MP/04-578) The variety is selection from the progeny of Kufri Chipsona-1 × MP/92-35. It produces attractive white long oblong tubers with shallow eyes and white flesh. The variety produces nearly 30-35 t/ha tuber yield in plains of the country. Tubers do not show deformities like cracking or hollow heart. It has field resistance against late blight disease. It is a good keeper under country store conditions and possess longer tuber dormancy period of more than 10 weeks. It possesses 20% tuber dry matter, low reducing sugars (50-90 mg/100 g fresh weight) and very good quality French fries can be prepared. Future thrusts In India, processing is in developing phase as compared to USA, Canada and Europe, where 30-67% of produce is processed into various products.
