 Of the total samples screened, 1625 buffalo serum samples from 9 states (Sikkim, Mizoram, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Uttarakhand) 3.63% were positive for brucellosis. The sero-diagnostic services were provided for Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), trypanosomiasis and pasteurellosis with 28.9%, 49% and 4.5% positivity, respectively, in ruminants. A total of 795 samples comprising serum, urine, and blood (human-468, goat-81, cattle-73 and buffalo-173) from Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu were tested by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), of which, 56 (human- 36, goat- 3, cattle- 9 and buffalo-8) serum samples showed positive reactivity against different Leptospira serovars. Post vaccination sero-monitoring: Brucella post Buffalo Calves Produced from Semen of the Cloned Bulls Twenty female buffaloes were inseminated with the semen of two cloned bulls. Following insemination, a 65% conception rate was achieved, which is normal in buffaloes. Thirteen healthy calves (seven males and six females) were produced. These calves are physiologically normal, growing well and healthy. The technology will lead to future sustainable milk production in the country. Calves produced from semen of cloned bulls namely Swarn and Rajat (August-December 2021) Physiology Prototype of intra-vaginal wireless sensor device: Prototype of intra-vaginal wireless sensor device was developed for remote monitoring of calving process in dairy cows. This could help in predicting the calving time in cattle. Ready to use semen extender for buffalo semen: Semen dilution to 12 million sperm/dose did not affect the conception rate after AI in buffalo. Therefore, LDL- based extender could be used containing a smaller number of sperms to maximize the use of elite bulls. icar annual report 2022-23 112 vaccination sero-monitoring is one of the major activities to evaluate the impact of the control program. Towards this, a total of 14,611 sera collected from different states were screened, of which, 64.45% were positive for anti- brucella antibodies. Foot and mouth disease Sero-surveillance and sero-monitoring: Under FMD sero-surveillance, 98,185 bovine serum samples from around the country were analyzed to determine the prevalence of FMDV circulation/ recent past infection. Overall seropositivity was 16.6% which is higher than the previous yearâ€™s average of 13.8%. In addition, 14,061 serum samples from small ruminants and pigs were also screened. A total of 30,137 serum samples were examined to assess the efficiency of immunization. In addition, 8,183 serum samples received from various breeding bull stations and surrounding villages were also tested to assess the protection level. The institute provided the state FMD centers with three main test kits (3AB3 indirect DIVA ELISA for 1,75,583 samples, Solid Phase Competitive ELISA (SPCE) for 1,56,778 samples, and Sandwich ELISA for 3893 samples).
