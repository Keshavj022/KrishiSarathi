 Solanaceous vegetables The family Solanaceae, in addition to potato (Solanum tuberosum), provides several other vegetables (Table 1) like tomato, brinjal, chilli/ hot pepper and sweet pepper. Another example is the Indian eggplant, which is known for its unique shape and size. The Indian eggplant is small and round, and is typically used in curries and stews. It has a distinct, bitter flavour that sets it apart from other varieties of eggplant. Contribution from ICAR-I IVR, Varanasi: Promising Solanaceous germplasm from ICAR-IIVR, Varanasi registered as unique germplasm at ICAR- NBPGR, New Delhi are provided in Table 2. Legumenous vegetables Legume family, Fabaceae which includes pea, bean and cowpea provides highly nutritional vegetables rich in proteins, and amino acids neatly complementing to the cereals. Contributions from ICAR-IIVR, Varanasi: Six promising genotypes have been registered by the institute, as given here. Triple Podded Pea (VRP-500): This is the first genetic stock of garden pea registered with NBPGR (INGR15009) bearing triple pod on every node. This line was developed through hybridization between VRP-5 (single pod at each node and early in maturity) and PC-531 (double pods at each node and medium in maturity) followed by selection. First flower appears on 13th node and it takes 52 days to 50% Triple Podded Pea (VRP-500) Indian Horticulture 46 Table 1.
