In this crucial period, it was at once an obligation and opportunity for the Indian Council of Agricultural Research to be of service to the nation by contributing its scientific and technological input for the preparation of eco-region specific contingency plans. Some valuable lessons were also learnt in this context. For one thing the drought brought home to us very emphatically the need for efficient water use and its in-situ or ex-situ conservation. It also highlighted the criticality of research on optimizing the mileage obtainable from every unit of water and thus produce more from less water. The need for having sufficient availability of forage and fodder was similarly highlighted.
