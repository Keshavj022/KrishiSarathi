 over-mining of soil nutrients, decline in factor productivity, reduction in profitability, lowering of groundwater, soil salinization and resurgence of pest-diseases including weeds, diseases, and insects in majority of intensively cultivated cereal-based production systems. To overcome these problems, different cropping systems and resource management techniques were adopted by duly taking care of region-specific needs of crops and their cultivars. Various innovative alternative cropping systems have been identified and are listed in the Table 1. Sequential/ intercropping systems were both included in suggested multiple cropping system, along with several variant i.e. mixed cropping, relay cropping, alley cropping, parallel- multiple cropping, multi-story cropping. Sequential cropping with inclusion of non-conventional crops, short duration crop/cultivars and intensive input management practices are being observed as key factors in increasing the productivity of systems all over the country. Thus, adoption of proper diversification, improved production techniques offer a scope of achieving the better net income. Presently, an efficient alternative cropping systems have successfully been developed for different agro- climatic zones of the country to get the high productivity. The present mean productivity of most suited prevailing systems stood at 9.2 tonnes/ha across location, which can be increased further up to the extent of 22.4 tonnes/ha via demo of high productive systems. Weed management Crops, develop fast canopy and possess allelopathic properties generally impose an adverse impact on weeds infestation, therefore, can be adopted as weed management Table 1.
