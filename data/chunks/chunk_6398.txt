The genotype can set fruits at maximum temperatures above 40°C and night temperatures above 25°C IC646851 22159 Heat tolerant. The genotype can set fruits at maximum temperatures above 40°C and night temperatures above 25°C Carrot (Daucus carota) IC623137 and IC642958 22160 IC623137 (VRCAR-214) is a petaloid-CMS line of red carrot with better heterotic potential for root yield, uniformity & lycopene content. The CMS line α and its maintainer (IC642958; Kashi Arun) are synchronous in flowering/ pollination. The roots of VRCAR-214 are good source of lycopene (7.3-7.5 mg/100g FW) and beta-carotene (3.25-3.50 mg/100g FW) Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia var. muricata) IC642345 22161 Resistant to powdery mildew (Podosphaera xanthii.
