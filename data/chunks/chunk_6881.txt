 Irrigation water pricing and crop diversification in Punjab: This study assessed the feasibility of a uniform water pricing policy and a differentiated water pricing policy wherein farmers growing less water requiring crops get an incentive for saving the water, while those growing water-intensive crops pay for it. The findings Growth in agriculture and allied activities (%) Period Crops Livestock Fisheries and aquaculture Forestry and logging Agricultural sector 1950–51 to 1960–61 3.0 3.0 5.6 0.5 2.8 1960–61 to 1970–71 1.9 1.8 3.9 3.2 2.0 1970–71 to 1980–81 2.1 2.0 2.7 -1.0 1.8 1980–81 to 1990–91 3.2 3.3 5.8 0.0 3.1 1990–91 to 2001–02 3.2 3.2 5.1 1.2 3.2 2001–02 to 2011–12 2.7 4.5 3.8 -0.6 2.7 2011–12 to 2019–20 1.5 7.5 8.6 3.5 3.5 Social Science Allied Activities - A Boost to Agricultural Growth In the recent decade, the agricultural sector has experienced all-time high growth of 3.5%, and the growth has been driven by the animal husbandry and fisheries. During 2011-12 to 2019-20, the livestock and fisheries sub-sectors grew at 7.5% and 8.6%, respectively, while the growth in crop sub-sector decelerated to 1.5%, from 2.7% during the previous decade. The demand for animal-source foods has been growing faster than plant-based foods, suggesting that Indian agriculture has been experiencing a demand-driven diversification, which is expected to continue in the future because of the sustained rise in per capita income and growing urbanization. To sustain the growth in allied agriculture, there is a strong need for greater technological, institutional and policy support. icar annual report 2022-23 161 instrument to regulate edible oil imports but not to boost oilseeds production. To this end, an improvement in technology shall contribute significantly. Opportunities also lie in exploiting the yield gaps. Statistical tools/Techniques Row-column designs with two rows: A general method of construction of row-column designs with two rows for orthogonal estimation of main effects and two factor interactions in minimum number of runs was given for orthogonal parameterization. A catalogue of efficient row-column designs for 2n (2 ≤ n ≤ 9) factorial in minimum number of replications was prepared. A general procedure of obtaining efficient w-optimal row-column designs in two rows for n-factors mixed level factorial experiments based on baseline parameterization was developed and a catalogue of w-optimal row- column designs in two rows for n-factors mixed level factorial experiment based on baseline parameterization was prepared. Linear trend free designs for factorial experiments: A general method of construction of multi-level factorial experiments that are linear trend- free for main effects and few lower order interaction effects was developed. Using this method, a series of 3n and 5n designs for complete factorial experiments that are linear trend-free for all the main effects were developed.
