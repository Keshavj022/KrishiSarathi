Sarma More information: Director, ICAR-Directorate of Coldwater Fisheries Research, Bhimtal, U.K. Email: director.dcfr@icar.gov.in Chocolate Mahseer Neolissochilus hexagonolepis (McClelland, 1839)  Chocolate mahseer, a highly esteemed food and game fish of Indian sub-continent and south-east Asia, is limited to north-eastern Himalaya in India, and is listed under threatened species.  The species is a batch spawner and breeds during January-February and May-September in flowing waters. Sexes are separate and distinguishable at maturity with male oozing milt on pressing the belly and females having bulged abdomen, pinkish vent and anal fin.  Captive broodstock of 600-800 g are raised in concrete tanks at stocking density of 2-3 nos/m2 and fed on formulated feed containing 30-40% protein.  Mass-breeding is achieved with administration of single injection of commercial hormone Ovaprim/Ovatide/Gonopro FH @ 0.2-0.3 ml/kg to male and @ 0.6 ml/kg body weight to female.  Stripping is done after 10-16 h of injection, when female shows signs of ovulation. Fecundity of the fish is very low, about 3,500 eggs/kg body weight.  Fertilized eggs are demersal having diameter of 2.0-2.5 mm. They are incubated in perforated hatching trays receiving oxygen rich water round the clock.  Hatching takes place within 50-60 h at 20-22°C. Yolk-sac is absorbed in 4-5 days and the length of free swimming larva is 8.4-8.6 mm.  Spawn is reared in closed re-circulatory tanks equipped with filtration system @ 2,000-3,000 spawn/m3 for about 15 days, fed on yolk suspension for 2-4 days and finally switched on to feed formulated wet diets until the fry stage.  The breeding technology has been promoted to north-eastern states. 18 Dark Mahseer Naziritor chelynoides (McClelland, 1839)  The Dark Mahseer inhabits fast-flowing cold mountain streams of Garhwal Himalayas and parts of Nepal. Potential candidate species for coldwater aquaculture for food and ornamental trade. It is a critically endangered fish species.  Sexes are separate. Batch spawner and lays eggs under the gravel. Male and female attain sexual maturity in aquarium and tanks with good management practices.  For captive breeding, aquarium and tanks are provided with a thick layer of gravel, continuous filtration of water and aeration. The fish constructs several pits in the gravel and bred naturally in November-December and March-April.  Fecundity is generally 800-1,000 eggs/female of 50-60 g. Fertilized eggs are pale yellow and non-adhesive having diameter of 2.0-2.5 mm.  Eggs are kept in floating trays in a closed re-circulatory incubation tank, which takes 60-70 h for hatching at 20-22°C.  Yolk-sac is absorbed in 2-3 days.
