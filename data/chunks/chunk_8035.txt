 horticulture and animal husbandry. Harnessing their potential would require improving farmers’ access to information on modern technologies and agricultural practices, and to institutional credit and remunerative markets. It is essential to improve complementarities of infrastructure and institutions as the lack of any one of these, may deprive farmers of the benefits of investments in others. Nonetheless, in the long-run sustainable improvements in farmers’ welfare will critically be determined by the pace of transfer of labour from agriculture to non-agricultural sectors. The implication is that if the constraints due to ubiquitous small-holdings were to be mitigated, strategies for broad-based growth of rural nonfarm sector would be required. not cover the sector as a whole owing to paucity of data and aggregation issues. The doubling of farmers’ income requires initial or benchmark set of estimates regarding the income which are to be doubled in a given time-frame. A Committee was constituted to provide the approach for estimation of farmers’ income in the country. The methodological approach for estimating the total household income are discussed here. The net farm income may be estimated from agriculture by deducting the paid-out labour cost, imputed value of family labour and rental value of land: This is equivalent to returns to family labour and fixed factors of production i.e. land. The net value added is computed by deducting the value of inputs such as seeds, organic manure, chemical fertilizers, current repairs and maintenance of fixed assets and other operational cost, feed of livestock, irrigation charges, market charges, electricity, pesticides and insecticides, diesel oil, financial intermediation services indirectly measured and consumption of fixed capital. It does not deduct the cost of paid-out human labour which is one of the important cost items. Thus the labour cost may be computed using the labour share in disaggregated studies. The farm income, thus derived needs to be adjusted for the non-farm income component. Computing the total household income: Situational assessment survey of NSSO provided the details of farmers’ income from farm as well as non-farm sources. Using this, the ratio between total household income and income from farm sector may be computed.
