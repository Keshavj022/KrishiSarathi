 Based on their index scores, 14 ACZs and 616 districts were categorized into different homogenous groups. The values of the estimated indices, did not reflect the absolute resilience, rather it only indicated the relative strength of ACZ/district to withstand climate risks. Overall high climate resilience was found in WCG, TGP, GPH and ECH. On the other hand, MGP (Bihar and parts of Uttar Pradesh) and EPH (primarily comprising Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha) had the lowest resilience. In addition, other zones namely, WDR, EHR and UGP were also categorized under lower degree of resilience to climate change. Most of the districts falling within the Gangetic Plains region and WDR had very low level of environmental resilience. Out of 89 districts lying in the EHR, about 67% had very high environmental resilience. Among the districts with very low to low level of technological resilience about 54% were concentrated in the EHR and EPH. Districts lying in the SPH had medium level of socio-economic resilience.

Overall, in CRA index among 124 districts with very low level of resilience, 66 districts were under north-eastern states forming part of EHR, 40 districts from EPH with maximum concentration from the states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh and 25 districts from MGP particularly from the state of Bihar. On the other hand, most of the districts in TGP and WCG showed very high resilience to manage climate risks.
