5% samples of groundwater were saline and alkali in nature, respectively. Similarly, 14.2 and 0.4% groundwater samples were found saline and alkali, respectively, in the Nimar Valley agro-climatic zone. Characterization and mapping of salt affected soils in Karnataka: For chacterization and mapping of salt affected soils in Tungabhadra Project (TBP) command, Karnataka, a total of 312 (0-15 cm), 305 (15-30 cm), 240 (30-60 cm) and 168 (60 cm and above) soil samples were collected and analyzed for salinity appraisal from Bellary, Koppal (Gangavati), and Raichur districts in TBP command area. At surface soil (0-15 cm), the pH(1:2.5), pHs, EC (1:2. 5) and ECe varied from 10.76 to 5.72, 10.23 to 4.86, 3.0 to 0.10 (dS/m) and 75.0 to 0.14 (dS/m), respectively, with an average of 8.09, 7.58, 2.11, and 5.06 respectively. Among cations, average Na content (40.57 meq/l) was more than Ca+Mg (13.06 meq/l) followed by K. In case of anions, average Cl- content was more (36.21 meq/l) than HCO3 - (12.02 meq/l) followed SO4 2-. Nearly 20% of surface samples had ECe > 4.0 dS/m reflecting that these soils are saline. With respect to area, about 23.62% (85,692 ha) and 14.36 % (52,097 ha) of the TBP command area had ECe 2.0-4.0 dS/m and 4.0-8.0 dS/m, respectively. However, nearly 50% of the area had ECe< 2.0 dS/m. In about 80% (2,81,892 ha) of the command area, the SARe was < 13 and 7% (25,577 ha) area had SARe in the range of 13-20. Soil pHs varied between 7.50 â€“ 8.50 in about 2,69,992 ha (74%) of the command area. The percentage of samples with > 1 ratios of CO3+HCO3 : Cl+SO4 and Cl+SO4 were to the extent of nearly 12.5 and 45.5, respectively, indicating that the soils could be sodic or developing into sodic. Accordingly, nearly 23.7% of surface samples had SARe>13. In case of subsurface samples (15-30 cm), nearly 15% of samples were considered to be saline as the ECe of these samples was >4.0 dS/m. The overall mean of the (CO3+HCO3)/(Cl+SO4) was less than 1, whereas Na/(Cl+SO4) was >1. However, about 16 and 49.5% of these samples had values more than 1 indicating that these samples could be considered as salt affected soils in particular sodic or developing into sodicity. About 23% of samples analyzed had SARe>13. Not much variation was observed with respect to the average pH, EC, pHs and ECe at 30-60 and above 60 cm depths compared to 15-30 cm. Flue gas desulphurization gypsum-A potential amendment for reclamation of sodic soils: Flue gas desulphurization gypsum (FGDG; calcium sulphate dihydrate, CaSO4.H2O) is a by product of coal-fired power generation plants where sulphur get scrubbed from combustion of gases. FGDG has become widely available as a byproduct of forced-oxidation wet scrubbers that are used to reduce sulphur emissions (SOX) from coal- fired power plants using a spray of limestone slurry. ICAR-CSSRI and NTPC jointly initiated a collaborative work to study the efficiency and efficacy of FGDG in the reclamation of sodic soils.
