There has been tremendous increase in the competency enhancement of all categories of employees with judicious use of HRD fund. The overall impact of training has been Considerable-Great Extent. I compliment ICAR for effective HRM Initiatives and Accomplishments during a short span of four years. I hope, this publication will be useful for further scaling up the Training and Capacity Building of employees of ICAR as well as of other Central Govt. Ministeries/ Departments.

The right type of training at right stage of career enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the employees leading to higher organizational performance. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) decided to lay more thrust and focus on competency enhancement of all categories of employees for better realization of organizational mandate and vision. ICAR is served by about 19, 200 employees under four different categories namely Scientific, Technical, Administrative and Skilled Support Staff. Developing competency of each employee of different category as per National Training Policy - 2012 of GoI was a great challenge for an organization like ICAR. This needed concerted and focused initiatives to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of each employee through various training and capacity building programmes. In order to develop a system of training in ICAR, Assistant Director General (Human Resource Management) was appointed to act as Training Manager and created HRM Unit at ICAR Headquarters in 2014. Subsequently, Institutionalized System of Training was developed and ìICAR HRM Policy : Training and Capacity Buildingîwas formulated and implemented.
