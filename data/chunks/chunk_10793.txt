   To mix the culture in the seeds, dissolve 50 grams of jaggery in half a liter of water. Then add 250 g of rhizobium culture in this solution, by spraying it over 10 kg of seed and mixing it lightly, to make a light layer over theseed.   After drying this seed 2-3 hours in the shade, do sowing till 10 am or after 4 pm. There is a possibility of the death of culture bacteria in strong sunlight. In fields where groundnut is being sown for the first time or after a long time, it is necessary to useculture.   The use of fertilizers is very important to get good groundnut yield. It would be appropriate that fertilizers be used based on soil testing recommendations. If not tested, nitrogen 20 kg, phosphorus 30 kg, potash 45 kg,gypsum 250 kg, and borax 4 kg, per hectare should beused.   To control broad leaf and narrow weeds use imazethapyr @ 100 g/ha 7. Soybean   Grow improved varieties PK-472, JS-715, PS-564,PK262, JS-2,JS 935, JS 7244, Pusa- 20, Pusa- 16 and PK 416 according to the availability of growing period andpurpose   It is ready in about 120-125 days. It should be sown in Mid June to the first fortnight ofJuly.   Distance of 2 lines should be 45 cm and distance between 2 plants should be 3-5cm with depth of seed not more than 3-4cms. Use 70-75 kg seed kernels/ha for all varieties. In late sown conditions, Use 75-80 kg seed kernels/ha. Germination percentage should not be less than75- 80. 8. Sesamum   Grow improved varieties Type-4, Type-12, Type-13, Type-78, Shekhar, Pragati, Tarun and RT- 351 according to the availability of growing period andpurpose   It is ready in about 90-95 days. It should be sown in the last week of June to the second fortnight of July.   According to the species and season, the number of seeds and distance of 2 lines should be 30- 45. Use 3-4 kg seed kernels/ha for all varieties. Due to the small size of the seeds, sow the seeds by mixing them in sand, ash, or dry light loamysoil. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 58   To prevent seed-borne diseases, 2 grams of Thiram, and 1 gram of Carbendazim per kg for seedtreatment.   Use fertilizers based on soil testing. If the soil has not been tested, 30 kg Nitrogen, 20 kg Phosphorus, and 20 kg Sulfur per hectare should be used. Use 20 kg Potash in rocky soil. Use half the amount of nitrogen and full quantity of phosphorus and potash and sulfur, as a basal dressing at the time of sowing, and the remaining quantity of nitrogen at the time of constantweeding.   Spraying of 2% urea solution at the time of flowering and formation of pods in the crop will lead to an expected increase inyield.   First weeding should be done after 15-20 days of sowing and second weeding should be done after 30-35 days. Thinning (weeding) of the plants during weeding and maintain plant distance for about 10 to 12 cm. Use 1.25 liters per hectare Elachlor 50 E.C. for weedcontrol.   Irrigation is required when the plant has 50-60% pods but has a lack ofmoisture. 9.
