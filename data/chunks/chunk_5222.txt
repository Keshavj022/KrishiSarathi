 The latter had consistently lower alcohol levels than the first bottle. The trend can be clearly related with method of distillation normally employed in production of such beverages. Last bottle, or what is called tail, is considerably lower in alcohol content. 2. A comparison of alcohol content in these beverages would suggest that the first three samples had more than twice the normal alcohol, whereas fourth and fifth are acceptable, and that of the last bottle was considerably lower than required. The alcohol levels in various beverages varied from beverage to beverage. Cider has 4_9%, table wine 11%, fortified wine 20%, whisky 42% and brandy 42_50%, depending upon the brand. 3. From safety point of view, all the beverages were negative for methyl alcohol content. It is desirable, since methyl alcohol contents in the alcoholic beverages should be as low as possible. Small amount of methanol can be present in the brandy due to its similar properties as that of ethyl alcohol. Its amount in the California brandies has been found to be in the range of traces to 0.1888%, but fruit brandies in general have higher methyl alcohol levels than grape brandies. The methyl alcohol content is dependent upon many factors like the microorganisms employed during fermentation, the pectin content and the method of distillation.  ETHNIC FOOD Table 3. Physico-chemical characteristics of distilled beverage Sample Alcohol content (%) Methyl alcohol Ester (mg/100 ml of absolute alcohol) Total acidity absolute (mg/100 ml of alcohol) Volatile acidity (mg/100 ml of absolute alcohol) Added colouring matter First bottle 107.76 - 380.00 124.80 39.00 Absent (fruit + molasses) Middle bottle 88.46 - 137.80 191.00 61.00 Absent (fruit + molasses) Last Bottle 72.70 - 163.10 271.20 79.89 Absent (fruit + molasses) Combined Extraction 33.98 - 368.91 1,851.47 677.88 Absent First Bottle (Only Fruit) 33.08 - 1,024.18 3,188.66 1,050.45 Absent Middle Bottle (Only Frui) 22.33 - 622.06 4,737.75 1,874.72 Absent Last Bottle (Only Fruit) 17.03 - 517.25 6,451.14 2,481.69 Absent 4. Ester content in all the distillates was quite high, as is in the case of total and volatile acidity, especially the values of fifth, sixth and seventh samples. The optimum levels of total ester content are considered desirable, as it would impart fruity flavour to the beverages. Its formation is also associated with maturation of beverages. But considerably higher quantities of these in this study make the beverages unpalatable. 5. Higher volatile acidity of product fourth, to seventh samples can be correlated with such higher values in the liquor that can be considered spoiled or nearly spoiled. 6. Absence of any extraneous matter in all the samples indicates the satisfactory hygienic conditions present in their production area. 7. Considering the overall results, some improvement in the quality is needed. To improve the quality characteristics of such beverages, fermentation should be conducted with pure yeast.
