 Plant types with novel variation, from creeping, semi-erect and erect with broad and large leaves to small and curly leaves, have been developed for site-specific utilization Berseem WARDAN is a single plant selection from the segregating polyploid material. It has been released in 1982 and is at present a National check variety The protein-rich Leucaena atisiliqua is planted for browsing in most pastoral system. It helps the animal in gaining body weight quickly IGFRI has developed many varieties of Trifolium alexandrinum, berseem. The recent ones are: JHB- ISB-86 and JHB 146 for the South and Central North-West Zones Pennisetum pedicellatum BUNDEL«DINANATH 2 has been developed for marginal drylands Green chopped fodder is ensiled in kachacha or cemented pits in compacted layers, 25-30 cm thick, and covered with polythene and soil layer. The conserved fodder is fed to the livestock during lean period. Addition of 0.5% urea makes it more nutritive nie j | hy iy bet al To evaluate quality parameters of feeds and fodder, laboratory tests are conducted at the IGFRI, Jhansi For developing multi-tier cropping system, the micro-environment variation in tree-crop interactions are studied IGFRI TYRE-TYPE SEED PELLETING MACHINE can produce 20-25 kg of seed pellets in an hour MACHINES DEVELOPED AT IGFRI IGFRIPOWER-OPERATED PELLETING MACHINE operating on a5 kW electric motor makes 80 kg of feed pellets or 100 kg seed pellets in an hour = All forage seed produced is processed before it is distributed for wholesale or retail IGFRI ROTARY DISC MOWER has been designed for harvesting berseem and the oat crops. Its capacity is 0,22 hectare per hour and efficiency, 62% This simple machine helps in baling of grasses for convenient transportation With the help of this device attached to a tractor, the surplus green fodder is heaped 1-1.5 m high for ensiling ALysimeter has been developed to measure the specific requirement of water at various stages of crop growth vm fe IGFRI TRACTOR-MOUNTED IMPROVED GRASS SEED HARVESTER has been developed for harvesting mature grass seeds of Cenchrus ciliaris, C. setigerus and Dinanath grass at 50-170 cm height.
