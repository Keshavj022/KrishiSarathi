 Graded up chicks comprising 1,634 Naked Neck and 1,525 Frizzle of second generation (graded up with White Leghorn) were hatched. Fertility values in graded Naked Neck and Frizzle were 80.20 and 74.24%, respectively, and corresponding values for hatchability for TES were 61.29 and 76.42%, while these values for FES were 76.42 and 80.79% respectively. Results of the first generation of grading up of Naked Neck and Frizzle population with White Leghorn showed significant improvement in the part time egg production (40 weeks of age) in both the lines, but significant decrease in egg weight was also observed in both the lines. Mean time egg productions of 101.61 and 99.33 eggs were recorded for second generation graded Naked Neck and Frizzle population, The Barbari goat has extensively been used under goat development programme Hatchability was highest in Kadakanath LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 89 which were 12 and 11 eggs more than the previous generation for the respective population. In this generation the egg weight decreased in Frizzle fowl population but not in Naked Neck population. Mithun: Conservation and improvement of mithun is the second important mandate of the NRC on Mithun, Nagaland. Research programmes on ex situ conservation particularly through sperm conservation were carried out during the year. Yak: Survey on yak genetic resources and their feeding resources was initiated in Ladakh region. Immunogenetics of Indian Livestock Cattle: IL-2 in the blood plasma of normal and diseased animals was quantified. Blood samples were collected from Sahiwal, Tharparkar, Karan Fries and Karan Swiss animals. The range of interleukin-2 in the blood plasma of normal animals of Sahiwal, Tharparkar, Karan Swiss and Karan Fries was 400-745.5, 540-772.5, 425- 691.5 and 450-500.2 pg/ml, respectively, and in animals suffering from mastitis was 584.7-899.1, 577.6-836.9, 563.2-670.1 and 580.7-780 pg/ml, respectively. Quantification of IL-2 by ELISA in culture supernatants was also carried out. IL-2 secretion varied from 34 pg/ml in supernatant harvested at 45 min to around 340 pg/ml in supernatants harvested in 24 hr. Cell proliferation for the same number of cells in the culture was higher when supernatant-containing IL-2 was added. At the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal, a highly specific and sensitive antirabbit IgG (second antibody) was produced indigenously, and is now being routinely used in EIA procedures. Horses: At the National Research Centre (NRC) on Equines, Hisar, biochemical polymorphic studies and estimation of the gene frequency in Marwari breed of horses were carried out. Molecular Genetic Characterization of Indigenous Livestock and Poultry Cattle: At the NBAGR, Karnal, genetic characterization using 25 FAO recommended microsatellite markers was completed in 48 unrelated samples of Sahiwal cattle. Similarly 33 DNA samples of Hariana cattle were analyzed using 12 microsatellite markers.
