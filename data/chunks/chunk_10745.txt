Due to such erratic changes in climate change in past year, there is urgent need to adopt climate resilient technologies such as direct seeded rice (DSR), staggered nursery transplanting, promotion of hybrids, bio-fortified varieties, focused approach on pulses and oilseeds, and crop diversification can help address these challenges but require new approaches to policy and incentives for change. In its 1stlong-range forecast for Southwest Monsoon 2022, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted normal seasonal rainfall over the country which is likely to be 96-104% of the Long Period Average (LPA) of 880 mm. The normal monsoon prediction indicates good agriculture production in the country. Rainfed agriculture occupies almost half of country’s net sown area and accounts for nearly 40 percent of the total food production. Major field crops cultivated in Kharif include cereals (paddy, maize, millets); oilseeds (groundnut, soybean, sesame); pulses (blackgram, greengram, pigeonpea, moth bean, cluster bean and horsegram); commercial crops like cotton, sugarcane, spices, vegetables and fruit crops. Successful pulse production in recent past in the country need not only be sustained but also to be enhanced by introducing inter-cropping of pulses with oilseeds, sugarcane, maize, cotton and judicious use of plant protection measures for control of insects, pests and diseases. Likewise, oilseed production will require adoption of planting techniques like Broad Bed Furrow (BBF) and Ridge furrow system, availability of seeds of improved varieties, replacement of upland/low yielding paddy area with oilseeds. Impetus to horizontal coverage to oil palm in North Eastern states holds good for improving edible oil production.
