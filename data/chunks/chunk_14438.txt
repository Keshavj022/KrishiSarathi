 Increased paddy cultivation (2.80 million ha in 2011 to 3.20 million ha in 2020), mechanization of farming, and certain government policies (e.g., policy-backed delay in rice trans­ planting to save groundwater) likely have promoted ABA and made Punjab the top emitter of pollutants from CRB (Liu et al., 2019). The GoI has implemented several measures to address agricultural residue burning, including imposing fines on farmers who burn crop residue, promoting renewable energy policies to produce biofuels from crop residue, and providing incentives for non-residue burning farmers and disincentives for those who burn crop residues (Datta et al., 2020; Kaur et al., 2022). The impact of the National Policy for Management of Crop Residues launched in 2014 and the subsequent banning of crop residue burning by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2015 on residue burning was seen in our data. Specifically, we saw a sharp decrease in ABA in 2014 and 2015, indicating initial success. However, we saw a significant surge in CRB in 2016, likely because the measures became ineffective due to faulty implementation and the inability to incentivize smallholder farmers (Bhuvaneshwari et al., 2019). These results suggest the need for more effective and sustainable policies to address CRB across India. Interestingly, the nationwide lockdown imposed due to the COVID- 19 pandemic in 2020 led to heterogeneous impacts on CRB across states in India. Some states, including Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telan­ gana, and Karnataka, showed a sudden increase in CRB activities, while other states, including Haryana, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha, showed a decrease in CRB activities. Other states, including Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan, did not show any significant change in CRB activities in 2020. One possible reason that explains differences in CRB across Indian states during the COVID-19 lockdown is the migration of agricultural labourers back to their home states during the pandemic (Ravindra et al., 2022). As most of the labour force comes from north-eastern India, it is possible that these states (e.g., Bihar) had enough of a workforce to manage residues without burning, whereas those states that suffered from the scarcity of agricultural labourers (e.g., Andhra Pradesh) resorted to burning to manage residues (Ravindra et al., 2022). A future work should investi­ gate the impact of labour migration on emission characteristics in detail. If we compare our emission estimates with those from previous Table 3 Uncertainty associated with each individual component of Eqs. (1) and (2).
