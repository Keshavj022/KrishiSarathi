 But, in current scenario, the viability of marginal and small dairy farms is affected by rising costs of input and services. Marketing of milk: There is a strong need to promote organized procurement and processing of milk as currently only 15-20% of milk is handled by organized sector. Poor livestock extension services: There is urgent need to strengthen the livestock extension network as very less farm households (5%) in India have access to information on livestock. Value addition of livestock products: Value addition at farm level is a good option for making livestock farming sustainable. But, value addition in milk and meat at farm is negligible at present. 457 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Diversified livestock farming i.e. promotion of Goatry and Piggery: There is need of diversifying the livestock farming by promoting goatry and piggery as these enterprises are more profitable compared to dairy farming. Lack of market infrastructure for goat, pig and fisheries: The market infrastructure is not well developed for goat and pig farming compared to dairy farming. The development of goat and pig farming, adequate market infrastructure is need of the hour. Culling of stray and unproductive cattle: There is no concrete govt. policy regarding culling of stray and unproductive animals. This poses a great chance to the emergence of infectious/communicable diseases. Fodder pool is also shrinking due to unproductive animals. 22.2 Strategies and Interventions for doubling of Farmers Income Strategies to be followed in Crop Sector:   Enhancing farm productivity and stability of production by supporting the farmers in the areas of soil health care, water harvesting and management, choice of appropriate technology and inputs, credit and insurance, opportunities for remunerative and assured marketing   Encourage crop diversification among farmers so that they allocate larger proportion of their cultivated land to crops having more comparative advantage rather than growing rice or wheat alone   Promotion of intensive vegetable production by using improved varieties, organic manure and drip irrigation, can provide higher annual income to the farmers (BAIF’s experience in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka & Maharashtra)   Precision farming techniques which can help to enhance productivity and reduce the cost of production should be promoted   Increase Farm Mechanization through custom hiring centres   Low cost storage facilities and quality packing materials should be developed so that farmers can store their produce at farm level and avoid distress sale   Primary processing at the farmers level   Develop value chain for all the commodities   Quality of the produce should be ensured Strategies to be followed in Processing and Value Addition:   Small farmers needs to associate and form commodity groups/ processor companies for better earning profits.
