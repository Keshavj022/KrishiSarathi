 Food security status of households IJSE 48,3 446 table, averagely, UA households in Ghana are mildly food insecure represented by 4.05 compared to 7.91 (moderately food insecure) in India. The Wald test of Insigma2 from Table 4, which is a test for variance function, is significant, suggesting a possible heteroskedasticity in the model; hence the model used was best fit for the analysis. Additionally, the probability > chi value is significant (p < 0.01), indicating that the independent variables significantly explain the dependent variables (log of the extent of UA, refer to Table 1 for details) in the model. The determinants of the extent of participation in UA in Ghana and India are presented in Table 4. From the table, there is an inverse relationship between age the extent of UA participation in India but was insignificant in Ghana. On the contrary, education has a significant positive influence on the extent of participation in UA in both Ghana (p < 0.05) and India (p < 0.01). Likewise, there was a positive relationship between household size and the extent of participation in UA in both countries. The result validates earlier study by Mackay (2018), who reported that household size was averagely bigger in UA households to non- farming households in Ghana. A plausible reason for this phenomenon could be that there is a possible increase in the consumption expenditure of the household, hence, the likelihood of the household to use any available land at their disposal to produce crops or rear animals to support the home. The results, however, contrast with the findings by Orsini et al. (2013).
