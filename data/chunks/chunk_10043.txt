Mandate and activities • Basic, strategic and adaptive research on biotic stresses in agriculture. • Development of quality human resources for academic excellence, linkage with various stakeholders for technology management and policy support research. Activities • Utilizing modern frontier science-based plant resistance sourcing and its exploitation. • Understanding the biology of crops as influenced by biotic stresses. • Holistic crop health management. • Undertake relevant policy support research for biotic stress management. 3. Salient achievements • Efforts of native bio-control agents identified three signature kairomones to enhance the parasitic activity of Trichogrammaspp., Bacillus thuringiensis strains (three strains), endophytes (one strain), and bacteriophages (two strains) with enhanced antagonistic effects to microbial pathogens. • Silicon application studies revealed its wide-spread involvement in imparting tolerance to borers in rice (yellow stem borer) and wheat (pink stem borer) and to improve crop- production traits. • Pan India mapping of the genetic groups of white-fly (Bemisiatabaci) revealed prevalence of eleven distinct genetic groups. Three amongst these, viz., Asia II-3, Asia II-6 and Asia III are reported for the first time from India. • Identified and characterized bacterial endophytes effective for biotic (Sclerotium rolfsii) and abiotic (drought) stresses withplant growth promotion activities in chickpea. • Developed improved agro-inoculation method for Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus suitable for screening against yellow mosaic resistance in mungbean, giving 100 percent infection. 41 Crop Science 41 4. Knowledge/skill/technologies/products other services available for different stake holders Following products are under large scale evaluation for finalization 1. Three native Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) isolates are found to effective in causing mortality on Spodopteralitura both under lab and in planta conditions. One isolate is under large scale field evaluation. 2. Application of kairomone (Octadecane 500 ppm)gel formulation enhanced the parasitic activity of Trichogramma japonicum by reducing the damage caused by rice yellow stem borer. Developed Improved agroinoculation method for screening against yellow mosaic disease for resistance in mungbean giving 100 % infection 42 ICAR Institutes Profile 42 ICAR-National Institute for Plant Biotechnology 1.
