 Out of 153 water blocks of Punjab, only 17 are safe and the remaining 136 (89%) are in alarming condition. Further, electricity demand is increasing for irrigating the paddy crop which undermines the viability of the power sector as power for agricultural use is fully subsidized in the state. In addition, yield stability and assured marketing of paddy makes it the most remunerative rainy (kharif) season crop. Despite various efforts by the state government, Direct seeding of rice under tar-wattar conditions by using lucky seed drill Indian Farming 37 August 2023 the area under DSR in the state has not increased. Recently, as a pilot project, the state government has shortlisted 16 blocks in 16 districts (where water level has dropped from 21.3–1.5 m since 1998) in which 1.5 lakh acres have been planned to be sown with DSR technique during 2023–24. In this backdrop, the study was carried out in of Punjab to examine the status of adoption of DSR along with relative economic benefits and constraints faced by the farmers in its adoption. The primary data pertaining to the input use pattern, use of labour and machinery, associated variable costs in DSR technique vis-à-vis PTR method of paddy transplanting were collected from 120 farmers (80 adopters and 40 non-adopters) from Giddarbaha and Muktsar blocks of the Sri Muktsar Sahib district having highest area under DSR in the state. Status of DSR adoption in Punjab DSR is yet to become an integral part of the farming ecosystem in Punjab. As per information obtained from the Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Government of Punjab provided with the subsidy of `1500 per acre for adopting the DSR to 30553 farmers for which `25 crores have been disbursed during 2021–22. During this year, the area under DSR in the state was 84.9 thousand hectares forming only about 3% of the total area under paddy (3144.6 thousand ha). District wise analysis revealed that the highest proportion of area under DSR was in Sri Muktsar Sahib district (20.8%) followed by Fazilka (19.28%), Bathinda (12.6%), Firozpur (6.86%) and Mansa (5.78%) while for other districts it lied below 5%. In terms of number of beneficiary farmers, the maximum belonged to Fazilka district (19.8%) followed by Sri Muktsar Sahib (16.3%), Bathinda (12.1%), Mansa (7.8%) and Sangrur (5.7%). With regard to the subsidy availed, Sri Muktsar Sahib is ranked first with about 23% share followed by Fazilka (20.8%), Bathinda (12.8%), Firozpur (6%) and Mansa (5.9%) with rest districts having share of below 5% in the total subsidy availed. Thus, DSR had higher adoption in the south western region of the state. The major reason behind this is the poor quality of groundwater in most areas in this region which is not fit for irrigation.
