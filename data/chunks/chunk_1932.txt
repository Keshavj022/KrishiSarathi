 The collaboration of AI and IoT finds applications in healthcare for remote monitoring and predictive analytics, smart agriculture for precision farming, and energy management for optimizing consumption. This synergy extends to smart cities, where AI-powered IoT devices contribute to traffic management and public services. Overall, the convergence of AI and IoT holds tremendous potential, ushering in a new era of intelligent, adaptive, and efficient systems. 3.2. Machine Learning (ML) Machine learning is essentially the scientific approach enabling machines to interpret, process, and analyze data for addressing real-world issues. It is simply a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that imparts machines with the capacity to autonomously learn and enhance their performance through experience, without explicit programming. In essence, machine learning involves empowering machines to think and solve problem. This discipline relies on vast amounts of both structured and unstructured data, ensuring that machine learning models deliver accurate results or predictions based on the acquired knowledge. Application of machine learning in agriculture allows more efficient and precise farming with less human manpower with high quality production. Machine learning is categorized into four types, namely: a. Supervised Learning: A supervised learning algorithm gains knowledge from labelled training data, enabling it to make predictions for new, unseen data. For instance, supervised learning can be employed to predict crop yield or disease and pest detection based on training data. In this scenario, the input variables may include factors such as the geographic location, weather patterns, soil quality etc. locality and size of a house. Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report training produces a satisfactory outcome. This entire sequence must be repeated multiple times to achieve optimal results. Artificial Intelligence in loT involves embedding Al technologies, such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, into loT devices, sensors, and platforms to enable smart decision-making, learning, and autonomous actions. It represents the integration of Al capabilities into loT devices and systems, enabling these devices to analyze data, make decisions, and perform tasks autonomously. It aims to enhance the intelligence and efficiency of loT deployments by leveraging Al algorithms and techniques. Al enhances loT capabilities by enabling the analysis of vast amounts of real-time data generated by loT devices, facilitating predictive maintenance, and identifying patterns or anomalies. Machine learning contributes to smart automation and behavioral analytics, allowing loT devices to adapt and optimize processes based on user behavior. In terms of security, Al implements advanced measures such as anomaly detection, authentication, and authorization to safeguard loT networks.
