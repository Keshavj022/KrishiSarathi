 Attribution to this could be that urban areas in Ghana have a higher cost of living owing to heavy reliance on imports than India, which depends more on domestic production. Using a five-point interval scale (from strongly disagree to strongly agree), respondents were asked to indicate their views on safe food. The mean of their views was high, with approximately four for both Ghana and India. Likewise, the opinion of respondents on fear of pesticides was averagely three for both countries. Again, on the consumption of nutritious food, the opinions of respondents indicated a high mean of 3.54 and 3.84 for Ghana and India, respectively. Similarly, respondents’ perception of postharvest losses of urban produce showed a mean of 2.92 for Ghana and 2.94 for India, indicating, urban farmers do not think postharvest losses constitute a significant challenge in UA. More so, respondents who used UA as a form of business had means of 4.12 and 3.21 for Ghana and India, respectively signifying that most of the households undertook UA as a business. Averagely, from the results, households in India had better more contact with extension officers compared to Ghana. Further, farmers with a contract agreement with buyers showed an average of 0.35 in Ghana and 0.73 in India, demonstrating that, contract farming is more well-known among urban farmers in India than in Ghana. Averagely, in Ghana, the walking distance to the nearest market was 21.41 min while in India, it was 29.41 min. In Table 3, the food-security status of UA households in both Ghana and India is presented. The individual household food-security scores from the HFIAS model were categorised by following Chakona and Shackleton (2018). From Table 3, about 58% of the households in Ghana (which is represented by 203 of the sample) were food secured. In contrast, none of the households in India was food secured. The differences could be attributed to the characteristics of households in Ghana; in the middle zone of Ghana, the Bono and Bono East Regions to be specific are known to be the foodbasket of Ghana, hence, there is the likelihood that, most of the households that were interviewed in the area are pulling the food security status of the Ghana data upwards. Meanwhile, in India, Bihar is known to be one of the poorest and food-insecured states, hence, the results. About 48% of the households in India, compared to 14% of the households in Ghana, are mildly food secured. Approximately 38% of the households in India were severely food insecure compared to 12.3% of the households in Ghana that were severely food insecure. From the Food security categorisation Ghana India Frequency Percentage Average HFIAS score Frequency Percentage Average HFIAS score Food secured 203 58.0 4.05 - - 7.91 Mildly Food Insecure 49 14.0 144 48.0 Moderately Food Insecure 55 15.7 43 14.3 Severely Food Insecure 43 12.3 113 37.7 Source(s): Authors’ own, 2019.
