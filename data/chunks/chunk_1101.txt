B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin) and folic acid (Table 3). The B-vitamins are mainly present in the bran and germ layers and hence decortication, a commonly employed processing technique to convert the small millets in to edible form, is known to reduce these micronutrients.

Sorghum and finger millet are known to contain tannins, polyphenolic compounds with some anti-nutritional properties. The anti-nutrients are found in the outer layers of the grain and hence, the common household processing methods including decortication, milling, soaking, roasting, germination, fermentation Table 1.

Phytochemicals: Much of the health beneficial effects of millets have been attributed to the presence of abundant phytochemicals including phenolic compounds, phytosterols etc. Phenolic compounds, viz. phenolic acids, flavonoids etc which are present in millets impart bioactivities including anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, and anti-hypertensive properties.
