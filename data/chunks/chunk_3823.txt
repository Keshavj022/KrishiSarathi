 These frameworks can include measures to control access to certain species, define sustainable harvesting quotas, and ensure compliance with sustainable practices. Education and awareness: Raising awareness among stakeholders, including local communities, practitioners, and consumers, about the importance of sustainable utilization is essential. Education programs can promote responsible harvesting, cultivation, and consumption of MAPs. Certification and labelling: Establishing certification schemes and labelling systems can help consumers make informed choices and support sustainable products. Labels such as organic, fair trade, or sustainably sourced can provide assurance regarding the ethical and sustainable practices used in the production of MAPs. Collaboration and partnerships: Collaboration among governments, NGOs, local communities, and industry stakeholders is crucial for implementing sustainable practices. Public-private partnerships can facilitate knowledge sharing, capacity building, and the development of sustainable supply chains. Future prospects Conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in Medicinal and Aromatic Plants in India is a very important component towards overall growth. The following steps are important to take this work forward: y Use of GIS will help in Geo-referencing/gap analysis and prediction and distribution of species using environmental variables to plan future explorations besides mapping of trait-specific germplasms with respect to bioactive compounds. y Use of biotechnological tools like in vitro storage/ cryopreservation including pollen preservation to strengthen the conservation of MAPs. y Use of molecular marker tools like SSR/SNP/GWAS to improve the understanding of extent, nature and distribution of diversity in MAPs; and develop the varieties with high yield and quality for sustainable production.

This small deciduous tree species is native to India and plays a vital role in various ecosystems, and highly valued for its resin, which has been used for centuries in traditional Indian medicine, particularly in Ayurveda. Consequently, it has gained recognition worldwide, leading to high demand and excessive exploitation. The conservation of guggul is essential to ensure the species’ long-term survival and maintain ecological balance. C OMMIPHORA wightii, commonly known as Indian Bdellium or Guggul, is a small to medium-sized tree belonging to the Burseraceae family.
