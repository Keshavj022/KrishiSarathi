 - Country specifics (Including geographical location) In the recent past, Indian fisheries has witnessed a paradigm shift from marine dominated fisheries to inland fisheries, with the latter emerging as a major contributor of fish production in India. Within inland fisheries, a shift from capture to culture-based fisheries has paved the way for sustained blue economy. But, in capture fisheries, the development in terms of its production potential is yet to be realized. In this context, the advance technology of ICT, automation and sensors can play a major role in achieving this production potential. The present loT based automated DO monitoring system is suitable for any cultured fisheries system specially in fish farming states of India like UP, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, WB, Odisha, AP, Telangana etc. to improve the water quality for the fish survival. -Process flow diagram The process flow diagram indicates the process involved in the DO monitoring system for managing the DO level in the waterbody. DO sensor is placed in the water tank or waterbody. The sensor is connected to the controller box. In the controller box, the DO data is analyzed, processed and converted into computer understandable language. Then the system sends the data to the cloud server which is kept dedicated for the system via. Internet. The Internet connected through Wi-Fi. On the same time the system controls the aerator whenever there is a drop of dissolve oxygen in the water. / Cloud/Server WIFI Module \/ or | Pc | | i loT system Microcontroller| ESP32 age = — Aerator on when DO Dissolved | Aerator ~ < threshold level L_ Oxygen é 3 a i (DO) Sensor Mobile Fig 1 Process flow diagram of the system TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 108 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 109 -Outcomes/ results of use case Automated DO management system will help to take automated decision that will immediately respond to improve the environment by controlling DO level in the waterbody and hence will prevent further deterioration of ambient water condition. It also generates real-time water parameter status report in the cloud-based application for monitoring purpose which is accessed via internet from any desktop or mobile (Table 2). The temporal variation of the DO level of the pond system is plotted in Fig 2.
