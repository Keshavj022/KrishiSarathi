 Irrigation plays a critical role in the cultivation cycle, with crucial stages including flower initiation and pod filling requiring timely watering. Moreover, to mitigate transplanting shock, irrigation is compulsory on the day of transplanting, contributing to the overall success of the cultivation process. Advantages of redgram transplanting technology Redgram transplanting technology presents a paradigm shift in agricultural practices, offering a multitude of advantages that cater to the needs of farmers, especially small and marginal ones. • The method involves advanced sowing, ensuring optimal planting conditions and leading to reduced pod borer damage due to early and efficient planting. • The deep rooting characteristic enhances drought resistance, a crucial feature in regions prone to water scarcity. • Notably, this approach facilitates significant savings in seeds, contributing to cost- effectiveness. • The ease with which plant protection measures can be implemented adds to its appeal, making it a practical choice for farmers. • Moreover, the technology promotes increased branching, promising a 2-3 fold rise in yield levels, thereby enhancing overall productivity. • In essence, redgram transplanting technology emerges as a tailor-made solution, aligning with the specific needs of small and marginal farmers, ultimately fostering sustainable and efficient agricultural practices. Efforts of ICAR-KVK, Bidar for dissemination of redgram transplanting technology The Krishi Vigyan Kendra Bidar has implemented a multifaceted approach to disseminate redgram transplanting technology, encompassing various channels and initiatives. A robust framework of 85 training programs has been established to educate and empower individuals with the latest technological knowledge. Additionally, 24 field days serve as interactive platforms for practical learning and hands-on experiences. Exhibitions (23), provide a public showcase for cutting-edge technologies. The dissemination strategy extends to the airwaves with 10 radio programs and 18 television programs, reaching a wider audience. Print media is leveraged through 50 publications, while 20,000 leaflets are distributed to further enhance awareness. A CD has been prepared as a comprehensive resource, complemented by 26 mobile messages for timely updates. Furthermore, the organization actively participates in the sale of 200 quintals of BSMR-736 seeds under a revolving fund. In synergy, these initiatives form a cohesive strategy to bridge the technological gap, further augmented by the inclusion of the university calendar.
