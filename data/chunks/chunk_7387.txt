) in a single farm unit to ensure year-round income and employment for a farm family having 1 ha irrigated land. Net income of model was ` 3.87 lakh/year along with 628 man days engaged throughout the years. The highest net income (` 1.68 lakh/year) was obtained from livestock (3 crossbreed cows) enterprise followed by crop (` 1.06 lakh). Model depicted that the total carbon assimilation by the crop enterprises was 4,448 kg/annum. Carbon cycle assessed using farm design tool showed that total input of carbon from the crop enterprises to household and animal was 603 and 5,555 kg/annum respectively. The addition of carbon from crop and livestock manure to the soil was 256 and 1,698 kg/annum respectively. Overall accumulation of carbon in the soil was 1,955 kg per annum which ultimately enriches the organic matter pool of the soil. View of water harvesting pond and rainfed IFS model. market), rain-fed crop dominated IFS with greater emphasis on rainfed crops and water harvesting (rainfed crop based farmers) and rainfed livestock dominated IFS with focus on livestock, rainfed fodder and crops and water harvesting (for rainfed livestock based farmers). Among the irrigated IFS models, dairy based IFS resulted in the highest net return (` 162,593), employment (431 man-days/year) and resource recycling followed by intensive IFS with balanced enterprises (` 108,638 and 336 man-days/year, respectively) while the B:C ratio was the highest in intensive IFS with balanced enterprises (1.58) followed by dairy based IFS (1.52). On the other hand, among the rainfed models, highest net return (` 37,424) and B:C ratio (2.03) was observed in rainfed crop dominated IFS as compared to rainfed forage dominated IFS. The average annual income of irrigated and rainfed farmers in Bundelkhand region is ` 80,000 to 10,000 and ` 25,000 to 30,000, respectively, which can be enhanced to ` 160,000 and ` 40,000 by adopting dairy and rainfed IFS models, respectively. IGFRI is An android based nitrogen fertilizer recommendation app for riceNxpert: ICAR-NRRI developed ‘riceNxpert’ an android based mobile application to monitor the leaf N content based on leaf greenness and determine real time N fertilizer requirements to synchronize the demand and supply. The N application using riceNxpert produced higher yield in rice compared to the blanket recommendation. Farmers can download riceNxpert to their smart phone from google play store or ICAR-NRRI website or Graphical user interface of riceNxpert; riceNxpert being used by a farmer in his field Net income though IFS model.

By using this application, images of 10 fully expanded healthy leaves are taken by mobile phone placing a white sheet on the back of the leaf during 8–10 AM from 14 days after sowing or 21 days after transplanting at 3–5 days interval.
