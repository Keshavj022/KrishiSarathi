 Indian Agriculture after Independence 92 The systematic work on pulses improvement started in 1966 with the establishment of the All India Coordinated Pulse Improvement Project (AICPIP) headquartered at IARI, Delhi. The first widely adaptable variety of chickpea C 235 for north India was released in 1972. In 1984, Pusa 256 with improved plant type was developed through Desi x Kabuli introgression. In 1980s, major emphasis was made on the development of short-duration genotypes with disease resistance, particularly fusarium wilt and root rots. Consequently, wilt-resistant chickpea cultivars like Radhey, Avarodi, and KWR 108 were developed. In the late nineties, programmes on drought and heat tolerance and grain quality in chickpea were initiated resulting in the development of a heat-tolerant most popular variety of chickpea JG 14 in 2011 which occupied a sizeable area in Central India (Ali and Gupta, 2012). Recently in 2019, marker-assisted breeding resulted in the development of race-specific wilt-resistant chickpea varieties like Pusa Chickpea 20211, Super Annigeri 1, and IPCMB 19-3 and drought-tolerant chickpea varieties Pusa 10216, IPCL 4-14, and BG 4005. The first extra-large seeded Kabuli Chickpea variety ‘KAK 2’ was released in 1999 which opened the scope for the export of Kabuli chickpea. Subsequently, JGK 6, MNK 1, RLBGK 1, Kota Kabuli chana 2, Shubhra and Ujjawal were released. In recent years, chickpea varieties suitable for mechanical harvesting such as Phule Vikram, Pusa 3062, JG 2016-24, NBeG 47, RVG 204, Shubhra, IPC 2010-134, GBM 2 were also developed. Systematic breeding efforts in pigeonpea started in the seventies resulted in the development of the most popular varieties of early duration UPAS 120 and late duration Bahar, which ruled the pigeonpea cultivation for four decades. Asha was another multiple disease-resistant variety developed in 1993 and covered a large area under pigeonpea. Emphasis on the development of hybrid technology in pigeonpea involving genetic male sterility system was the main focus during the late eighties. Resultantly, ICPH 8, the first GMS-based hybrid in pigeonpea was released in 1991. Later on in 1999, the focus of the hybrid programme has been directed to the cytoplasmic male sterility system, and consequently first GMS-based hybrid in pigeonpea GTH 1 was released in 2006 for Gujarat state. Mungbean improvement programme started back in 1949 with the development of T 44 as the first product of hybridization which was subsequently used as a parent in most of the mungbean varieties released in India. Pusa Baisakhi released in 1971 has been a landmark variety that paved the way for mungbean cultivation possible in summer/spring. Subsequently, several releases like IPM 02-3, Samrat, SML 668 and Virat with a shorter duration and photo-thermo insensitivity increased the area under mungbean cultivation in non-traditional niches from 6 lakh ha to 12 lakh ha in the last 6-7 years.
