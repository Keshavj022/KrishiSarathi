 Of the total weeds during summer season, lowest weeds (No. m2) were appeared in ZTR-ZTR (13.4%), although ZT-ZT (22.1%) and CT-CT (25.5%) had the highest levels of weeds, respectively. Lowest individual weed population of Cyperus iria (13.7%), Commelina benghalensis (13.4%) and Ageratum conyzoides (7.7%) was recorded in ZTR-ZTR, otherwise the density of Panicum dichotomiﬂorum (17.5%) and Poly- gonum alatum (6.4%) was minimum in ZT-ZTR. However, Partheni- um hysterophorus was not appeared in CT-CT and ZT-ZTR which was highest in ZT-ZT (48.7%). Weed management treatments signiﬁcantly affect the pooled density (No. m2) of all the weeds except for Commelina bengalen- sis, Digitaria sanguinalis and Parthenium hystrophorus. Among dif- ferent weed management treatments, IWM-IWM (27.9%) recorded lower percent of total weeds during summer season fol- lowed by H-H (32.3%). IWM-IWM reported lower weed density (No. m2) of Cyperus iria (4.2 m2), Echinochloa colona (11.2 m2), Panicum dichotomiﬂorum (1.7 m2) and Bidens pilosa (1.3 m2). However, H-H had lower weed percentage of Digitaria sanguinalis (29.9%) and Polygonum alatum (18.8%), whereas, Ageratum cony- zoides (23.1%) and Parthenium hysterophorus (16%) were minimum in HW-HW. 3.1.2. Density of weeds in wheat crop Pool density of diverse weed ﬂora during winter season has been given in Table 3. Tillage treatments signiﬁcantly (p = 0.05) af- fect the weed density at maximum weed population stage except for Coronopus didymus. ZT-ZTR reported a lower Lolium temulen- tum population (13.2%) but statistically remained statistically equal to ZT-ZT and ZTR-ZTR. Population of Avena ludoviciana (12.3%), Vicia sativa (6.7%) and Phalaris minor (6.1%) was lower in CT-ZT. Lowest population of Coronopus didymus (7.3%) was report- ed in ZT-ZT followed by CT-ZT (18.5%). Daucus carota, a perennial broad-leave weed, was minimum in CT-CT followed by ZTR-ZTR. ZT-ZTR accumulated higher proportion of Daucus carota (39.3%) followed by CT-ZT (19.4%). Among tillage treatments, Conservation agriculture (ZTR-ZTR) resulted in maximum proportion of weeds (23.6%) followed by ZT-ZTR (22.4%) might be due to the presence of higher population of Vicia sativa and Avena ludoviciana. Weed control treatments sig- niﬁcantly (p = 0.05) affect the population of diverse weed ﬂora ex- cept for Avena ludoviciana. H-H resulted in lower weed density proportion than HW-HW and IWM-IWM i.e. 19.2%, 36.7% and 43.9%, respectively. Lolium temulentum had a lower density propor- tion in H-H (14.4%) which remained statistically alike with HW- HW (23.5%). Vicia sativa (3.4 m2), Phalaris minor, Coronopus didymus (1.2 m2), Poa annua (3.6 m2) and Daucus carota signif- icantly decreased in density after the application of the suggested herbicides (H-H) (9.7 m2). However, the density proportion of Avena ludoviciana was lower in HW-HW (26.3%) followed by H-H (34.6%). 3.1.3.
