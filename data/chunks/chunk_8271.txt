 The sequence of Indian isolate of BMMV shared 74.4–91.7% nucleotides and 87.3–95.7% deduced amino acid similarities with other BMMV isolates. Plantation crops Prophylactic treatment of coconut utilizing talc-coated cake with botanical extracts of Clerodendrum infortunatum and Chromolaena odorata was observed to reduce rhinoceros beetle induced leaf damage by 54%. Spraying young bunches with combination of coconut oil (200 ml) and sulphur (5 g/l) emulsion or spiromesifen (1 ml/l) or neem oil (2%) or common salt (2%) plus APSA (0.2%) were found effective in the suppression of coconut eriophyid mite. The palms treated with chlorantraniliprole (0.018%) and neem oil (0.5%) recorded 73-75% reduction of coreid bug incidence in coconut. The IPM module was developed for the management of root grubs in arecanut garden by timely collection of beetles, application of insecticide (bifenthrin 2 kg ai/ha), imidacloprid @ 0.045%) and entomopathogenic nematode (Steinernema carpocapsae) @ 1.5 billion IJ/ha. Further, packaging with 60-80 micron polyethylene (LDPE) resulted in sustained higher survival (69.9%) of EPN, Steinernema carpocapsae up to 30 days in temperature regime of 25-27oC. Vegetable crops In cabbage, a module comprising foliar application of azadhiractin 0.03% @ 5ml/l, rynaxpyr 18.5 SC @ 0.15 ml/l, novaluron 10 EC @ 1.5ml/l, emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 0.35g/l at 10-15 days interval was highly effective with 88.43% reduction in DBM larvae and 69.64 % increase in marketable yield with cost : benefit ratio 1:8.68. Carbofuran@1kg, a.i./ha + copper oxychloride@0.25% + TRB4+CRB2 @1% was highly effective reducing galls by 64.5%, soil population 28.0% as well as disease severity scale to 1, gall index 3 and reproductive factor 0.2 over inoculated control where corresponding values were as 0.0, 0.0, and 3.5 and 7 and 1.3, respectively. This treatments also increased the plant height (41.3%), root length (47.7cm) and yield (77.5%) compared to inoculated control. Flonicamid 50 WG @ 0.4g/l was effective with 93.26 and 85.91% reduction in leafhoppers (Amrasca biguttula biguttula) and whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), respectively. Its residue dissipation followed first order kinetics with half-lives 3 - 3.5 days. The pre-harvest interval (PHI) was 16 and 20 days for recommended and double the recommended doses, respectively. The residues dissipated below MRL of 0.01 mg/kg on the same day. The dietary exposure of measured residues was lower than the MPI of 0.576 mg/person/day on all the sampling days for a single and double dose. A strain of Trichoderma asperellum inhibited the mycelial growth of Pythium aphanidermatum, P. debaryanum (causing damping off disease), Sclerotium rolfsii Sr1 and S.rolfsii Sr3 (causing collar rot disease) by 43.57, 38.16, 42.56 and 54.87% respectively after 6 days of its inoculation. It also inhibited the mycelia growth of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.lycopersici (causing wilt disease) and Alernaria solani (early blight disease) by 26.27 and 24.
