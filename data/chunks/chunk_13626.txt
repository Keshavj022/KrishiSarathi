 Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (a) Pre-monsoon season (b) Post-monsoon season. R. Anjum et al. Chemical Engineering Journal Advances 16 (2023) 100547 12 home to the Lock industry’s main industrial core [53]. At Ambedkar Park, which lies at the lowest elevation in the study area and sanitation and hygiene are issues that affect people’s daily lives at this area [54]. It was reported in some earlier cases that industrial carcinogenic wastes are being covertly or occasionally dumped into the bore holes that are no longer in use. Therefore, excessive groundwater uses and direct discharge into the ground may be a contributing factor [47]. Mulla para, which is close to the city’s landfill (A to Z solid waste department) and where sluggish drain water and a mountain of trash degrade the water quality throughout the area [53]. The Pratibha colony, which consists of a dense population and barren land that is useless during the PRM season, was where the extremely low water quality was observed. Only at Kali Deh was it discovered that the water’s physical characteristics were damaged. The neighborhood is close to numerous water bodies that maintain stagnant, dirty water throughout the year, as well as a pumping station that takes up a sizable area and pumps raw sewage continuously. Although overall water quality was higher than it was in PRM season (Fig. 7), poor water quality was noticed in POM season at Gandhi Eye Hospital, B.S.J. Hall, near Student Union Hall and Avas Vikas commu­ nity. With the exception of Avas Vikas community, all three locations are in the shallow-lying civil line sector; as a result, the percolation rate of rainwater is higher there, stimulating the aquifer and fusing impure surface waste water into the soil [55].
