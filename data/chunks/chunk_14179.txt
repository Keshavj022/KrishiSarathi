 Multicell panels including indeterminate leaf/culm panels from crops, and cut phytoliths were also recovered. Family-specific Cyperaceae phytoliths were also observed. The crop phytoliths include various millet, rice, wheat and barley type morpho­ types indicating some agricultural provenance. Iph−humidity are pre­ sented in Fig. 4. Phase I (200 BCE–500 CE) - Grass phytoliths dominate, ranging from 85 to 90%. GSSCs account for 45−52% with lower relative abundances bilobates (22−29%), cross (1.5−3%), saddles (8−10%), rondels (4−8%) and trapezoids (5–10%). The elongate psilate and elongate dendritic compose 5−8% and 8−9% respectively. Various crop phytoliths include millets, rice, barley, cut phytoliths range 17–20%. Cyperaceae phyto­ liths are highest in this zone, from 3 to 5%. The Humidity-aridity index or Iph% ranges 22−28%, the lowest in the record. Phase II (500–1300 CE) - This is dominated by grass phytoliths from 86 to 91%, the highest in the whole profile. The GSSCs range between 41 and 50%, including bilobates (17–19%), cross (2–4%), saddles (10–11%), trapezoids (4−6%) and rondels (4−6%). Psilate and den­ dritic elongate types account for 8−9% and 5%–6%. Total crop phyto­ liths account for 26−30%, while rice type phytoliths were highest in this zone (5−8%). An increase in millet phytoliths was observed. The Humidity-aridity index was 32%–35%, slightly higher than the pre­ ceding zone. Phase III (1300−1850 CE) - Grass phytoliths dominate as in Phases I & II (84−89%). GGSCs range from 35 to 39% including bilobates (12−16%), cross (2−5%), saddle (13−15%), rondels (2−4%) and trapezoid (3−4%) types. Elongates including psilate and dendritic types account for 8−12% and 4−5% respectively. Total crop phytoliths were highest in this zone (26−31%), especially millet types between 8 and Fig. 5.

Late Holocene climate in arid northwest South Asia At present, there are few high-resolution palaeoclimatic records covering the past 3000 years in northern Guajarat. Pollen from the three uppermost (15 cm) samples from a Pariyaj Lake core (Raj et al., 2015) have been interpreted as indicating dry, winter precipitation dominated conditions over the last 3500 years, while at Wadwhana Lake (Prasad et al., 2014) multiple proxies from the upper 20 cm of sediment dated ca. 700 BCE – 700 CE have been interpreted as indicators of a warm humid climate. Due to the low sampling resolution of these studies we approach these interpretations cautiously.
