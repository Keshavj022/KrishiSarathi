 Exploring the potential of Faba bean as a natural source of L-Dopa: Faba bean (Vicia faba ) is a good Antioxidant enzymes analysis showed that the activity of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase were higher in BKS 41 compared to Sadabahar indicating better scavenging capacity in the high zinc genotype under zinc- deficient conditions. Transcription factors bZIP19 and bZIP23 act as central regulators of Zn deficiency response in Arabidopsis. Therefore, the ortholog genes Os06t0601500-02 (bZIP 48) and Os06g0716800 (bZIP 53), and a zinc deficiency responsive Cu/Zn SOD gene (Os03g22810) were selected and validated through qRT-PCR. The expression profiling of zinc-responsive gene OsbZIP48, OsbZIP53 and Os03g22810 (Cu/Zn SOD) showed that OsbZIP48, which plays significant role in zinc homoeostasis, was significantly upregulated in BKS-41 root. The gene Os03g22810 (Cu/Zn SOD) showed significant upregulation in BKS-41 in shoot under zinc-deficient conditions. The contrasting yet differential gene expression of bZIP48 in root and shoot tissues in both genotypes pointed to the plausible role of this gene in tissue-specific Zn homeostasis under Zn deficit conditions. Analyzing the overall performance at the morpho-physiological level followed by higher activity of antioxidant enzymes and induction of gene OsbZIP48 in root tissue in genotype BKS 41 under zinc deprivation suggested its better zinc use efficiency. Molecular regulation of RFOs accumulation in Relative expression levels of Os06g0716800, OsbZIP48 and Os03g22810 were compared in the shoot (A) and root (B) after 1 week of treatment under Zn sufficient (+Zn) and Zn deficient (-Zn) condition. Note: All expression level were normalized with respect to endogenous control Actin, OsActin and all three genes Os06g0716800 (OsbZIP53), OsbZIP48 and Os03g22810 were determined by 2-ΔCT method. Bars represent mean fold change in the transcript level of three biological replicates ±SE. Effect of zinc deficiency on different root traits. BKS 41 (with higher seed Zn content) showed longer root and root hair zone with higher hair density. Crop Improvement icar annual report 2022-23 52 source of protein, vitamins, and other bioactive compounds like L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa). The different tissues of the crop have been reported to contain enough L-Dopa to be pharmacologically active on patients with Parkinson’s disease. The amount of L-Dopa may vary considerably, depending on the species, climate zone, soil conditions, precipitation and other factors. In the present study, four released varieties of faba bean, i.e. Swarna Suraksha, Swarna Safal, Swarna Gaurav and Pusa Sumeet were grown under controlled polyhouse conditions and evaluated for L-Dopa content. From 60-day old plants, fresh tissues, viz. young leaves, fully grown leaves, flowers, tender pods, and mature pods were used for the study.
