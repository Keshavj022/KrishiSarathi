 capsularis contained 32 tRNAs, while C. olitorius contained 34 tRNAs. A total of 620 and 644 ORFs were identified in C. capsularis and C. olitorius, respectively. Comparative mitogenomics between the two cultivated jute species revealed large-scale genomic rearrangements and their complex evolution. Seed technology Quality seed production: During 2015-16, 1.25, 1.49, 1.19, 1.28, and 0.37 lakh q of breeder, foundation, certified, truthfully labelled seeds and planting material, respectively, were produced. Further nearly, 272 lakh of planting material and 13 lakh tissue-cultured plants were produced during the year. - 11°Brix). Guava varieties, Arka Kiran and Arka Mridula, as female parents were observed to be cross compatible with wild species (Psidium guineense) with~75% fruit set. Advanced inter-generic hybrid progenies between Arka Surya × Visconcellea cauli- flora attained stability for broad leaf trait and fruit shape with field tolerance to PRSV. Pomegranate Hybrid -4/2 produces large reddish fruits (400g) with thin rind and soft, dark red, sweet (TSS 17.6°B) arils. Nagpur Mandarin Seedless-4 is a clonal selection, having attractive seedless fruits, 679 fruits/plant (98 kg/plant), 145 g fruit weight, TSS (10.44°Brix), acidity (0.72%) and juice (46.06%). It contains less than 2.57 seeds/fruit against standard check, ‘Nagpur Mandarin’ (12.68 seeds/fruit). Acid Lime -7 is high-yielding (195 kg/tree) variety (54 tonnes/ha) with high juice content (50.50%) and attractive fruit. Fruit weight is 48g with 8.45 seeds/fruit, acidity 7.05% and TSS 7.93%. Acid Lime 8 is very high (216 kg/tree) yielding (59 tonnes/ ha) and cluster bearing variety. Fruit weight is 50g and juice content 51.5%. The number of fruits/ cluster is 2 - 9. Average seeds/ fruit are 8.61, acidity 7.01% and total soluble solids 7.96%. NRCB-7 is a banana selection from the local culinary landrace, Bangrier (ABB, subgroup Bontha) with 15% higher yield (28- 30 kg/bunch) as compared to 22-25 kg in local check, Monthan with 10-12 tightly packed hands/bunch and elongate fruits (20-22 cm) with pointed tip. NRCB-8 banana is an exotic introduction of cv. Saba (ABB) with 30 kg/ bunch. The fruits are dark green and flattened with a blunt tip, suitable for both culinary and dessert Seed production scenario during 2015-16 Guava hybrid H-1314 Nagpur Mandarin Seedless 4 Horticulture Fruit crops Guava hybrid ‘H-1314’ (Purple Local × Allahabad Safeda); identified for table purpose, 300-325g fruits weight, firm and 1.6 - 1.8 cm thick white pulp, medium seed hardiness (10.0-10.5 kg/cm2) and good TSS (10 CROP IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 53 purposes. A hybrid progeny, No. 14, of the cross combination of Anaikomban (AA) × Pisang Jajee (AA), 250-270cm long and 80-95cm broad leaves with soft midrib and flexible leaf blade with good keeping quality (one week at room temperature) was observed suitable for leaf production. CISH-J-42 jamun is a seedless selection.
