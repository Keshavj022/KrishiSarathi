60975 This study 2022 Data fusion (Crop statistics, RPR, SRF) India Agricultural statistics at a glance 2018 & Horticulture statistics at a glance 2018, MOA, Govt. of India 28 (43) Sugarcane, Rice, Banana, Wheat, Mustard 869.11 288.14 crop residues. Also, there is a high need of research related to sup- ply chain management of different crop residue biomass available in different regions of India for efficient energy production. 6. Conclusion For 2017–18, a detailed estimation of major crop residue avail- ability as well as the potential for the production of bio syngas from the 43 crop residues produced from 28 different crops throughout the 36 distinct regions (28 states and 8 UTs) of India have been presented. Uttar Pradesh has the largest potential for producing surplus residues, with a potential of 57.72 MT. Sugarcane with 62.68 MT surplus crop residue potential ranks 1st nationwide. The potential for bioenergy from surplus crop residues was calculated to be 4.88 EJ, or around 12.67% of the primary energy used in the year 2017–18. The syngas production potential of India from surplus crop residue gasification was found to be 327.16 MT per year. Uttar Pradesh ranks 1st among all the regions in terms of syngas production potential. The national syngas gas energy potential is found to be 1.489 EJ which is 30.52% of the total bioenergy potential of India. The syngas production potential is also found to be 37.64% of the gross residue potential of India. Upgrading this amount of syngas through the MeOH synthesis process, 81.7905 MT of MeOH production is estimated, with an equivalent en- ergy content of 1.8566 EJ. The amount of surplus syngas and MeOH energy potential from the upgradation of the crop residue biomass. CRediT authorship contribution statement Tanmay J.
