 Excessive use of nitrogen generates expenses of between EUR 70 and 320 billion for the European Union due to its contribution to climate change and the loss of biodiversity. This expense is more than double the value of nitrogen fertilizers used on European farms [46]. 4. Nutritional Importance of Lentils Food scarcity causes nutritional deficiencies in humans, coupled with a deficient diet lacking macro- and micronutrients such as proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, resulting in protein malnutrition. Low-digestible carbohydrates, also called prebiotics, are substrates that microorganisms in the host’s digestive system use to confer health benefits [47]. Microorganisms in the human body comprise four main Phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinomycetes, and Proteobacteria. The Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio is an important parameter to reflect disturbances of the gut microbiota, which can cause disease [48]. The intestinal microbiota regulates nervous, endocrine, and immune system communication through the brain–gut connection, which affects the appearance and development of central nervous system diseases, especially Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases [49]. Additionally, metabolites produced by the microbiota, especially trimethylamine oxide, bile acids, and short-chain fatty acids, can induce the development of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis [50]. Finally, the gut microbiota has been associated with metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, as well as gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer [51]. A previous study in a rat model [52] reported the profile of prebiotic carbohydrates after removing protein and fats from the lentil seed (Figure 3). Among the simple sugars, su- crose was the most abundant (1.2–2.3 g/100 g), followed by glucose (21–61 mg/100 g), fruc- tose (0.2–21.9 mg/100 g), mannose (1.2–7.9 mg/100 g), and rhamnose (0.5–1.0 mg/100 g). Among sugar alcohols, sorbitol concentrations were the highest (0.6–0.7 g/100 g), followed by mannitol (9–31 mg/100 g) and xylitol (14–31 mg/100 g). In the case of the oligosac- charides of the raffinose family, stachyose was more abundant (2236–2348 mg/100 g) than raffinose (0.4–0.6 g/100 g) and verbascose (0.6–1.8 g/100 g). In contrast, lentils con- tain more kestose than nistose. Other prebiotic carbohydrates present were arabinose (2.4–2.6 g/100 g), xylose (1.9 g/100 g), and cellulose (0.6 g/100 g).

Due to lentils containing prebiotics, which serve as a substrate for microorganisms such as Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (whose ratio is an important parameter that reflects intestinal disturbances) present in the human intestine, the con- sumption of this legume protects against various diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.
