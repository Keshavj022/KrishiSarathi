The CO2 concentrations have increased significantly across the world after the industrialization. The anthropogenic provenance to the con- centration of CO2 needs immediate mitigative interventions. India is a global agricultural powerhouse and significantly contributing to the global CO2 levels. Here, we present the changes in CO2 concentrations between 2009 and 2020 in India with respect to agri- cultural activities. We also propose steps to reduce yield scaled soil emissions through agricultural management. The CO2 concentrations in India show a steady increase of about 2.42 ppm/year from 2009 to 2020. The Central India (CEI), Hilly (HIL) and Indo- Gangetic Plain (IGP) show a relatively higher increase of about 2.43 ppm/year during the period. The highest CO2 concentration is observed during zaid (March to May) season, whereas the lowest CO2 concentration is observed during kharif (June to September) season. Anthropogenic activities such as the high use of fossil fuels and biomass burning are the two factors that significantly affect concentrations and temporal trends of CO2 in India. A pilot-scale agricultural nutrient management experiment suggests that stable carbon alternatives like biochar can reduce soil CO2 emissions without losing grain yield in paddy.
