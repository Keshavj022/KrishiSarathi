 They have significant strengths in particular areas but they also have particular areas of lack which ultimately hinder their ability in the matter of predicting rainfall patterns in an accurate way. Hybrid approaches combine ANN and fuzzy logic and make a perfect solution which has been particularly effective in improving rainfall forecast accuracy [9]. Apart from the advantages, the main concern is that they require substantial computational resources. I. Prathibha, D. Leela Rani / IJCESEN 11-1(2025)313-319 315 Figure 1.

Kriging is an efficient technique of rainfall forecasting that allows researchers to estimate unknown rainfall values over regions based on known data points, generating detailed maps of rainfall variability [10]. 3.
