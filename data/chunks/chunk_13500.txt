 During 2004–2005, only two districts were classified into high irrigation intensity group, whereas the number increased to five districts during 2018–2019. This study highlighted the necessity for further empirical investigations and the adoption of a mixed-methods to gain a more comprehensive understanding. In conclusion, the research presents a thorough analysis of the intricate relationship between agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity in Karnataka. The findings provided valuable insights for policy-makers, researchers, and regional planners, aiming to enhance agricultural practices in the face of challenges. The nuanced understanding of the spatio-temporal variation of agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity contributes to informed decision-making, laying the groundwork for sustainable agricultural growth in the region. 5.2. Recommendations Therefore, to attain agricultural sustainability in Karnataka, it is recommended to prioritize the promotion of arid horticulture, implement a climate-smart integrated farming approach, choose suitable drought-tolerant seed varieties, adopt rainwater harvesting, and execute soil and water conservation measures through micro-watershed development. There is a need to ensure equitable distribution of irrigation facilities in districts of moderately high irrigation intensity, i.e., Dakshin Kannad, Shimoga, Bagalkot, Belgaum and Mandya districts. Moreover, the study area should introduce drip irrigation systems in districts grappling with water scarcity, such as Bidar, Kolar, Dharwad, Gadag, Kodagu, and Gulbarga districts. Special attention is warranted to the western coastal saline region, which is characterized by lower agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity compared to other districts. To bolster agricultural efficiency and augment water availability for irrigation, there is a need to actively promote rainwater harvesting initiatives in this region. To meet present demands, it is imperative to embrace sustainable farming practices, which involves prioritizing efficient irrigation methods such as utilizing surface water, constructing reservoirs with higher capacity water, conserving existing wetlands and water bodies, minimizing surface runoff and enhancing infiltration, promoting expanded rainwater harvesting, and encouraging mixed farming and diverse crop production. To achieve sustainable development of agriculture in Karnataka, there is a critical need to decrease the cultivation area devoted to paddy, particularly for summer rice. Shifting focus to the cultivation of pulses, oilseeds, fruits, and vegetables would to be a more economically and environmentally viable strategy for the agricultural sector in Karnataka. This research is pivotal for policy-makers to make decision for selecting crops for specific regions, improving irrigation efficiency, increasing crop production, and enhancing agricultural income.
