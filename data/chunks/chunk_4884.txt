 Through satellite imagery, it is possible to assess vegetation indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which indicates plant health. Drones, equipped with sensors, can further refine this data by capturing localized insights about soil moisture or crop stress. Geographic information systems (GIS) for spatial analysis: GIS technology integrates data from remote sensing and other sources to create visual, interactive maps of specific regions. These maps offer spatial insights into the environmental characteristics of an area, enabling users to identify patterns and relationships that are critical for crop suitability. By layering different datasets such as soil type, topography, rainfall, and temperature, GIS provides a detailed understanding of how these factors influence the growth potential of specific crops. Artificial intelligence for predictive modeling: This technology has brought a paradigm shift in crop suitability mapping by automating the analysis of complex environmental data. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms can process massive datasets, learn from historical data, and create predictive models. These models help forecast future conditions, optimize land use, and minimize risks in crop selection. In AI-driven crop suitability mapping, machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest or Neural Networks analyze variables like temperature, rainfall, and soil fertility to predict the best regions for specific crops. Deep learning models, particularly useful for image-based analysis, enhance the interpretation of satellite and drone data, identifying subtle patterns that may not be obvious through manual analysis. AI also has the capability to adapt to climate change by incorporating future weather scenarios into its predictions. This enables long-term planning and helps farmers adjust crop choices based on evolving environmental conditions. Role of AI in crop suitability mapping By harnessing the power of machine learning (ML), deep learning, and other AI technologies, now it is possible to develop highly accurate crop suitability maps. These tools excel at processing large amounts of data, One of the key applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in agriculture is crop suitability mapping, which helps farmers identify the best crops for specific geographic areas by analyzing factors like soil type, climate, and the topography. For horticultural crops, AI-driven crop suitability mapping offers a transformative way to optimize land use and promote sustainable agriculture. By combining Machine Learning (ML), Geographical Information System (GIS), and Remote Sensing (RS) technologies, AI tools can process complex environmental data such as soil characteristics, climatic conditions and terrain to demarcate the most suitable regions for growing fruits, vegetables, and flowers.
