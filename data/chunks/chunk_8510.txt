chilonis, each at 100,000 adults/ha/release/week, 3 times have been found effective in reducing rice leaf folder and stem borer infestations during kharif and rabi, and recorded maximum yields in Maharashtra, Assam and Punjab. Horticultural and plantation crops. In Solan, Chrysoperla carnea larvae for management of woolly apple aphids could be released safely after 10 days of treatment with Malathion (0.05%), 15 days with Endosulfan (0.05%) and 30 days with Profenophos (0.05%). Five sprays of HaNPV at 1.5 × 1012 POBs/ha at weekly interval, and 5 weekly releases of Trichogramma pretiosum at 50,000 adults/ha/release + 3 sprays of HaNPV at 1.5 × 1012 POBs/ha, when the first spray started 5 days after first release of parasitoid were most effective against tomato fruit borer in Maharashtra. In Punjab, releases of T. pretiosum (5 releases at weekly interval at 50,000/ha) + 3 sprays of HaNPV (1.5 × 1012 POBs/ha) + 3 sprays of Endosulfan (at 2.5 1itres/ha, at 15 days interval) proved most effective for managing fruit borer on tomato. In Bangalore, diamondback moth on cabbage could be managed either through release of T. bactrae at 50,000 adults/ha/release, 5 times at weekly interval, commencing 25 days after planting or spraying Delfin WG at 1 kg/ha 5 times at 10 days interval, starting from initiation of flowering. HONEY BEE RESEARCH Honey Bee Pollination In litchi, bees were predominant (75–95%) among the insects visiting the inflorescence. And among bees, Apis mellifera dominated (46%), followed by wild bees Apis dorsata (36.8%) and Apis florea (17.2%). Little bees Trigona iridipennis were found as occasional visitor. Peak activity of bees was observed in the forenoon. Little bees, Italian bees and rock bees had spent on an average 4.0, 2.9 and 2.6 seconds/flower. Fruit-setting in covered branch was 26.5/branch and in uncovered it was 64.4/branch. Bee visits were 17.03 bees/min./panicle in orchards where 45 bee-colonies were placed and were lowest (4.26 bee/min/panicle) in orchards without bee-colonies (control). Maximum fruit-set (2.1%) and fruit weight (22.35 g) were recorded where SUCCESSFUL IPM MODULE FOR COTTON Location-specific IPM for eco-friendly and sustainable cotton production has been evaluated at 15 locations (villages) in north, central and south cotton-growing zones, covering an area of 600 ha approximately. The proven IPM technologies being transferred to farmers include cotton leaf-curl resistant varieties/ hybrids, use of cover/trap crops and of critical eco-friendly inputs such as release of Trichogramma chilonis, HaNPV and neem-seed-kernel powder extract. The pesticide load in irrigated cotton-crop reduced to 8–10 sprays in Punjab and Haryana compared to 18–20 sprays in the non-IPM farmers' fields, and in rainfed cotton pesticide application was restricted to 3 sprays in IPM plots compared to 6–8 sprays in non-IPM plots.
