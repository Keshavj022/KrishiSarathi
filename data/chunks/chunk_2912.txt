 The idea is simple where one can publish paper in whatever journal but place the full text of the final accepted version in an open access repository so that any researcher with simple Internet access can find and read it. He further informed that the Indian Academy of Sciences will soon set up an open access repository that would make available the full texts of all papers published by all Fellows of the Academy past and present. ICRISAT 9 and NIIT-Rourkela have a mandate in place and all papers by their faculty and students will necessarily have to be deposited in their institutional repository. All AUs and ICAR institutes can also follow and the agriculture research sector be the first in India to have the record of 100% open access.
