 During boiling, starch gets gelatinized which reduces drying time significantly and also distributes colour uniformly throughout the rhizomes. It also facilitates the sterilization of materials keeping it free from insect infestation throughout the storage. Boiled rhizomes are sliced (4-5 mm thickness) into small pieces uniformly which reduces the drying time and is reported to improve the quality of final product. It is practiced by hand, using a knife or mechanically through specially designed vegetable cutter. A number of instruments are available in market and even CFTRI, Mysuru also developed slicer specially designed for turmeric slicing. Slicing can be done even before the boiling and then the sliced rhizome are boiled. Ultimately drying is done, and it is a critically Table 1.

Impact of quality parameters based on boiling types Boiling nature/type Quality parameters Steam pressure (15 mins hold at 20 psi) Minimum drying time (53.33 h) Steam pressure (5 mins hold at 15 psi) Maximum dry recovery (21.32%) Steam pressure (10 mins hold at 15 psi) Highest curcumin content (4.13%) Boiling (60 mins) Maximum retention of carbohydrates (53.15%), proteins (3.16%), fat (2.72%) and starch (49.14%) Boiling (45 mins) Maximum retention of curcumin (5.91%), essential oil (3.6%) and oleoresin (13.3%) and dried in 11 days Steam Higher retention of curcumin and oleoresin Boiling (30 mins) 18 h of drying time in cured turmeric but in non-cured turmeric took 108 h September–October 2023 43 Table 3. Impact of different drying techniques on quality parameters Type of dryer Preferable quality parameters Solar dryer Degraded curcuminoids by 36.5% and the anti-oxidant capacity value decreased by 14% Fluidized bed dryer (50-80°C) Took lowest drying time without affecting curcuminoids and the antioxidant capacity Hot-air dryer (70°C) Higher curcumin (2.97%) with less drying time Hot air dryer (60°C) Low moisture level (4.23%) with less water activity (0.256%) Solar tunnel dryer Retains maximum curcumin content Shade-net drying Maximum retention of curcumin and dry recovery rate rhizomes are spread in 5-7 cm thick layers (avoid thin layer because it impairs quality). During the night time, it should be heaped or covered to prevent from the moisture absorption. The final quality parameters and duration of drying (Table 3) are the matter and various researchers revealed the pros and cons of each drying techniques.
