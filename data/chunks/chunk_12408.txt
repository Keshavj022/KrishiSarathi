Crop Diversification, Intensification and Integrated Farming System (IFS) approaches (Integration of potential crops, animal and fishery) and advanced management practices like nutrient management and plant protection measures State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 140 Crops Strategies Action plan 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 Utilization of rice fallow lands for pulses like cowpea, green gram (Mung) & Ground nut (Area in hectares) Area expansion under paddy fallow lands 2000 5000 8000 10000 12000 Vegetables Introduction of varieties along with production and protection technologies (area in hectares) 50 100 150 200 250 High value Horticultural crops and spices Introduction of varieties along with production and protection technologies (area in hectares) 50 100 200 300 500 Creating models of IFS in farmer filed with different components (in numbers) IFS models in South and North Goa with best components 10 15 20 25 30 3. Production improvement in animal and fishery sector (I) Dairy sector A. Area expansion under green fodder production. Green fodder production Area expansion of green fodder cultivation through extension activities and schemes Advance technology like Hydroponic fodder for landless farmers Demonstration and establishing models in field B. Breeding policy. i. Introduction of exotic germplasm through AI not exceeding 50% genetic makeup ii. For high yielding, crossbred dairy cattle may be promoted but not exceeding exotic blood level more than 50%. Replacement of stock at least 10 % with units can improve the production. iii. Introduction and conservation of Indigenous breeds: In the scenario of climate change it is very much essential to identify and conserve local germplasm of cattle suited for State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 141 local coastal climate. Through selective breeding and purifying local breed development is essential.
