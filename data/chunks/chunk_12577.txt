Varieties: There are well established varieties of rice and other crops like, RC Maniphou 6, RC Maniphou 7, RC-Maniphou 10, RC Maniphou 11, RC Maniphou 12, and CAU R1 and newly released varieties like RC Maniphou 13, CAU R2, CAUR R3 and CAU R 4 are adapted under Manipur conditions. RC Maniphou 6 which a cross derivative of Ch 988 and IR 24 could thrive well under the upland and rainfed conditions. Similarly, for maize many hybrids like HQM series and composites like Pusa Composites and pre released Composite lines like RCM-1-64 are doing very well. North eastern region being the secondary origin of maize, there are possibilities of high value cash crops like, pop corn, sweet corn, baby corn varieties provided market and packaging links are created locally. There are already proven varieties of pulses through AICRP, but could not be released due the unawareness of the local State Variety Release system. It was decided to submit the release proposal process for release of all the suitable varieties by concerned AICRP Centres in CAU. As such for Arhar varieties like seeds can be made available by CAU & ICAR if indents by the state government is given on time (one year ahead as seed crop need to be raised).   Fix the procurement price at production cost plus 50 per cent to enable small farmers enough surpluses.   Animal and Fishery components are an integral part in any farming system. Dairy farming and poultry are important for organic source.   Revitalisation of state cattle breeding policy with selection in the progeny generation for crossbreeding/grading up programme. Low managerial skill of the dairy owner is critical, local agro-climatic conditions viz., temperature of Jersey breed is higher than place of origin; Jersey may be used as the prime/main improver breed to the selective local dairy cattle/cows. However, in resource rich areas, semen of Holstein- Friesian can also be utilised as another choice of breed.   Feed problem, particularly concentrates due to dependence from outside the region and high transport cost may be addressed to some extent by utilising locally produced ingredients like soybean, maize, rice bean, by-products of rapeseed, by-products of pulses, etc.
