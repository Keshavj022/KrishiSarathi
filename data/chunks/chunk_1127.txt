It is used as bird feed in the US, but is used for human consumption in many parts of the world including Russia, China, Korea and India. It is rich in protein and starch. The probable reason of proso millet in the first league of domesticated crops is its short-duration, minimum crop management, resilience to abiotic stress and being nutritionally rich. These could be the important attributes that also made proso millet spread over Asia and Europe.
