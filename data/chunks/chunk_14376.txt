Delving the influence of socio-economic, demographic and migration factors on utilization of remittances in the agricultural sector in a high out-migrating region in India Samrat Sarkar *, Reshmi R.S. Department of Migration and Urban Studies, International Institute of Population Sciences, Govandi Station Road, Deonar, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400088, India A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords: Out-migration Remittance Agriculture Rural Development Middle Ganga Plain A B S T R A C T In developing nations, remittances play a vital role in the development of the society. Remittances serve as a substantial income stream for rural households, empowering them to invest in farming activities, procure re­ sources, and enhance their overall quality of life. This study focuses on investigating remittance utilization patterns in agriculture and how do socio-economic, demographic and migration factors influence remittance utilization patterns in agriculture in the Middle Ganga Plain region (Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) of India? The study utilizes the data from the Middle Ganga Plain (MGP) migration survey (2021) conducted by the In­ ternational Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai. With the help of bivariate analysis, the study explores the relationship between socioeconomic and migration characteristics and the utilization of remittances in the agricultural sector. The Chi-Square test validates the findings, followed by a Binomial Logistic Regression Model for further analysis. The study reveals that marginalized social groups are more inclined to use remittances for agriculture due to their active involvement in agriculture.
