 (iv) Conservation of tillage operation: Pre‐planting tillage operations can be economized to the extent of 50% by using rotavator twice over conventional tillage in late planted sugarcane crop following wheat crop in light soils. (v) Management of weeds: Metribuzin @ 1.0 kg a.i. or ametryn @ 2.0 kg a.i./ha as pre‐emergence is as effective as earlier recommended pre‐emergence herbicide atrazine @ 2.0 kg.a.i./ha. Either of these herbicides should be coupled with application of 2, 4‐D @ 1.0 kg a.i./ha at 60 days after planting (DAP) and one hoeing at 90 DAP to sustain cane yield equivalent to three manual hoeings at 30, 60 & 90 DAP. III. Crop Protection technology: (i) Chemical control of smut disease : Dipping of setts (10 minutes) in carbendazim (0.2%) and triademephon (0.2%) was found effective in the management of smut and increasing cane yield. However, taking into economic consideration, carbendazim (0.2%) sett treatment was recommended. www.icar.org.in 93 2002 ‐ 2007 (ii) Integrated disease management (IDM) : IDM practices, viz., use of resistant variety, healthy seed of crop raised from heat treated seed cane, sett treatment with a systemic fungicide (carbendazim @ 0.2%), roguing of diseased plants, foliar spray of copper oxychloride (0.25%) and dithiocarbamate fungicides (0.25%) against foliar diseases may be adopted for higher germination and cane yield Chemical control of root borer: Soil drenching of imidacloprid @ 0.1 kg a.i./ha during mid‐August/120 days after planting be used for effective management of root borer. Management of sugarcane woolly aphid: For the effective management of sugarcane woolly aphid, the need based application of imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 100 g a.i./ha and thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 50.0 g a.i./ha followed by release of Dipha aphidivora and Micromus igorotus @ 2000 larvae/ha 15 days after chemical treatment may be practiced. Mass multiplication of Dipha aphidivora, the predator of sugarcane woolly aphid, may be carried out on sugarcane woolly aphid susceptible variety (e.g.,Co 86032, CoC 671) grown under green shade net. Woolly aphid may be released on the crop by continuous tagging of infested leaves till sizeable population is established. One hundred to two hundred larvae of Dipha may be released by tagging leaves. After 45‐60 days, larvae of Dipha may be harvested for redistribution. www.icar.org.in 94 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science All India Coordinated Research Project on Sunflower 1.
