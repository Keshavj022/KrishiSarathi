We produced 204.83 million metric tonnes of vegetables from an area of 11.35 million ha (2022-23, 3rd Estm). According to FAO (2021), India is the largest producer of ginger and okra among vegetables and ranks second in the production of Potato, Onion, Cauliflower, Brinjal, Cabbage, etc. India is 2nd largest producer of vegetables in the world and accounts for 15% of the world production but average productivity of 17 mt/ha is low in comparison to many other producing countries. Vegetables, being a rich source of many minerals, vitamins, dietary fibres, biochemical constituents are important for food, nutrition and health. According to the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) expert group report 2020, a daily healthy diet needs to include nearly 100 g of green leafy vegetables, 200 g of other vegetables and 100 g roots and tubers. More than 80% of Indians do not meet this recommendation and we are able to meet only around 1/9th of this requirement. The strong production base offers India, enormous opportunities for export. During 2021-22, our country exported fresh vegetables worth `5745.54 crores/ 767.01 USD Millions; processed vegetables (`3986.45 crores/ 534.
