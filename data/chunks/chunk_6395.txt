 A total of 24,950 sorghum germplasm accessions were sown and characterized for 24 agro-morphological traits which include 9 quantitative and 15 qualitative traits. Plant quarantine: A total of 1,26,704 imported samples were processed for quarantine clearance. Total 1,257 samples found infested/ infected with different pest, out of which 17 samples were rejected due to Exotic weed species, Bromus secalinus (a), Polygonum lapathifolium (b), Echinochloa crus-pavonis (c), Phalaris paradoxa (d), Polygonum cuspidatum (e) intercepted in imported germplasm. (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) GENETIC RESOURCES ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 53 substandard products, the Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee has included molecular identification and DNA fingerprint as mandatory requirement for registration of microbes as biopesticides. ICAR-National Bureau of Agriculturally Important Microorganisms has been recognized as the nodal agency for developing DNA fingerprints of microorganisms to be registered as biopesticides. More than 380 samples from 106 private companies and government organizations were processed to generate fingerprint and establish identity at the Bureau. The samples mainly contained Lecanicillium lecanii, Verticillium chlamydosporium, Purpureocillium lilacinum, Metarhizium anisopliae, Trichoderma harzianum, T. asperallum, Beauveria bassiana, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, B. thuringiensis, etc. Insects: DNA barcode for 127 insect species and Summary of trait specific germplasm registered during October 2022 to September 2023 with current status of donors registered by Plant Germplasm Registration Committee Crop group No. of germplasm entries registered Presents status Cereals and Pesudocereals 64 762 Millets 26 155 Fibre and Forages 05 130 Grain legumes 15 214 Vegetables 07 137 Oilseeds 12 258 Commercial crops 05 119 Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Spices and Masticatory 05 132 Fruits and Nuts 09 69 Tubers 02 56 Ornamentals 06 92 Narcotics 01 09 Agro-forestry 00 08 Total 157 2141 whole genome sequencing for 11 species including two insects, four Bt and 5 EPN strains were generated. Thirty three stage /age/ tissue specific transcriptomes (15 insects, and 18 EPN samples) were generated and analysed for the characterization of different genes and gene families. Important gene families of insects, EPNs and entomopathogenic microbes (Bt) were mined from the genome and transcriptome datasets and many novel genes were observed as a target for RNAi and genome editing. Plant germplasm registration: A total of 157 special trait germplasm/donor of 64 species were registered during the period of report taking the tally of total trait specific germplasm registered in the National Genebank to 1,775 for use in the trait based breeding by the scientists working in National Agricultural Research System.
