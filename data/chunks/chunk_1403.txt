 The farmers were also provided with improved breeds of piglets as well as feed to support partial nutrition requirements. The interventions received a good response from the participating farmers, who could earn ₹ 25,000-35,000 net annual profit per farm unit. Establishment of pig breeding unit Pig farming in the study area continue to have the issue of the availability of good quality piglets. This was primarily due of lack of farmers’ enthusiasm to take up pig farming for piglet production. Moreover, the outbreak of African swine flu coincided which with the lockdown due to COVID 19 pandemic which created apprehension about the availability of piglets and sustaining pig farming in the area. The FFP established two piglet production units in the Khamjongia cluster during 2020-21, and one unit in the Buruk Boruah cluster during 2022-23 to facilitate the production and availability of quality piglets for farmers in the Titabor development block. Dimension of the pig breeding unit Floor plan of the pig breeding unit Farmers were identified in the Khamjongia cluster based on the performance and experience after the FFP intervention in the area during 2016-17 to 2019-20 to enhance improved pig farming (Table 1).
