 Fisheries First record of fish and shrimp species: Identified a new freshwater fish species, Barilius torsai (Teleostei: Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae), from Torsa River, Brahmaputra drainage (DOI: https://doi.org/10.11609/ jott.4746.11.14.14808-14815). This fish is highly relished as food and fetches a high market price of ` 400–600/kg. Isolation and characterization of a heterotrophic ammonia oxidising bacteria: A new species of Pseudomonas was isolated and identified from the aquatic environment, and further confirmatory identification by 16S rRNA revealed that isolated bacteria belong to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sequence analysis using the NCBI BLAST showed 99% identity with P. aeruginosa. The isolated bacteria are capable of conducting heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification and are also having a good ability to remove ammonia and nitrate without nitrite formation in the media. Draft genome and associated genomics resources in Labeo catla: Accomplished de-novo genome assembly in Indian major carp, Labeo catla. Assembled genome size was 1.01 Gb against an in silico estimated Discovered for the first time, from Indian waters, three new species of marine ornamental shrimps, viz. Periclimenella agatti, Urocaridella arabianensis and Actinimenes koyaii from different islands of Lakshadweep. These species are new to science. Also discovered new distribution records of three marine ornamental shrimp species, viz. Thor hainanensis, Lysmata hochi and Urocaridella antonbruunii. Based on their ornamental value, attempts were made to breed three marine shrimp species, viz. P. agatti, U. arabianensis and L. hochi in captivity. Holotype of Barilius torsai (ZSI FF5542; 71.41 mm SL) Urocaridella arabianensis Periclimenella agatti Orthologous relationship between Labeo catla, Labeo rohita, Ctenopharyngodon idellus, Danio rerio and Anabarilius grahami genome size of 0.95 Gb, containing 5346 scaffolds (N50: 0.7 Gb; largest scaffold: 6.89 Mb). The evaluation of the genome revealed 92% complete, 87.9% complete and single copy, 4.1% complete and duplicated, 4.1% fragmented and 4.05% missing BUSCOs. The genome- wide simple sequence repeats were 391,331. Gene prediction revealed catla to contain 25,812 protein- coding genes. Orthologous relationships with diploid cyprinids such as Labeo rohita, Ctenopharyngodoni idellus, Danio rerio and Anabarilius grahami showed total of 8,494 orthologous gene clusters to be shared by all five species, with 1,357 species-specific gene clusters.
