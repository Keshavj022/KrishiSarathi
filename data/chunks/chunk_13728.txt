 tillage and weed control treatments are combined to form treatments; CT+H-ZT+H, conventional tillage combined with advised herbicides in corn and wheat; CT+IWM-CT+IWM, conventional tillage combined with integrated weed management in corn and wheat; CT+HW-CT+HW, conventional tillage combined with hand weeding in corn and wheat; CT+HW-CT+HW, conventional tillage combined with hand weeding in corn and wheat; and CT+H-IWM-CT+IWM, conventional Zero tillage in maize and wheat combined with recommended herbicides; conventional tillage in maize followed by zero tillage in wheat; integrated weed management in maize and wheat; conventional tillage in maize followed by zero tillage in wheat; hand weeding in maize and wheat; and ZT+H-ZT+H, zero tillage in maize and wheat combined with recommended Zero tillage in maize and wheat combined with hand weeding in maize and wheat; ZT+H-ZTR+H, zero tillage in maize followed by zero tillage+residue retention in wheat in combination with recommended herbicides in maize and wheat; ZT+IWM- ZTR+IWM, zero tillage in maize followed by zero tillage + residue retention in wheat in combination with recommended herbicides in maize and wheat; and ZT+HW-Z.

Phyto-sociology of winter season weeds Avena ludoviciana, Poa annua, and Lolium temulentum were the three weed species with the highest averaged total IVI values throughout the winter season among the seven (six annual and one perennial) weed species. (Table 5). The IVI average for Corono- pus didymus, however, was the lowest (15.66%) of all the weeds. Following CT+H-CT+H came ZTR+H-ZTR+H as the treatment plan with the greatest IVI for Avena ludoviciana. Nevertheless, Lolium temulentum had the highest IVI in CT+H-CT+H and CT+IWM-ZT +IWM. Phalaris minor had a higher IVI value in the experiments CT+H-ZT+H and ZT+H-ZT+H. However, ZT+IWM-ZTR+IWM and ZT +HW-ZTR+HW both produced the greatest IVI value for Daucus carota, respectively. 3.4. Weed diversity indices Thus, H’ is more inﬂuenced by the existence of ’scare’ species (Concenço et al., 2013). Higher values of the Shannon Wiener index (H’) reﬂect a larger diversity of species in an area. ZTR+H-ZTR+H recorded the highest pooled species richness (D) in the summer maize crop (2.07) and was followed by ZTR+IWM-ZTR+IWM (1.87). Shannon Wiener index and Shannon’s equitability/ Even- ness (EH) were higher for CT+HW-CT+HW followed by CT+H-CT +H. However, lower values of these indexes were associated with ZTR+H-ZTR+H (Table 6). The distribution of the occurrence of spon- taneous species in a population is primarily related to a higher val- ue of the diversity coefﬁcient. According to Correia and Durigan (2004), increased weed infestation is not a direct result of more di- versity.
