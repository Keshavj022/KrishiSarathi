In low lying and waterlogged areas, select MTU -1061, MTU-1064, RGL-2537 and MTU 1140. yy Summer ploughing reduces pest and disease build up yy Direct seeding (ferti cum seed drill or wet direct seeding with drum seeder) at 20 kg/acre seed rate, SRI cultivation or MSRI at 2-10 kg seed rate reduces seed and labour requirement, saves water. Machine transplanting to improve productivity with minimum labour. yy Grow green manure crops (Dhaincha, Sunhemp, Pillipesara and Cowpea) as preceding crop to Paddy and apply soil test-based fertilizers yy In case of non-availability or delayed supply of seed, farmers may use their own seed after ensuring germination percentage and increase the seed quantity accordingly. yy Dry seed treatment with Carbendazim @ 3.0 g/kg or wet seed treatment with 1.0 g/l/kg seed to prevent seed borne diseases. yy Soaking of seeds in nitric acid @ 6.3 ml/l of water for about 24 hours before sowing to break the seed dormancy in kharif paddy. yy Apply 4.50+6.25+1.6 kg of Urea, SSP and MoP for 5 cents of paddy nursery yy Spray Zinc Sulphate @ 2.0 g/l of water twice at 5 - 7 days interval to manage Zinc deficiency in nursery. yy Apply Carbofuran 3 G granules @ 160 g /cent at 7 to 10 days before pulling of seedlings to prevent stem borer, gall midge and leaf folder in main filed. 186 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy Transplant @ 44 hills/m2 to prevent yield loss due to aged seedlings yy Apply Blue Green Algae, Azolla, Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria and reduce 10-20 % of Nitrogen and Phosphorus fertilizer requirement. yy Fertilizer dose: 78:150:40 kg. Urea in three splits, SSP as basal and MoP in two splits yy Spray zinc sulphate @ 2.0 g/l, two to three times at 5 days interval to correct zinc deficiency yy Under submergence, drain excess water at the earliest and apply 20:10 kg N and K /ha. Fill the gaps with available nursery or splitting the surviving tillers. yy Cultivate sorghum, finger millet, foxtail millet, maize, pigeonpea, blackgram and greengram etc. under rainfed / protective irrigation conditions. yy In the absence of canal water release, cultivate pigeon pea / greengram / green manure - blackgram/ foxtail millet - chickpea / blackgram / maize / fodder maize. Cotton yy Sow during June to mid-July in red soils and July to mid-August in black soils. Avoid light red soils without irrigation facilities. yy Seed rate: 0.75 to 1.0 kg/acre for Bt.
