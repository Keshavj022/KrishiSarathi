Urfels et al. Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103618 4 the remainder we used values as reported by the Indian Government for the state of Bihar for machinery (rice: 221.82 $PPP ha−1, wheat: 327.96 $PPP ha−1), seed (rice: 178.67 $PPP ha−1, wheat: 178.67 INR ha−1), and hired labor (wheat: 251.05 $PPP ha−1, rice: 525.80 $PPP ha−1) as our dataset did not include this information (CACP: Cost of Cultivation Report 2017) (Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, 2017a, 2017b). For irrigation cost, we first treated irrigation as free (i.e., fully subsidized) and then conducted a sensitivity analysis that accounts for the different types of typical irrigation systems and associated costs as described at the end of this section. In addition, we compared the FPDIs that account for the net value of production with cash incomes by multiplying FPDIs with the self-reported marketed share of production and explored daily calories per capita retained by households. We further present the self-reported share of agricultural income in total household income as well as the surveyed crop’s share of agricultural income. 2.2.3. Irrigation, yield, and daily incomes We assessed how yields and daily incomes differ across the rainfed- fully irrigated spectrum. Here, our goal was not to isolate the causal effect of irrigation frequency on yields and daily incomes, but to identify realistic yield and daily incomes that farmers may obtain for different levels of irrigation intensity based on the observations in our dataset. Given the limitations of our costs data, we further ensure the robustness of our results by contextualizing our findings through investigations of gross value of production, profit ha−1 values from the literature and relating these two to the IBI values of the farms in our dataset. We then contrasted the profitability of the rice-wheat system for farms of low and high irrigation intensities by separating households into groups of low and high irrigation based on the range of irrigation intensities observed in the region (see Table 1). That is, < 3 irrigations in rice (28%) and wheat (63%) each for the low group and >3 irrigations in rice (44%) and >2 irrigations in wheat (36%) for the high irrigation group. Due to the lack of panel data, we summed the rice and wheat distributions for each group to assess the overall system benefits. We further present results of a random forest model that serves to explore average trends and vari­ ability in yields and daily profits associated with different irrigation frequencies in our dataset (Biau and Scornet, 2016; Breiman, 2001).
