Clinical examination for degree of dehydration, body temperature, heart rate, pulse rate, body weight of the individual animals was undertaken both before treatment and on day 6 after treatment. For hematological examination, blood samples were collected before and day 60 after treatment. Serum was prepared for estimation of local serum protein. The effect of various treatments on heart rate, pulse rate, body temperature, degree of dehydration, heamoglobin, serum protein and packed cell volume, total erythrocyte count, eggs per gram feaces was statistically analysed. For non-parasitic diarrhoea, four treatments were considered on the basis of number of days required for effecting complete cure. In group T1B, 2_7 days are required with an average of 2.83ą0.83 days. Group T2B required 1_2 days with an average of 1.17ą0.16 days. Group T3B required 1_2 days with an average of 1.5ą0.22 days. Group T4B required 2_4 days with an average of 2.83ą 0.30 days (Table 4). Parasitic diarrhoea was attributed mainly to roundworm infestation with Trichuris spp, Strongyles spp. and Haemonchus spp. Number of days required for complete recovery in animal of group T1A was 5.33ą1.05 days, group T2A 1.17ą0.16 days, group T3A 2.67ą0.88 days and group T4A 2.17ą0.47 days. Conclusion Takla flower juice and showed moderate degree of effectiveness against parasitic diarrhoea in goats without any anthelmentic action.
