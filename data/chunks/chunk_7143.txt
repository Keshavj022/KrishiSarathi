 The total input energy in wheat production after adopting roto-till drill (21.1 GJ/ha) is about 39% lower as compared to conventional practices (34.9 GJ/ha). The carbon emission in roto-till drill is 1,670 kg of equivalent C/ha which is 9% less in comparison to conventional practice (1,834 kg of equivalent C/ha). MECHANIZATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 99 Small tractor operated EPN applicator EPN (Entomo-pathogenic nematodes) application is recommended to manage white grub in sugarcane crop. At present, farmers follow spot application method which involves making 125 mm deep holes using crowbar and followed by dropping the EPN solution manually to control white grub. This results in non-uniform quantity of EPN solution in sugarcane root zones. Therefore, a small tractor (13.4–17.9 kW) operated EPN applicator was developed to reduce the drudgery of workers and uniform application of EPN solution. The 150 l capacity tank consists of an agitator and two outlets for EPN solution. The speed of the agitator shaft and discharge rate can be adjusted using control units. It applies EPN solution at the rate of 30–32 Infective juveniles/ml (IJs/ ml) from each outlets at root zone of sugarcane crop to control white grub and has an effective field capacity of 0.18 ha/h. The cost of operation of the equipment is ` 2,550/ha, and results in cost saving of 47% as compared to manual method. Integrated system for harvesting and conveying of bunch crops A tractor operated integrated harvesting-cum- conveying machine having cutter bar width of 2,120 mm was developed. It is a modified vertical conveyor reaper with an integrated conveying system for conveying cut crop to a collection box/trailer. The machine was evaluated for harvesting of soybean, black gram and green gram crops. The average height of cut, effective field capacity and field efficiency of machine are 66–80 mm, 0.25 ha/h and 78%, respectively, at 1.5 km/h forward speed. The harvesting losses are 1.5–2.9% for soybean, black-gram and green-gram crops. The estimated cost of the machine is `1.00 lakh and cost of operation is `711/h. The integrated harvesting-cum-conveying system can give economic benefit and time saving of 49 and 60%, respectively, as comparison to manual harvesting of bunch crops by sickle. Paper-tape vegetable transplanter A tractor-operated multi-row paper-tape vegetable transplanter was developed to save on labor, time and cost in vegetable production. It is a 6 row transplanting machine mounted on 3-point linkage of tractor. The row spacing of the machine can be adjusted with a minimum limit of 30 cm and six rows can be planted in one pass. It can be operated using a 24 HP tractor at a forward speed of 2.1 km/h. The row to row and plant to plant spacing was 30 and 16 cm respectively. The field capacity of the transplanter was 0.25 ha/h and fuel consumption of 2.8 l/h. The tilted planting percentage was 3.14%.
