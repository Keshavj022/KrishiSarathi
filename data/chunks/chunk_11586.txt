 sponsored programmes, (i) Weekly Iron Folic Acid Supplementation (WIFS) programme for school adolescent boys and girls (10- 19 years) and out of school girls (10–19 years) in urban and rural areas, and (ii) Vitamin-A Supplementation (VAS) programme for children under five, are in place India. • Dietary diversification: It is a process of including diverse cereals, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables and fruits in the diet in order to enhance the nutritional status. • Crop biofortification: It is a process of enhancing the nutritional quality of edible parts of the plants through genetic approach such as plant breeding. For example, (i) iron and zinc rich wheat grains, (ii) protein and zinc rich rice grains, and (iii) vitamin-A rich maize grains. Merits of biofortification: • It is regarded as the most sustainable approach to alleviate malnutrition. • It provides nutrients in natural form, thus nutrients enter the body as part of natural food matrix. • People can afford the ‘biofortified food’ as it does not involve any additional price. • ‘Biofortified varieties’ are as high yielding as ‘traditional varieties’, thus no loss is incurred to the farmers. • It does not require elaborate infrastructure facility as required in ‘food fortification’. • It does not need elaborate distribution system as required in ‘medical supplementation’. • It does not involve additional cost on preparing the enriched food grains. Why biofortification?
