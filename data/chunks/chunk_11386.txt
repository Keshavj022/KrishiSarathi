Field should be deep ploughed once with disc plough, subsequently 2-3 times ploughing with the help of cultivator and harrow Manure & fertilizers: FYM @ 10-15 ton/ha, bio-fertilizers like azotobacter and PSB culture @ 5kg/ha, 250 kg gypsum, 90 kg N: 40 P: 30 kg K and 10 kg ZnSO4 recommended, full dose of phosphorus and potash, one third dose of nitrogen should be applied before sowing during the field preparation and remaining nitrogenous fertilizer should be applied in two split doses; first dose apply one month later of sowing or transplanting and remaining second dose apply at flowering stage with the light irrigation. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 100 Soil treatment: Soil application of Trichoderma viridae @ 2.5 kg / ha mixed with 100 kg FYM or 250 kg castor cake or 250 kg Neem cake before sowing. Recommended Seed rate and sowing: 8-10 kg seed/ha for direct seeding and 1.5-2 kg in nursery for one ha area transplanting is sufficient. In direct seeding First week of October best for sowing of this crop. Row to row distance of 40-45 cm and Plant to plant distance of 15-20 cm should have kept in direct seeding method. Seed treatment: Advised to Seed treatment with Trichoderma @ 10g/kg seed or carbendazim 2g/kg seed for the management of fungal diseases, also advised to seed treatment with Imidacloprid 70 WP @ 7.5g/kg seed to manage the sucking insects like aphids, thrips etc. Nursery management: An area of 100 m2 is sufficient for one ha transplanting, beds of 2x3 m prepared and incorporate 15-20 FYM, 2 kg DAP, 500 g urea and 500 g folidol powder per bed, seed should be shown in 20 cm row to row distance during the 15th of July to 15th August; transplanting should be done after 45 to 60 days. Irrigation: Light irrigation should be applied just after sowing or transplanting and thereafter 6-8 irrigations should be applied at 15- 25 daysâ€™ interval. At flowering and seed formation stage irrigation must be necessary for getting higher yield. Interculture operations: Two interculture (hoeing and weeding) operations required; first interculture at 25-30 DAS and 60 days after sowing or transplanting, thinning should be practiced at the time of first interculture if required. Plant protection measures: Growing castor or marigold as a trap crop for the management of Spodoptera. Plant tall border crops like maize, sorghum for the management of mites, aphid, and thrips.
