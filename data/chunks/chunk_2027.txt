 The region has a sub-tropical climate; hence, the minimum and the maximum temperatures often range from 4 ◦C (winter) to 45 ◦C (summer). The annual rainfall of Karnal is around 70 cm with a vapour pressure of 7 to 25 mmHg. Seasons were classified as winter (December to March), summer (April to June), rainy (July–August) and autumn (September to November). The dry and wet bulb thermometer readings will be recorded regularly at the respective milking parlour of each breed. The temperature-humidity index was calculated using “THI= 0.72(Tdb + Twb) + 40.6, where Tdb = Dry bulb temperature in ◦C and Twb= Wet bulb temperature in ◦C" (McDowell, 1972). The month-wise analysis of the udder thermograms (USST) of experimental Sahiwal cows revealed a significant difference (p < 0.01) between the mean values of USST of SCM and CM-affected quarters compared to healthy quarters. During January, the mean values of USST showed an increase of 1.82 and 3.11 ◦C among SCM and CM-affected quarters compared to healthy quarters, respectively. Similarly, during February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December, the mean values of USST showed an increase of 1.37 and 2.35 ◦C, 0.96 and 2.09 ◦C, 0.79 and 1.66 ◦C, 1.21 and 2.21 ◦C, 0.76 and 1.34 ◦C, 1.04 and 1.78 ◦C, 0.73 and 1.49 ◦C, 1.71 and 2.70 ◦C, 1.01 and 2.06 ◦C, 1.27 and 2.47 ◦C¸1.81 and 2.76 ◦C, among SCM and CM affected quarters compared to healthy quarters, respectively. Compared to healthy quarters, the highest increment in USST was observed during January in the SCM and CM-affected quarters. The lowest increment in temperature was observed during August for SCM compared to healthy quarters and June for CM compared to healthy quarters. Within the USST of healthy quarters of Sahiwal cows, the mean values were significant (p < 0.01) between the months except for October– November and August–April, and their mean values were comparable among themselves but showed a significant difference (p < 0.01) from the mean values of other months. In the case of USST of SCM quarters, the mean values differed significantly (p < 0.01) during different months except for February–March, April–May, and September–October and their mean values were comparable but showed significant differences (p < 0.01) with other months of SCM quarters. Similarly, the mean values of the udder thermograms of the CM quarters of Sahiwal cows showed significant differences (p < 0.01) among the different months and were comparable between February–March, August–April, May–June, and September–October but showed a significant difference (p < 0.01) between other months. A similar pattern was observed in the teat skin surface temperature of the Sahiwal cows. Similarly, seasonal assessments of mastitis using thermal image analysis were carried out in Tharparkar, Gir, HFCB, and Murrah buffalo cows. The developed DL-CNN model had training and validation accuracy of (normal vs. clinical) to the tune of 0.96 and 0.
