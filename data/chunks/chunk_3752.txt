 Influence of minimum temperature is more spectacular affecting growth and yields, while higher maximum temperatures experienced in Andhra Pradesh did not show any detrimental effect under irrigated conditions. Prolonged cooler conditions affect the growth as the optimal mean temperature under controlled condition was found as 27 0C. Low temperature slows down the palm growth and leaf production considerably and increase male inflorescences. Though the crop can withstand three-month dry period, continued moisture stress drastically affects the palm growth and reduces yield. Very low levels of RH (<60%) for a prolonged period of more than 3 months a year reduces yield performance considerably. Deep soils with friable structure are more suitable for oil palm and a minimum of 75 cm soil depth is more preferred. To evaluate individual site, it needs to consider all the factors that influence oil palm production throughout its economic life. This is possible through an expert system viz., “Oil Palm Site Suitability Evaluator” (OPSSE) developed by ICAR- IIOPR which is available both for computer as well as mobile applications. It is available for free download from Google Play store for android based mobile application. Planting in main field The high rainfall in hill slopes causes soil erosion and runoff, loss of nutrients and fertile top soil. In Malaysia, many of the plantations are located in hill slopes also. The management practices need to be altered to suit to K Suresh1* and K Manorama2 Potential area and cultivable area under Oil Palm in NER State Potential area (ha) Cultivated Area (ha) as on 2023 Arunachal Pradesh 133,811 5,677 Assam 375,428 2,496 Meghalaya 122,637 0 Mizoram 66,792 26,832 Nagaland 51,297 7,801 Tripura 146,364 530 Manipur 66,652 171 Total 962,981 43,507 November–December 2023 93 the lands on hill slopes. Depending upon the degree of slope, the method of planting needs modification. If slope is <12% (0 to 6 0), no limitation for oil palm cultivation. If the slope is between 12 to 23% (6 to 120), circular plat forms or half-moon terracing is required to grow the crop and at the slope of 23 to 38% (12 to 200), crop can be grown only on bench terraces. If the slope exceeds 38% (200), it is not recommended to grow oil palm. The land at lower elevations may be covered first and then ventured to higher elevations if necessary. In general, oil palm is planted at a distance of 9 m hexagonal geometry, which can be achieved by maintaining a spacing of 7.8 m between rows and 9 m within a row. Square planting of oil palm at 9 m also is in practice which facilitates easy maneuvering with intercrops. However, there is a reduction in number of palms (oil palm) in square method (123 palms/ha) to the tune of 14% when compared with equilateral triangular method (143 palms/ha). On bench terraces, the distance between the mid points of two successive terraces should be 7.8 m and the distance between plant to plant is to be 9 m.
