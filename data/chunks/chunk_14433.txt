 Spatio-temporal trends in emissions from agricultural residue burning from 2011 to 2020 In India, total CO2e emissions from CRB have almost doubled since 2011, increasing from approximately 19,340 Gg.yr−1 to 33,834 Gg.yr−1 (Table 2).CRB in India is found to be responsible for releasing 9233 Gg carbon content in 2020, which is 75 % more than the base year 2011, which was 5278 Gg. The total emissions of CO for the base year 2011 are found to be 1121 Gg which rose to 1960 Gg in 2020, respectively. For the three GHGs, CO2, CH4, and N2O, emissions are 17,441 Gg, 64 Gg, and 1 Gg in 2011, which increased to 30,465 Gg, 112 Gg, and 2 Gg in 2020, respectively. Fig. 2(c) gives an overview of the spatial distribution of CO2e emis­ sions (in Gg.yr−1) over 602 districts across India. Table S4 provides the details of the seasonal emissions for pollutants, and Table S5 details crop-wise emissions. The Kharif and Rabi seasons accounted for 96 % of the total emissions in 2011, decreasing to 92 % in 2020 due to an Fig. 4.

Science of the Total Environment 904 (2023) 166944 9 increase in the contribution of emissions from the Summer season. The Summer season's contribution rose from 2 % in 2011 to 8 % in 2020. Interestingly, for the same period, emissions from Autumn and Winter have reduced significantly, dropping from 4.76 Gg and 12.66 Gg to 0.37 Gg and 4.59 Gg, respectively. In 2011, rice residues contributed to 56 % (2971 Gg of CC, with 9805 Gg, 631 Gg., 36 Gg, and 0.60 Gg from CO2, CO, CH4, and N2O, respectively) of total emissions, out of which 94 % is emitted from Kharif season burning and only 3 % is emitted due to Rabi burning. This contribution changed to 97 % and 2 %, respectively, in 2020. In contrast, the Rabi season is responsible for 100 % of emissions from wheat for all years, as this crop is not cultivated in any other season. Maize, the crop that is the third largest contributor to emissions, emitted 91 % (Table S4) of its total 2020 emissions due to the burning of Summer season residues, which increased from 31 % in 2011. Regarding state-wise contributions (Fig. 5), Punjab and Madhya Pradesh are the biggest contributors to emissions, with 54 % and 15 % of total India- wide emissions in 2011, which changed to 45 % and 28 % in 2020, respectively. Madhya Pradesh has dominated the quantity of emissions during the Rabi season, with significant contributions from wheat res­ idue burning.
