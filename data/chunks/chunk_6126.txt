477 when the linear model was validated with the rainfall data measured from the experimental sites, which is very nearer to the theoretical correction factor. A positive correlation was observed with the rainfall measured by both indigenous and standard rain- gauges, with high coefficient of determination, R2= 0.92 (Fig. 3). The quantity of rainfall received from indigenous rain-gauge and the operations carried out by the farmers of the surrounding fields were recorded. Operations performed in relation to depth of rain water received in indigenous rain-gauge On-station trial Sorghum+pigeonpea Sorghum + pigeonpea were sown by 50-100% farmers in 3 days when the indigenous rain-gauge was filled to >3/4 capacity or more in the research station as the fields were kept ready by ploughing Table 1.

Of all the 3 years, the rainfall received in indigenous rain-gauge during 2004 when multiplied with the correction factor of 0.48 came nearer to the rainfall recorded from standard rain- gauge emphasizing the improvement in indigenous rain-gauge as well as its nearness to the water requirement for sowing operation, which is about 12 mm when the fields are ploughed and 20 mm for both tillage and sowing. Castor Castor was sown mostly at the same time of the sowing of sorghum+pigeonpea as the fields were kept ready with primary tillage and mechanization made it possible to complete the sowing at a single stretch. Castor was sown for 1-3 days when the indigenous rain-gauge was up to >3/4 capacity, leading to 100% sowings (Table 2). On-farm trials Sorghum +pigeonpea Sorghum+ pigeonpea were sown in 2-7 days by the farmers, leading to 100% sowings with rain-water filling to 1/2â€”>3/4th capacity of the indigenous rain-gauge. This might have happened due to the fear of losing the season for sorghum Table 2.
