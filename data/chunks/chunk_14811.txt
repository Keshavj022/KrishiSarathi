A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords: Climate change impact Drought risk assessment A B S T R A C T Extreme dry and hot conditions lead to intense droughts in central India. However, the precise changes in future drought characteristics and their consequences on crop production have not been fully examined in Godavari River Basin.
