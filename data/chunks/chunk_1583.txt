 Synchronizing efforts to increase the productivity of millets with development of processing and value- addition processes and technologies can create huge market opportunities. This will provide enhanced farm income and create off-farm employment especially in the semi-arid tropical millet growing regions in India. Although the popularization efforts in International Year of Millets (2023) raised the awareness of millet benefits, it lead to paradox of higher prices paid by consumer and low price realization for farmer. Though the reasons for this may be many, some can be addressed through engineering interventions to maintain consistent quality of supplied grain, suitable processing machines and enhancing shelf-life of millet flours. Groundnut: Groundnut is a major oilseed crop of India and is pivotal for its oilseed economy. Groundnut has multiple uses. Major one is edible oil extraction. Groundnut oil is a preferred cooking oil of many regions of India. Deoiled cake is either used as feed or can be converted into foods. The sale of nuts in roasted form is low end application followed by packed and branded raw and roasted, conversion to confectionary items. High end products could be peanut butter, peanut paneer etc. However, there are many intermediaries in its supply chain and farmers usually do not get premium returns. This is ideally suited for value chain model with farmer producing organization making value-added products and building brand to reap higher profits. SUMMARY There is urgent need to implement several strategies to build robust value chains of rainfed agriculture produce. Small farm appropriate mechanization of pre-harvest agricultural activities and automated post-harvest management besides value-addition activities must be adopted. Infrastructure development is crucial, with a focus on establishing decentralized agro-processing units and cold storage facilities near production sites to reduce post-harvest losses and improve market access. Capacity building initiatives should train farmers in value-addition techniques and quality standards, empowering them to enhance the marketability of their produce. Policy support is essential, promoting crop insurance schemes, weather-based risk management tools, and access to institutional credit to mitigate risks associated with climate variability. Additionally, private sector engagement through public-private partnerships can attract investments in agro-processing, further strengthening value chains. Finally, adopting sustainable practices such as organic farming and integrated farming systems will improve ecological resilience, ensuring long-term productivity and environmental sustainability in rainfed agriculture. The concerted efforts in above manner will make rainfed agriculture more efficient, sustainable, and competitive. *Corresponding author email: knarsan@gmail.
