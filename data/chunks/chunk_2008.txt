Smooth convergence can be noticed, which implies the usage of NRMSE over other statistical measures, such as R2. The usage of NRMSE over R2 for selecting the optimal AL was proposed in many earlier works. The addition of a new sample at each iteration of the AL technique causes a stable decrease in RMSE and an increase in R2 when validating with the field dataset. Optimal GPR model performance was achieved by a set of a few samples, i.e., 97 and 119 for LAI and CCC, respectively. On adding new samples, the NRMSE of RSAL decreases from 80.76 to 16.84 for LAI. In the case of CCC, the NRMSE of EBD shows a steady decrease from 21.6 to 19.42 for CCC. RSAL outperformed other AL techniques for LAI, while Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report Table 3.
