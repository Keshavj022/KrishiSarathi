A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords: Vulnerability assessment Adaptation planning CRIDA Stress testing Lower Bhavani Irrigation Project A B S T R A C T The global discourse on climate change adaptation in various sectors has largely taken a top-down approach. However, impact analysis based on top-down approach with uncertainties at every stage of the process may lead to poor adaptation responses and hence there is a need for an alternative to this conventional approach. This study aims to implement a bottom-up, risk-based approach to vulnerability assessment in the agriculture sector, by adapting the Climate Risk Informed Decision Analysis (CRIDA) approach. This paper explains the risks that climate variability and change pose to the agricultural system, with Lower Bhavani Irrigation Project in the South India as a case study. The climate stressors of aridity index and climate variability were incremented or perturbed to develop different future climate scenarios, and the changes in paddy yield and supply–demand ratio were examined.
