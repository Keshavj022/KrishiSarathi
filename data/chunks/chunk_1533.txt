 Pearl millet (BJ 104) ratooned at 5 weeks stage gave 155 q/ha green forage and 8.5 q/ha grain yield as against 10.5 q/ha grain yield under without ratooning. Similar results have also been obtained in case of sorghum and maize. Alley cropping: Under rainfed conditions, alley cropping is an important alternate land use system Table 1.

In alley cropping system of grain sorghum with shrubs viz. Sesbania and Leucaena in row ratios of 6:1, 9:1 and 12:1, alley species produced 4 to 13 and 64 to 107 q/ha green forage in addition to maintaining the grain production of sorghum. Higher grain and stover yield of sorghum was obtained in alleys followed by farm boundary plantation and no trees association. Association of perennial grass and legume bushes Suitable ideotypes of perennial grass and forage- legume components reduces the necessity of repeated sowing and tillage, and economise on irrigation water use. In this system, an erect, leafy and compact BxN hybrid / guinea grass or trispecific hybrid and subabul or sesbania are grown together in alternate paired rows (2:2). These crops yields around 200 tonnes of nutritious green forage/ha/year. Such systems are less sensitive to fluctuations in soil moisture and are more suited to southern regions where both components grow throughout the year. The component crops of the system can be changed depending on input availability and yield indices of the crops in a region. Similarly, cultural management practices like crop geometry, spacing and planting patterns could be adjusted to facilitate appropriate farm machinery and effective utilization of irrigation water. Grasslands and alternate land use system Grazing based livestock husbandry continues to be important as around 50% animals depend on grazing spread over 12 mha. Grasses are suitable for soil and water conservation with quick reproduction by tillering and able to withstand grazing/mowing and harsh environments. The choice of suitable species vary with agro-climatic conditions.
