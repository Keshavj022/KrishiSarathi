 This is not the example of first study using ML, several studies have previously explored the use of ML models in the context of crop recommendation and yield prediction, each achieving varying levels of accuracy. For instance [44], SVM and DT models demonstrated accuracy rates of 91.73 % and 85.07 %, respectively. Another study [51], focused on smart farming and incorporated an intelligent insecticide and fertilizer recommendation system. This study achieved an accuracy of 78 % for SVM and 75 % for KNN models. Similarly, in Ref. [52] crop prediction was addressed by employing various feature selection techniques and machine learning classifiers. The study achieved noteworthy acÂ­ curacy rates of 97 %, 90.6 %, and 88.83 % for RF, KNN, and SVM models, respectively. This was accomplished by selecting 8 attributes out of the total 15 using recursive feature elimination. Additionally [32], applied machine learning techniques to predict crops and reported accuracy performance ranging from 98.2 % to 88.5 % for the multilayer perceptron and JRip classifier. Another study [53] utilized random forest for sugarcane yield prediction, implementing forward feature selection and attaining an accuracy rate of 72 %. Furthermore [54], applied data mining techniques to recommend the planting of various crops in Bangladesh, utilizing both KNN and ANN models with impressive accuracy levels ranging from 90 % to 95 %. These findings are consistent with the results of other studies in the field, indicating that machine learning models hold promise for accurate crop recommendation and yield prediction. In this study, we have also observed higher prediction performance, aligning with the trends observed in these studies. The same dataset was previously used in two other studies [32,55] to make recommendations regarding appropriate crops based on various NPK and climatic variables. However, these studies [32,55] did not perform separate modeling of agricultural and horticultural crops. Additionally, they did not evaluate the comparative performance of ML algorithms through the use of confusion matrices, area under the curve (AUC), and ROC performance. All of these gaps have been addressed in the current study. In our comparative performance study of five different ML models, XGBoost demonstrated higher accuracy compared to the others. Specifically, for agricultural crops, XGBoost achieved an accuracy of 99.09 % and a macro average AUC of 1.0, as shown in Fig. 6. Similarly, for the horticulture trained model, XGBoost achieved an accuracy of 99.3 % and macro average AUC of 1.0, as depicted in fig. 06. In contrast to the 95.62 % accuracy reported by Thilakarathne [55], our study achieved a higher accuracy rate of 98.51 % for the XGBoost model (Table 1). Furthermore, our mixed model achieved a classification confidence of 99 %.
