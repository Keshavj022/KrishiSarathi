Avoid early sowing after first rains during June and late sowing after 1st week of August. yy Form conservation furrows at 3.6 m interval to conserve soil moisture yy Seed treatment with imidacloprid 600 FS @ 1ml/kg followed by tebuconazole 2 DS @ 1g or mancozeb @ 3 g/kg or Trichoderma viride @ 10g/kg to control sucking pests collar rot, PSND in the early stages. yy Sow 4-6 rows of bajra/jowar as border crop to manage vectors (thrips) of PSND/PBND diseases. yy Adopt intercropping with redgram at 7:1/11:1/15:1 ratio. Adopt line sowing with ferti cum seed drill yy Use PSB, KSB, VAM etc. and reduce chemical fertilizer applications. yy Dig farm ponds to conserve rainwater and utilize for life saving irrigation through micro irrigation systems like drip and sprinklers. 189 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS Spray 19:19:19 @1 kg/ac or DAP @ 2 kg/ac during dry spell to mitigate drought. yy Follow IPM practices from early stage of the crop to reduce the pest and disease incidence and crop loss.

If rain is received after 15 September, intercrop with fodder sorghum, fodder pearl millet and horse gram. yy Treat seeds with carbendazim 50 WP @ 1.5 g followed by T. viride @ 8-10 g / kg to control wilt Sesame yy Sowing sesame with the available soil moisture up to June 30th. Select high yielding varieties like Hima, Sarada (YLM 66) and YLM-17. If available provide one life-saving irrigation at 30 DAS. Greengram and Blackgram yy Cultivate YMV resistant, greengram varieties LGG-460, LGG-450, IPM-2-14, WGG 42 and blackgram varieties TBG-104, PU-31, GBG-1, IPU-2-43, LBG-752 and LBG-787. yy Sow from 15th June to 15th July.
