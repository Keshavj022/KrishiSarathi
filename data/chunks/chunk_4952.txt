The organic carbon was in the medium range in the top 45 cm depth, but low in 45_60 cm depth. The nutrient status was medium for available N, high for Olsen's P, and medium (0_15 cm depth) to low (15_60 cm depth) for available K. It requires applications of recommended doses of N and K; the dose of P may be reduced by 25% of the recommended one. The soils are gravelly and of medium texture. The bulk density values indicated progressive increase in soil strength with depth, especially below 30 cm. The average particle density of soil was 2.61 mg/m3. The porosity of soil was thus high, especially in the top 30 cm soil layer. Consequently, the soil was highly permeable to water, and hence well drained. The infiltration rate of soil (after 6 hours of initiation of infiltration process) varied between 5,379 and 7,005 mm/d. The water- retention capacity of the soil is poor due to excess sand content. Terracing Terracing was done in two blocks of the experimental area, covering 20 plant rows, with a total length of 2,040 m. The average width of these terraces was 1.5 m. It involved an earth-work of about 1,530 m3. A gentle side-wise slope was given on each terrace to direct the run-off during rain storms, if any, towards the tree basins (Figs 1 and 2). Fig. 1. A view of terraced block Trenching Trenches (0.3_0.4 m deep and 0.3_0.4 m wide) were made along the hill-side wall, above the apple-tree basins. The total length of trenching, Fig. 2. Side-wise sloping terraces  RAIN WATER MANAGEMENT covering 11 plant rows, was 1,122 m. The average breadth and depth of these trenches was 0.304 m each. Trenching involved an earth-work of 103.6m3. Mulching The tree basins were mulched with FYM (10_15 cm thick layer), pine needles, cocopit (prepared from coconut fibre) and pebbles (single layer) (Figs 3_8). The cocopit was either mixed with soil or spread over soil surface in the tree basin. Five trees with each type of mulch, including the control of no-mulch, were tagged for taking observations on the effect of water harvesting/conservation on the growth and vigour of apple trees. Soil moisture conservation A 6.2 mm rain was received on 31 December 2002.
