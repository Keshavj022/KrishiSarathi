 Future research efforts in soybean are: evolving soybean-based cropping systems; development of varieties minus the anti-nutritional factors and beany flavour constituents in order to widen its consumption as high-quality protein food; to groom the indigenous soya industry; to diversify and add to the present-day forex earning of Rs 14,735 million from soybean meal alone. os; Soybean intercropped with chickpea Soybean intercropped with wheat. The cropping system is preferred by the farmers We are Pientiful in Oilseeds inside 10 years “an ideal mix of research policy and research” The Technology Mission on Oilseeds framed time-bound programmes with objectives in 1986 to help the nation become plentiful in less than 10 years. The approach has been holistic. MICROMISSIONI : Research and technology development in oilseed crops becomes the responsibility of the Indian Council of - Agricultural Research (ICAR) A few good lines of safflower are in testing, such as this one MICROMISSION II: Processing technology for industrial uses of oilseeds is entrusted to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) MICROMISSION Il: Transfer-of-technology and extending oilseeds cultivation to non-traditional areas is left to the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India MICROMISSION IV_; Market intervention for fair price spread is the mandate of the Ministry of Commerce, Government of India.

The TMO has introduced new crops soybean and sunflower, and has extended the cultivation of the oilseed crops to non-traditional areas. During the last 10 years, 176 improved varieties and hybrids have been developed that have paved the way for meeting the nation’s oilseeds requirement. The noteworthy varieties are: groundnut TMV 2, JL 24; rapeseed-mustard PGSH 17; soybean JS 80-21, NRC 2 and sunflower KBSH 1, MSFH 8, MSFH 10, MSFH 17 and MSFH 67. IN FUTURE... The genetic base in groundnut is narrow. In twenty years, the yield has not altered very much in the new varieties. The same holds true for other traditional oilseed crops. Research, therefore would be intensive on the traditional and newly introduced crops that have the potential.
