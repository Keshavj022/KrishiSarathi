 Litchi Rose Scented produced higher yield comparing to other cultivars at GBPUAT, Pantnagar. Maximum yield per plot was obtained in double- hedged-row system at BAC, Sabour and GBPUAT, Pantnagar. Terminal pruning of 7.5 cm branches during harvesting has been recommended for commercial adoption at BCKV, Mohanpur. The litchi fruit-borer was effectively controlled by 2 sprays of Endosulphan (0.07%) or Carbaryl (0.1%). JACKFRUIT Five different types were collected and characterized at Mohanpur. At Kannara, 122 trees were characterized and evaluated. Three varieties have been planted besides selecting 11 clones for further planting at Kovvur. WALNUT The CITH, Srinagar (J&K) has selected a walnut tree BP 4 having its nut and kernel weight of 19.84 and 10.40 g, respectively. It has kernel recovery of 52.42% which is better than the America’s best variety Sunland. It has smooth shell texture with intermediate shell seal and ideal for export purpose. It is expected to reduce its gestation period to about 5 years from about 15 years through vegetative propagation. This will help to raise orchards by its large-scale propagation and country can earn more foreign exchange from its export to 12 countries in the world. NRC FOR LITCHI At NRC for Litchi, Muzaffarpur, 42 acces- sions were collected from different regions for the gene bank. These are being main- tained in the nursery for evaluation. Walnut BP 4 is better than hitherto a popular variety Sunland IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF HORTICULTURAL CROPS 55 ARID ZONE FRUITS The CIAH, Bikaner, maintained 318 accessions of ber,22 of boradii, 150 of pomegranate, 22 of aonla, 105 of cactus pear, 47 of date palm, 32 each of ker and gonda, 558 of kachari, 192 of mateera, 90 of snapmelon, 132 of chilli and 64 of muskmelon. Ber Seb Banarsi Kadaka, Mundia, Dandan, Alwar Desi, Govindgarh Special and Kala Gola were found superior in all aspects. Patch budding success (90.61%) in aonla can be achieved by using perforated polybags of 40 cm × 15 cm size. At Bangalore, planting of pomegranate Ganesh at 5 m × 5 m spacing and application of 500 g : 250 g : 25 g N, P and K/plant/year respectively resulted in maximum fruit size (250 g) and yield of 5.37 tonnes/ha. Micropropagation of hybrid Ruby has been standardized using shoot tips and nodal explants. Cultivars Ganesh, G 137 and Bassein Seedless were found superior in respect of soft seed, high TSS and pink aril colour. It was found that 625 : 250 : 250 g NPK/plant/year was sufficient for the above 4 years plants under Rahuri conditions. Jalore seedless produced highest yield (16.75 kg/plant), big fruit size and high TSS at Jobner. The fruit cracking can be minimized significantly by spraying of borax (0.2%). Germplasm collection of 164 custard-apple accessions were made from different regions of Andhra Pradesh. At Faizabad, 2 promising aonla genotypes NA 23 and 24, one ber that bear fruits twice a year and one jamun were identified.
