 The post-hoc test results for irrigation intensity confirmed that cluster 1 was significantly different from cluster 2 (P=0.001) and cluster 2 was significantly different from cluster 3 (P=0.000) during 2004–2005 (Table S2). The η² S. DAS, et al.: Spatio-temporal variation and relationship between agricultural... Regional Sustainability (2024) 5(2) 100144 11 was determined to be 0.565, indicating that 56.50% of the variation was associated with irrigation intensity. The results of post-hoc test on agricultural efficiency revealed that cluster 1 was significantly different from both clusters 2 and 3 (P-values of 0.007 and 0.000, respectively) during 2018–2019 (Table S3). Similarly, cluster 2 was significantly different from cluster 3 (P=0.000), which was below the P=0.010 level. The η² was determined to be 0.735, indicating that 73.50% of variance was associated with agricultural efficiency during 2018–2019. The assessment of homogeneity of variances through the Levene’s test did not present significant results at the P=0.050 level for agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity, with P-values of 0.737 and 0.696, respectively, during 2018–2019 (Table S4). The one-way ANOVA results during 2018–2019, as outlined in Table 5, supported the rejection of the null hypothesis, indicating unequal means across the three clusters for both agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity. The significant differences between cluster means were apparent, with P-value of 0.000, which was well below the P=0.050 level (Table 5). The findings of the robust test (Welch’s test and Brown-Forsythe test) assessing the equality of means were detailed in Table S5, which affirmed the significance of the adjusted F-statistics in all instances (P>0.005), prompting the rejection of the null hypothesis. The findings from Welch’s test and Brown-Forsythe test robustly supported a significant mean difference between the clusters of agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity.
