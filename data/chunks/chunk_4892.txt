 These technologies empower researchers to develop models based on the collected data, which can be applied to actual production processes. By monitoring the growth status of horticultural crops, these models can guide optimal management decisions, ensuring the growth process is effectively optimized. However, the rapid advancement of imaging sensors has resulted in an overwhelming volume of digital horticultural data, leading the horticultural science community to contend with a flood of irrelevant and redundant information. Consequently, it is crucial to develop suitable analytical technologies to extract valuable features from this unrefined data while addressing the practical challenges of translating these technologies into real-world applications. This review aims to explore the applications of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, deep learning, big data analytics, and decision trees in the context of significant horticultural crops. Additionally, it highlights recent AI tools and techniques designed to manage large data sets, encouraging their application to solve pressing problems and facilitating the transition towards a smart horticulture industry. Novemberâ€“December 2024 55 Applications of AI Recognition and classification The use of AI tools for flower recognition and classification is crucial for enhancing biodiversity conservation efforts, aiding agricultural practices by identifying plant varieties, facilitating ecological research, and supporting horticultural industries by optimizing breeding and cultivation processes. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been employed to classify flower images using a database of 9,500 images, achieving a recognition rate of 97.78% across five batches of training and testing data, outperforming other classifier models on the same dataset. Additionally, a pre-trained CNN model has demonstrated high accuracy rates of 96.39 and 95.70% for flower species classification on two distinct datasets, Flower17 and Flower102, respectively. A novel classification method utilizing a binary classifier within a fully convolutional network framework has been developed to differentiate between various flower types, even among species with similar shapes and appearances. Moreover, a deep-learning approach for vegetable image classification was created using the AlexNet network model implemented in Caffe, resulting in a significant improvement in classification accuracy, reaching 92.1% on the test dataset compared to traditional back propagation neural networks. Deep learning models utilizing VGG16 and ResNet50 networks have also been employed to recognize large-flowered chrysanthemums, achieving remarkable recognition performance and speed. Overall, accurate identification of flower species can help prevent the spread of invasive species and improve landscape management, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability.
