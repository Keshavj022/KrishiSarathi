 In the cropping systems, sometimes a number of crops are grown together or they are grown separately at short intervals in the same field. It has been found that more than 250 double cropping systems are followed throughout the country. Based on rationale of relative spread of crops in each district in the country, 30 important cropping systems have been identified. These are rice-wheat (10.50 mha), rice-rice (5.58 mha), rice- chickpea (0.59 mha), rice-mustard, rice-groundnut, rice-sorghum, pearl millet-chickpea, pearl millet- mustard (0.94 mha), pearl millet- sorghum (1.35 mha), cotton-wheat (1.39 mha), rice-vegetables (1.24 mha), rice-fallow (4.42 mha) cotton- chickpea, cotton-sorghum, cotton- safflower, cotton-groundnut, maize-wheat (1.29 mha), maize- chickpea (0.54 mha), sugarcane- wheat (0.97 mha), soybean-wheat (2.23 mha), sorghum-sorghum (0.74 mha), groundnut-wheat, sorghum- groundnut, pearl millet-wheat (1.35 mha), rice-groundnut (1.02 mha), sorghum-wheat, sorghum- gram, pigeon pea-sorghum, groundnut-groundnut, sorghum- rice, groundnut-rice, groundnut- sorghum and soybean-chickpea. But in recent years, new cropping systems have been identified in different agro-climatic zones of the country based on the productivity and profitability. Selection of cropping systems Widespread occurrence of circumstances, such as over- mining of soil nutrients, decline in factor productivity, reduction in profitability, lowering of groundwater tables and building up of pests including weeds, diseases and insects has been reported during post-green revolution. Most of the intensively cultivate, high-productivity, cereal based Kufri Mohan potato variety suitable for western plain of Uttar Pradesh Pulse crops (blackgram and chickpea) for alternative cropping systems Vegetable crops (pea and french bean) for alternative cropping systems Oilseed (groundnut) and cereal (rice) crops for alternative cropping systems Indian Farming 38 July 2023 production systems, which are threatening their studies carried out under AICRP on cropping systems have resulted in identification of appropriate duration of varieties for popular crop sequences for different regions of the country. For considering the specific needs of different regions, concerted efforts have been made to design new alternative cropping systems (Table 1). Resources for cropping systems in India Estimates indicate that more than 56% of total food grain comes from irrigated ecosystem while progress has been considerably sluggish in rain fed agriculture which still accounts for 92.8 mha or 65% of net sown area and contributes only 44% to national food grain production.
