 Mealybugs India has 10 economically important mealybug species. The papaya mealybug, from Central America, was introduced to India in 2007. All species belong to Hemiptera and Pseudococcidae. All these organisms are polyphagous, meaning they can eat many plant genera. Furthermore, each species has distinct features. A few mealybug species are vectors for viruses. Mealybugs that transmit viral diseases pose a greater threat than non-transmitting mealybugs. For instance, the citrus mealybug is a vector of the Banana Streak Virus (BSV). The Mealybug Wilt of Pineapple (Pineapple mealybug wilt-associated viruses 1 and 2) is a virus disease associated with Pineapple mealybug. Three species of pineapple mealybug have already been identified as vectors of the disease. The initial focus of infection usually occurs near the field edges and spreads inward. The pineapple mealybug is associated with the roots of its host plant. Additionally, it can be observed that the organism conceals itself among the pineapple plant’s inner bracts and leaf whorls, thereby evading insecticidal sprays that cannot penetrate these specific areas. The primary site of infection typically manifests near the field’s boundaries and subsequently expands towards the centre. Both banana and pineapple are important economic fruits of the NE Region. Mealybugs are 3-4 mm long, cotton-like, spongy arthropods. They appear on leaves, stems, and roots. The insects live in colonies with white mealy matter or wax covering that protects them from insecticides. These organisms form tight, white cotton-like clusters in heavy infestations, making removal more challenging. These organisms use their piercing and sucking mouthparts to suck sap from foliage and stems, depriving the plant of nourishment. In severe infestations, sooty mould darkens the plant. Ants care for mealybugs for their honeydew secretion and help them move across plants. Mealybugs were once considered minor pests. However, these little insects have become major pests in Spiralling Whitefly on King Chilli Mealybugs on different host plants November–December 2023 107 many crops, requiring control measures. Shifting climatic conditions may be contributing to mealybug proliferation and damage. The government is promoting organic production in the NE region, where pineapple is a major commercial commodity with an export market and value enhancement. It’s important to note that the pineapple mealybug might threaten its development and destroy orchards. Hortimin and Lastraw are non-insecticidal mixtures that manage all soft-bodied sucking pests such as mealybugs, thrips, white flies, mites, aphids, scale insects, and plant hoppers. Some organic salt-based mixtures are sold. These are eco-friendly, naturally safe, non-toxic, and biodegradable treatments for persistent insect pests with a mealy/waxy covering that outperforms synthetic chemical insecticides.
