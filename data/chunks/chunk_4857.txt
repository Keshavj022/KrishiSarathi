 Smart farming (SF), which harnesses AI alongside mechanization, sensors, and various information and communication technologies (ICT), is poised to lead a new Green Revolution in the food sector. Smart farming Smart farming (SF) is the precision farming done with the help of modern information and communication technologies (ICT). It is based on the incorporation of ICT into machinery, equipment, and sensors in agricultural production systems. Data plays a very important role in modern agriculture. A large volume of data needs to be collected from the field as well as from other sources. Data on weather, soil, pest and diseases, marketing, production, processing, livestock, fisheries etc. are to be collected for taking timely and proper decisions. The nature and volume of data varies with the sector and context. Collection and analysis of this data with the help of ICT technologies is the basis of SF. Sustainable use of natural resources for increasing production and at the same time protecting the environment are the major objectives of SF. Use of smart devices and sensors for data collection is one of the major factors of its success. The data collected is processed immediately. After processing, the system takes a decision on what action to be performed. If the action decided is to switch on the fertigation device, the message to switch it on may be sent to the mobile of the farmer or the device can be automatically switched on. The whole process from data collection to action happens automatically. This way resource utilization becomes more efficient and production increases. Components of smart farming are IoT devices, Software for mapping and data analysis, Sensors, Internet and Machinery. Devices under the category Internet of Things (IoT) is the most important component as far as SF is concerned. Many of the SF devices include at least one or the other of the other four components of SF. Components of IoT devices are connected through the internet. The sensors collect data and through the internet, it goes for processing. After processing the data, the device takes the decision about the action to be performed. The decision may be to do fertigation, spray pesticide using The agricultural sector is facing the critical challenge of increasing food production by 60% over the next 25 years to feed a growing global population. Smart farming (SF), leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), offer promising solutions to these challenges. SF integrates technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, sensors, and automated systems for precision farming, enabling efficient resource utilization and increased productivity. Key components of SF include data collection, real-time monitoring, and automated decision-making processes that optimize inputs like water and fertilizers, ultimately enhancing crop yields while conserving natural resources.
