Frontline demonstrations Cluster frontline demonstration The Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi initiated national level Cluster Frontline Demonstration (CFLDs) on Pulses and Oilseeds with funding support from Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmersâ€™ Welfare with main objective to demonstrate the production potential of new varieties and the related technologies. The project also aimed for enhancing the pulses and oilseeds production in the country. Pulses: Out of a total of 23,245.00 ha area planned, 22,329.53 ha area was covered by conducting 60,166 demonstrations across the country. A total of 8,175.59 ha area (22,421 demonstrations) was covered in kharif, 10,834.04 ha area (29,440 demonstrations) in rabi and 3,319.90 ha (8,305 demonstrations) in summer season. There was 263.23, 175.51 and 33.95% increase in yield over national average yield, state average yield and local check yield, respectively, in blackgram; 78.04, 26.23 and 38.64% in green gram; 62.62, 111.78 and 34.68% in pigeon pea; 131.84, 126.93 and 29.51% in chickpea; 71.41, 184.20 and 34.69% in fieldpea; 59.20, 118.68 and 34.05% in lentil; and 4.35, 77.90 and ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 143 TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, DEMONSTRATION AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 144 37.72% in summer green gram under CFLDs on pulses.
