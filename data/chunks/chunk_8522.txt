 IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF HORTICULTURAL CROPS 57 27 at Kovvur and 14 at Periyakulam were maintained and evaluated. The variety PKM 1 was found superior in terms of growth and yield. Among 31 hybrids evaluated at Periyakulam, hybrid progenies of Guthi × Badami was found promising. Planting density of 312 plants/ha (8 m × 4 m spacing) recorded higher yield for PKM 1. Application of 600 g N, 200 g K2O/plant/year in PKM 1 under Periyakulam conditions was found ideal. It was also observed that at Gandevi, application of 25 kg FYM, 400 g N, 60 g P2O5 and 300 g K2O/plant/year recorded higher yield of Kalipatti sapota. Application of 150 : 40 : 150 g N : P2O5 : K2O5/plant/year with 25 kg FYM or 200 : 40 : 150 g N : P2O5 : K2O/plant/year with 5 kg vermicompost recoded higher yields of Kalipatti under Arabhavi conditions. LITCHI Forty-two accessions of litchi collected from Bihar, West Bengala and Jharkhand are maintained in the field gene bank at NRC for Litchi, Muzaffarpur. Under AICRP on Subtropical Fruits a total of 48 germplasm accessions and 13 superior seedlings were maintained at different centres, viz. 13 each germplasm accessions and superior seedlings at BCKV, Mohanpur; 21 at GBPUA&T, Pantnagar and 15 at RAU, Pusa including hybrid Sabour Madhu (Purbi × Bedana). In evaluation of germplasm at BCKV, Mohanpur, maximum fruit weight in selection SG-JAL-6, minimum seed weight in SG-JAL-10 and maximum TSS and minimum acidity in selection SG- JAL-2 were recorded. Similarly, Rose Scented recorded maximum fruit weight at Pantnagar. JACKFRUIT At Mohanpur, 8 superior genotypes of jackfruit have been identified while at Kannara 156 trees were characterized for growth and yield as per the IPGRI descriptors. Wide variation was observed for all the characters. Among them, 5 each were identified for table and culinary purposes and 2 for chips making. Softwood grafting tried at Kannara revealed that rootstocks of 6 months old were ideal for good graft success. Survey studies for the incidence of pests and diseases indicated that there was an incidence of leaf-eating caterpillar, spittlebug, leaf folder, bark-eating caterpillar and grey weevil in jackfruit-growing regions. Major diseases of jackfruit were Rhizopus fruit rot and leaf spot. TEMPERATE FRUITS In walnut, selections AAS/AHP/BP/DS-2 and LG 5 having smooth shell texture, light shell colour and nut weight 20.45 and 27.16 g respectively; selections AAS/ AHP/BP-GG-7 and BBW-8 having 57.25 and 58.38% kernel recovery and kernel weight of 6.87 and 8.63 g respectively were identified for cultivation. The latter selections have extra light kernels and potential to fetch better foreign exchange in the international market with better returns to the growers. In vegetative propagation, 63% success has been achieved by bench grafting under ordinary double-walled polyhouse. Pre-soaking and use of GA3 + thiourea in walnut increased germination rate from 55 to 83.3%.
