 Control of scale insect: Dip the three budded setts in malathion (2 ml/l) or dimethoate (2 ml/l) for 15 minutes before planting. Detrash the cane in the first week of July, August and September months followed by spraying with dimethoate 1.7 ml/l or malathion 3 ml/ lt. Smut management: Avoid second ratoon if incidence is severe. Treat three budded setts in hot water at 52o C for two hours followed by dipping setts in carbendazim. Select seed material from disease free areas atleast 40m away from affected fields. Treat the setts with azoxystrobin + tebuconazole (1ml/l) or propiconazole (1 ml/ lt) or hexaconazole (2ml/L) for 15 minutes before planting. Spray propiconazole (1.0 ml/L) immediately after ratooning and 30 days after 1st spray in ratoon crop. Management of red rot: Select healthy seed material from disease free areas. Avoid ratooning of infected plant crop. Keep the crop erect without lodging by trash twist propping. Soil application of Trichoderma asperellum @ 5 kg along with 200 kg FYM to reduce the soil inoculums of red rot as well as soil borne pathogens. Sesame Varieties recommended: Gouri, Madhavi, Varaha, Gowtham and Sarada Sowing time: Rabi / Summer: Dec. 15 – January 31 Seed rate: 2.4 kg / acre Seed treatment: Treat the seed with thiram /Captan/mancozeb @ 3 g/ kg seed against soil borne diseases. Against sucking pests, use ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 360 Imidachloprid @ 5 ml or thiamethoxam @ 5 g per kg seed. Sowing: Line sowing with a spacing of 30 cm between the rows and 15 cm between the plants is preferable. Manures and Fertilizers: Farmyard manure 4 t, 16 kg nitrogen, 8 kg phosphorus and 8 kg potash need to be applied per acre. Farmyard manure, entire phosphorus & potash and ½ of the nitrogen need to be applied as basal. The remaining ½ nitrogen is to be applied at flowering stage (30-35 DAS) followed by irrigation as top dressing. Thinning: Thinning is to be done 15 days after sowing leaving single plant per hill Weeding & Inter cultivation: Pendimethalin @ 4-5 ml/ l is to be applied within 48 hrs after sowing. Intercultivation with gorru is to be practiced at 20-25 DAS. Management of Leaf webber cum capsule borer: Spray chlorpyriphos @ 2.5 ml or Monocrotophos @ 1.6 ml per litre of water. Management of root rot: Remove the effected plants and destroy. Drench the soil with copper oxychloride @ 3 ml per litre of water at the base of the plants. Management of Powdery Mildew: Occurs mostly in rabi / summer season. Spray wettable sulphur @ 3g / litre of water. Horticultural Crops Mango Application of Paclobutrazol @ 10 g a.i. for non-bearing trees during first fortnight of September will induce flowering and fruit set yield during off years. Spray NAA @ 20 ppm during November December and February for better flowering, fruit setting, fruit retention. During February 0.5% Urea (5 g/l) or 1% Potassium Nitrate (10g/l) may be sprayed to induce flowering if trees do not flower by that time.
