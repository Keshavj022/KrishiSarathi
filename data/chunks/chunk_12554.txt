 Soybean productivity is high in Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Pune districts and there is great scope to increase area under this crop. While, Amravati, Nagpur, Washim and Yavatrnal and districts have large area but low in productivity hence adoption of proper package of practices for soybean is necessary in these districts. Productivity levels of sugarcane are highly variable among the major cane growing districts; the low productivity levels in Beed, Jalana, Osmanabad and Parbhani districts require a special attention Cotton, another commercial crop shows wide scope for yield improvement i n Ahmednagar, Nanded, Buldhana and Yavatrnal and to some extent in Jalgaon, Aurangabad and Jalana districts Table: Criteria adopted for categorization of productivity zones of major field crops Crop Area (“00”ha) Yield (Kg/ha) High Medium Low High Medium Low Paddy >1400 700-1400 <700 >2000 1000-2000 <1000 Kharif >1000 500-1000 <500 >1500 1000-1500 <1000 Pearl millet >1500 600-1500 <600 >750 500-750 <500 Ground nut >400 400-100 <100 >1000 750-1000 <750 Soybean >2000 1000- <1000 >2000 1000-2000 <1000 Red gram >600 300-600 <300 >1000 500-1000 <500 Black gram >300 150-300 <150 >750 500-750 <500 Green gram >300 150-300 <150 >750 500-750 <500 Cotton >2250 800-2250 <800 >500 250-500 <250 Wheat >550 350-550 <350 >2250 1250-2250 <1250 Rabi >2800 1400- <1400 >1200 600-1200 <600 Safflower >250 100-250 <100 >800 500-800 <500 333 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Crop Area (“00”ha) Yield (Kg/ha) High Medium Low High Medium Low Sugarcane >900 300-900 <300 >75000 50000-75000 <50000 Constraints in rice cultivation i. Inadequate irrigation ii. Uncertainity in monsoon i.e early and late start iii. Irratic rains iv. Less no. of rainy days compare to normal viz., booting, flowering and grain filling stage in September- October v. Dry spell during critical crop growth stages vi. Change in climatic condition- Drought, Heavy rains, flood, cloudy weather for longer time, sudden increase/decrease in temperature. vii. Low organic carbon, deficiency of Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Zinc and Sulphur in soil viii. Insects – Gall midge, Stem borer, Brown plant hoppers, White backed plant hoppers, Green leaf hoppers, Leaf Folder, Case Worm, Army Worm, Gundhi Bug, Sheath mite. ix. Diseases – Blast, Bacterial leaf blight, Sheath Blight, Sheath Rot, Stem rot, Brown spot, False smut Constraints for Soybean i. Almost rainfed crop, therefore influenced by vagaries of monsoon. ii. Lack of diversification in varieties cultivated. iii. Lack of technical knows how. iv. Lack of adoption of improved technology v. Lack of timely availability of appropriate quantity and quality of agriculture input. vi. Lack of varieties resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses. Constraints for Safflower The National and International scenario indicates an yield gap of >21% over World Average and >100% yield gap over highest yield of 1564 kg/ha in USA.
