Management practices yy Avoid successive planting of onion in the same field and follow crop rotation. yy Use well decomposed cow manure. yy Field sanitization, removal of weeds, destruction of damaged onions to reduce population build up. yy Soils that are rich in un-decomposed matter should be avoided. yy Close planting of onions should be avoided to reduce movement of maggots in the nearby areas. yy Drenching of the chlorpyrifos with irrigation at 1.6-2 litre/ acre should be done before transplanting or when infestation starts to appear. This will effectively control maggot infestation up to 8 weeks. yy After hand weeding, fipronil 80% WG should be applied in the soil at 1 kg/ acre followed by irrigation.

Summer squash is bushy in nature; hence, it does not require any trailing and pruning but earthing up is essential to cover the roots properly. The raised beds should be covered through black plastic as mulch. Otherwise one or two hand-weeding are required. It requires 2-3 hoeing and weeding. Frequent irrigation at shorter interval is required. The older leaves should be removed at regular interval to prevent the plant from various diseases and pests and to provide the plant proper aeration and light.
