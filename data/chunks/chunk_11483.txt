 Chemical management: i) To control FAW larvae at 5% damage to reduce hatching ability of freshly laid eggs, spray 5% NSKE nor Azadirachtin 1500 ppm@5ml/litre of water; ii) To manage 2nd and 3rd instars larvae @ 10-20% damage, spray Spinetoram 11.7&SC @0.5ml/litre of water; iii) After emergence of tasselling, hand picking of the larvae is advisable as insecticide management at this stage Is not cost effective. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 279 Pulses Cultivation of Rajmash could be started by second fortnight of August and completed in first fortnight of September using improved varieties like ARUN using basal dose of NPK @ 20:40:20 at the time of sowing. Seed bio fortification with Rhizobium and PSB culture should be done before sowing for better plant stand and yield. Apply pre-emergence herbicide Pendimethalin @ 1.5 /ha or Butachlor @ 10ml/litre of water for weed control. Oilseeds Soybean Sowing of Soyabean could be completed from 1st week of September using high yielding variety like JS 335, VL 89 and others. Pre emergence weedicide Butachlor may be used to control upland weeds @ of 10 ml/ litre of water. For higher crop production NPK @ of 20:60:40 may be applied for better yield. Seed bio fortification with Rhizobium and PSB culture should be done before sowing for better plant stand and yield. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 280 To control Blister beetle that feed on Soyabean flower Dichlorvos @ 2 ml per litre of water may be used. Toria Cultivation of Toria could be completed from second fortnight of September using high yielding variety like TS 67, TS 36 and Ts 38. Spacing 30 cm row to row and 5 – 10cm plant to plant. Thinning is done 3 weeks after sowing in order to maintain the 5-10 cm plant to plant distance. Seed rate: 5 – 6 kg/ha. Spraying of Isoproturan @ 0.75 kg a.i and Pendimethalin @ 1kg a.i/ ha controlled the rabi weeds effectively and produced higher yield. For higher crop production NPK @ of 50:60:30 may be applied for better yield. Seed should be treated through Thirum/ Captan 2.5 gm/kg seed. Spraying of Blitox -50 or Dithane M 45@ 2g/l of water at 10 days interval found to be effective in controlling Rust and Alternaria blight. Nursery Management of Winter Vegetable Crops Select a sunny area with well drained friable light soil rich in organic matter. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 281 Nursery bed should be prepared by second week of August. Bring the soil into fine tilth and raise the bed to 10-15 cm above ground level. Mix well rotten farmyard manure/ compost or leaf compost in the soil. To make the soil free from soil-borne disease-causing pathogens (Damping-off), drench the bed with 0.1% solution of Captan or Fytolan. Cover immediately with polythene sheet or gunny bag or thick paper for 2 days. Uncover the soil and get it loosened and leave it as such for 3-4 days. Mix Malathion 5% dust thoroughly to protect the seedlings from soil-borne insects.
