 was given to the subject. Data on heart rate were taken with the help of polar heart rate monitor during each trial. Data on strokes/min., force applied, quantity of groundnuts/batch, brokens, unshelled/partially-shelled pods, damaged, foreign matter were noted. During decortication, the kernel output with sitting and standing type decorticators were 26 and 33 kg/hr as against 1.1 kg/hr by traditional method. The mean working heart rates were 85.5, 111.0 and 121.8 beats/min. for traditional method, sitting type decorticator and standing type decorticator, respectively. The mean values of force required to operate the handle at the start of the batch was 4.8 kgf for standing type groundnut decorticators. Similar study was also conducted with hand-operated maize shellers, viz. rotary disc type maize sheller and tubular maize sheller and compared with local method of maize shelling. Each trial was of 1 hr duration. For rotary disc type maize sheller, trial duration was of 30 min. The results indicated that the working heart rate for rotary disc type sheller, tubular sheller and traditional method (with sickle) were 114, 93 and 88 beats/min. and increase in heart rate over rest were 36.3, 15.7 and 11.6 beats/min., respectively. The rotary disc type maize sheller had the maximum output of 73 kg/hr, followed by tubular maize sheller (27 kg/hr) and traditional Tractor-mounted fodder harvester in a single operation can harvest, chop and load the chopped fodders like maize, pearlmillet, oat etc. in the trailer attached to the machine ● A walk-behind-type self-propelled forage harvester developed at PAU, Ludhiana Centre of AICRP on FIM ● A flail type mower-cum-chopper developed and commercialized at PAU, Ludhiana Centre of AICRP on FIM for fodder crop harvesting ● A high capacity pigeonpea thresher having automatic chain conveyor or type feeding mechanism developed at CIAE, Bhopal ● A set-up for measurement of strength parameters of workers developed by the Bhopal Centre of AICRP on Human Engineering and Safety in Agriculture DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 134 Overview of agricultural accidents in Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Tamil Nadu Particulars States Madhya Pradesh Orissa Tamil Nadu Survey varied by CIAE, OUAT, TNAU, Bhopal Bhubaneshwar Coimbatore Number of villages 8 villages from 12 villages from 12 villages surveyed 8 districts 12 districts from 9 districts Total number of accidents 76 131 373 reported during 1995-99 Fatal 7 (9.2%) 27 (21%) 16 (4.3%) Non-fatal 69 (90.8%) 104 (79%) 357 (95.7%) Overall accident incidence 1.25 1.77 2.81 rate/1000 workers/year Category-wise accidents Farm machinery 60 (79.0%) 52 (39.7%) 334 (89.5%) Hand tools 9 (11.8%) 28 (21.0%) 36 (9.7%) Others (snake bites, 7 (9.2%) 51 (39.3%) 5 (1.3%) animal bites, fall in wells, lightning, heat stroke etc.) Category-wise accident incidence rates Farm machinery 2.95 2.85 18.66 (1,000 machines/year) Hand tools 0.08 0.39 0.20 (1,000 hand tools/ year) Others 0.13 0.88 0.
