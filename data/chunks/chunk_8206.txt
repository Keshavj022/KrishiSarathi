 To revive depleting fishery in affected stretches, the discharge should be maintained at least in Class D during lean season between 132.48 and 140.84 Cumecs. Soil and Water Health Card ICAR-CIBA developed soil and water health card for aquaculture farmers. The card provides data of essential soil and water parameters required for fish farming. Regular updating of the card will help to record long term trends in soil and water parameters. The card is based on data of 280 soil and water samples from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Gujarat. It also captures the demographic details of farmers, farms, and fish culture details on the front page and optimum values of essential soil and water parameters on the back page. e-Atlas for water bodies of Gujarat e-Atlas for water bodies of Gujarat: Electronic Atlas (e-Atlas) of water bodies of more than 0.5 ha was developed based on IRS imageries for Gujarat. The water bodies can be visualized along with roads, important places, rail networks, etc. The delineated water bodies can also be viewed by compatible GIS SOIL AND WATER PRODUCTIVITY DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 18 software like TNT Mips, ArcGIS, and other open source GIS software’s. Biomarkers for aquatic pollution: Heat shock protein (hsp) transcript profiles are potential biomarkers of aquatic pollution. Gene expression analysis of a battery of heat shock proteins (hsp27, hsp47, hsp60, hsp70, and hsp90) and their regulatory molecules (hsf1) in gill and liver tissues of Rita rita collected from different stretches of river Ganga revealed up-regulation of hsp47, hsp70, hsc70 genes and down-regulation of hsp27 gene. Up-regulation is correlated with decreasing dissolved oxygen content. This could be mediated by organic pollutants and heavy metal pollution, suggesting hsp70 and hsp47 could be possible biomarkers of contamination by organic pollutants and heavy metals, and hsp 27 for coliform contamination in aquatic environment. ❑ Climate change impact on rice production in eastern India: Regional analysis of rice yields using DSSAT– (CERES) rice model for eastern region was done with different varieties and in soil series under the A1B climate-change scenario by subsuming 367 grid point spread over 170 districts, representing Bihar (54/37), Chhattisgarh (64/16), Jharkhand (35/17), Odisha (62/30), Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal (112/68 and 40/18). Weather data of baseline (1961–1990), middle (2021–2050) and future (2071–2098) climate-change scenarios of the A1B with four CO2 levels of 380, 420, 550 and 680 ppm were applied to calibrate and validate genotype coefficients of rice cultivars, Sarjoo 52 (Uttar Pradesh), MTU 1010 (Bihar), Mahamaya (Chhattisgarh) and Vandana (Jharkhand). Agro- ecological sub region-wise 13 soil series data derived from INFO-CROP were also used in the analysis. Late- sown rice yields increased in A1B scenario.
