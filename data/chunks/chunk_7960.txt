 Fruits ripen during second week of June. copra outturn of 28.65 kg/palm/year, which is 61.4% higher than copra yield of local control, WCT (17.8 kg/ palm/year). It has tender nut water in large quantity (612 ml) with TSS of 6.12o Brix. Considering high copra outturn and tender nut quality, Kalpa Shatabdi has been recommended for cultivation in coconut-growing tracts of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. A high-yielding arecanut selection, Shatamangala, was developed with dry kernel yield of 3.91 kg/palm/ year and tender nut yield of 3.26 kg/palm/year. It is regular-bearing with good kernel quality and suitable for tender nut processing. It exhibited better yield over Mangala (34.24%), Sumangala (20.73%), Sreemangala (24.53%), and South Kanara Local (47.76%) with high recovery of first quality processed tender nuts (68.4%). This variety is semi-tall and characterized by medium thick stem, shorter internodes, partially drooping crown, regular-bearing with medium maturity. It starts bearing from fourth year with synchronized maturity of nuts, high yield, well placed bunches, round, orange colour fruits, higher content of polysaccharides and polyphenols with high recovery (26.80%) of dry kernel from fresh nut. The variety is suitable for production of dry kernels and processed tender nuts, and is recommended for cultivation in Karnataka, West Bengal and Gujarat. A cocoa hybrid, VTLCH-5 (IC 622884), was released as Nethra Centura. This is precocious, stable and a heavy bearer with medium canopy (16-18 m2) under arecanut and coconut gardens (as both seedlings and clones). This performs well under normal (2.7 m × 5.4 m under arecanut) and high-density planting (2.7 m × 2.7 m under arecanut and 2.5 m × 2.5 m under coconut). With an average of 66 pods/tree/year, 43 beans/pod, single bean dry weight of 1.11 g. It recorded highest dry bean yield of 3.2 kg/tree/year and yield 1,800 kg/ha (600 trees) with 11% shelling percentage, nib recovery of 88 and 52% fat content. Yield of VTLCH-5 was much higher than VTLCH-1 (1.4 kg/tree in hybrid trial) and VTLCC-1 (1-1.3 kg/tree in clonal trial). It is recommended for cultivation in Western Ghats, hills and plains of Kerala and Karnataka, and irrigated arecanut and coconut gardens of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.This variety is highly suitable for chocolate industry. Pomegrante hybrid Solapur Lal In pomegranate, Solapur Lal, a promising hybrid was developed for table purpose. This has early maturity (160-165 days) with high yield of 23-27 tonnes/ha, better TSS (17.5-17.7°B), vitamin C (19.4-19.8 mg/ 100g) and anthocyanin content of 385-395 mg/100g). Besides, it has higher content of zinc (0.64-0.69 mg/ 100g of fresh arils) as compared to Bhagwa (0.5- 0.54mg/100g of fresh arils). The iron content is also significantly higher in Solapur Lal compared to Bhagwa. Solapur Anardana, a promising pomegranate hybrid suitable for processing, has been developed.
