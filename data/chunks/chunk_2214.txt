 The diversity of bee pollinators was low but was relatively higher at Polavaram (Shannon Weiner Fig. 2. Individual rarefaction curve of the three districts ICAR-CGIAR | ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 10 diversity index â€“ 0.91) compared to Bhimavaram (0.54). Richness index of bee pollinators was also higher at Polavaram (0.62) compared to Bhimavaram (0.39). Water quality: Oxidation reduction potential (ORP) an indication of the health of the water in terms of its oxygen content, was low in all the water samples indicating low productivity potential of the water body. Cr, Pb, Cu, Hg and Ar were recorded in all water samples but were within the permissible limit, however, there is threat of their biomagnification and bio-accumulation. Four insecticides (Propuxur, Carbaryl, Phosalone and Ethion) were also detected in the water samples. Land use land cover (LULC) pattern in study area and Modelling Sediment Loss/Retention. The changes in LULC classes data from Bhuvan (Indian Geo-Platform from ISRO) and sediment loss from each of the LULC classes were studied using GIS and models. The study showed that croplands accounted for about 60-70% of the landuse in Karimnagar and West Godavari while in Adilabad it was less than 50%. Deciduous Needle leaf forest accounted for a significant proportion of the landcover in Adilabad (32.75 %) while in Karimnagar it was about 16.22 % and in West Godavari it was 20.79 %. Study of the changes in LULC over the three decades (1985, 1995, 2005) in the three districts showed that the area under cropland increased over the years in Adilabad and Karimnagar while it decreased from 5735.13 km2 in 1985 to 5122.41 km2 in 1995 but improved slightly to 5330.42 km2 in 2005 in West Godavari. Significantly, the water bodies class increased in 1995 and 2005 in this district over that in 1985. In Adilabad and Karimnagar, however, the area under water bodies decreased to almost negligible over the years. Modelling Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR). The Sediment Delivery Ratio module of InVEST model was used to assess the sediment losses from different LULC classes in the three selected landscapes. The input data required as well as the conceptual model is shown in Fig. 3 and included 2004-05 LULC classification at 100 m resolution, elevation raster dataset (ASTER DEM) at 30 m resolution, a normalised raster dataset with an erosivity value for each cell derived using information on sand/ Fig. 3. Input data and conceptual diagram of Sediment Delivery Ratio module ICAR-CGIAR | ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 11 silt/clay/organic carbon. Published procedures were used to derive values of cover management factor (C) and support practice factor (P) in the biophysical table and calibration parameter Borselli K. Other calibration parameters viz., Borselli IC0 and SDRmax were set as default. The model estimated total annual sediment export from the landscapes understudy were 2.23 t/ha/yr in Adilabad landscape while that of Karimanagar and West Godavari it was (0.
