 Seeing the potential, AVPR exports Ltd has also started supplying watermelon to Nepal by road. CONCLUSION Watermelon is an important crop in India which has become more popular during the last two decades earning good returns to farmers. To make the crop more remunerative, a model export value chain of watermelon was successfully established by ICAR-IIHR in collaboration with an exporter to Dubai. After their success, several other export companies are now venturing into marketing watermelon to Dubai and Middle east. Buoyed over the acceptance of Indian watermelons in these markets, exporters are hopeful to increase the trade volumes.

While pesticides effectively controlled targeted insect pests, they inadvertently decimated the natural enemies of phytophagous mites. Consequently, formerly inconspicuous mite species have emerged as significant pests in present times. The shift from minor to major pest status has been observed in various phytophagous mite species, particularly those that subsist on plant material. This article aims to examine the underlying factors responsible for the evolution of phytophagous mites from minor to major pests, elucidating the contributing elements of this process. M ITES, belonging to the phylum Arthropoda, class Arachnida, subclass Acari, and order Acarina, are diminutive organisms that pose significant challenges to cultivated crops, ornamental crops, and wild plants. The initial documented instance of a phytophagous mite in India was reported by Wood-Mason (1884), who documented the presence of Tetranychus bioculatus on tea plants in Assam. In recent times, phytophagous mites have emerged as significant pests, causing severe damage to various crops, ornamental plants, fruit trees, and medicinal plants across different regions of India. Previously, apple orchards in Himachal Pradesh exhibited relatively low incidence of phytophagous mite infestations. However, in the early 1990s, infestations of the European red mite, Panonychus ulmi (Koch), were recorded in apple orchards in Himachal Pradesh, subsequently spreading to nearby areas. The mites fed on the foliage, extracting juices and chlorophyll, resulting in the discolouration of leaves, which appeared pale and acquired a bronze hue. Effective management of mite infestations in orchards was achieved through regular application of sprays and the utilization of natural predators.
