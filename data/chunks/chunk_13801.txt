 In the current study, the contamination factor was calculated by dividing the obtained concentration of ith ele- ment by the concentration of the same element in the control soil sample. 3. Result and discussion The investigation revealed that the nearby agricultural sites of the Sukinda chromite mine were contaminated with high concen- trations (mg kg1) of PTEs especially Cd, TCr, Fe, Ni, Pb, Mn, and Zn in the range of 0.07–1.41, 2143.66–5587.9, 4139.33–12686.9, 1030.5–1638.3, 20.0–70.8, 95.7–240.1, and 94.3–190.8 respec- tively (Table 1). Total Cr- concentration is found to be high across the sites along with other ferronickel metals such as Fe, and Ni. Total Cr was about 30–80 times higher in concentration in compar- ison to the world’s average total Cr concentration, while Ni was higher by about 20–33 times. However, the concentration of Fe was lower in all the sites in comparison to the world’s average con- centration of Fe in soil i.e., 40000 mg kg1 (Table 2). The concentra- tion of Pb was 1.7 times lower in S2 and S4 (28.3 and 20 mg kg1 respectively) than the world’s average concentration of Pb in soil, although other sites (S1, S3, and S5) were 1–2 times higher with world’s average concentration of Pb in soil. Geologically it has Chromiferous ultramaﬁc rocks nestled within the iron-ore sub- group with an estimated age of 2950–3200 Ma [34]. This mine is located at the eastern border of the Indian Precambrian Shield where the chromate ore has been observed to exist in serpentine pockets within the dunite-peridotite rock formations [33]. Chro- mium ore comprises predominantly of Cr2O3 (68%) and FeO (32%) [10]. It is also reported the oxides of Al, Ni, and Mg in the Sukinda chromite mine, which known as nickeliferous chromite ore. Hence, Cr and other associated minerals such as Fe and Ni were found in Fig. 1. The mining region and study sites (Agricultural plots) are depicted along with major geological formations in the region. A. Naz Materials Today: Proceedings xxx (xxxx) xxx 3 higher concentrations. However high concentrations of these ele- ments in the nearby agricultural soil were indicating seepage of these elements from the mine to nearby areas, which is alarming. Table 2 indicates the positive correlation between total Cr with Pb, Cd, and Zn, Ni with Zn and Fe, and Fe with Ni. Which indicates a strong relation between Cr, Pb and Cd and between Ni, Zn and Fe. Agro-historically, this region has a predominant cropping of dalua rice (summer rice) with minimum plow intervention [35]. It has been recorded that the crop grows within four months, with- out much tending. Other crop types commonly grown in the area are vegetables, pulses, mustard, etc. The present study highlights a high Cr concentration in all the sites following an order of S3 > S1 > S5 > S2 > S4 > C. Geoaccumulation Index indicated the level of contamination of PTEs across the sites (Fig. 2).
