 as animal feeds which may be linked with cropping of each locality.   To solve fodder issues, identification and mapping of available land, feasibilities of fodder crops cultivation, both in valley and hill areas mainly, fallow foot hills are necessary for development of intensive fodder production activities. Dairy cooperative societies, farmers clubs, district councils, village level small milk production units may be entrusted to manage with available spaces for growing fodder by providing skill oriented managerial trainings and provision of inputs like fodder seeds, organic/chemical fertilizers and insecticides, pesticides, etc. 362 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022   Strengthening of district level disease diagnostic and improving of health care and management facilities through regular deworming, vaccination at regular interval to protect from disease outbreaks and timely intervention as well as treatment of ailing animals after confirmative diagnosis. Local veterinary dispensaries and hospitals should be well equipped for timely management during adverse situations as well as facilities for mobile clinic round the clock to minimise any kind of health related accidents/problems.   In poultry the state has a high shortage of poultry products, particularly eggs. High cost of production due to high cost of concentrate feeds, lack of scientific manpower, losses due to diseases are the constraints for ensuring a remunerative income to the poultry farmers. To minimise the cost of production, all sorts of production components, transportation cost, timely availability of veterinary aids including, vaccines, medicines, mineral mixtures, and other poultry equipments, etc. must be ensured at the door step of the rearers.   Like in dairy sector, effort must be made to encourage contract farming in the state for commercial production of feed ingredients such as maize, wheat, soya bean, etc.   To ensure higher income, rearing of low input high output birds, like dual purpose breeds viz.,Giriraja/Vanaraja/Gramapriya/Kruoiler/FFGN/Gramapariya/Srinidhi/CARI Shyama/ Priya/Nirbheek/Devendra/ Kamarupa, etc., may be encouraged in rural hill areas where the vegetation are available under rural poultry farming. Due to lower mortality, higher life time production, more meat acceptability, farmers’ income will be enhanced.   Ensure regular monitoring of diseases and prompt treatment of observed cases.   Being the most important livestock for hills and valley areas, pig production may be prioritised for doubling the farmer’s income.   For enhancing piggery development in the state, more breeding farms for multiplication of piglets/pork production should be established under sustainable conditions with the expert guidance of breeding professional.   Utilisation of non-conventional feed resources, such as wild colocassia, banana stem, tapioca, kitchen waste and value addition therein.
