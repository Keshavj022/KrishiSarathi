 More than half of the bird species in North America and nearly 20% in Europe have experienced rapid declines since the 1970s and 1980s, respectively (Burns et al., 2021; Rosenberg et al., 2019). These declines have been par- ticularly severe in open ecosystems, affecting farmland, grassland, and migratory birds (Gregory et al., 2019; Lees et al., 2022). Grasslands cover over one-third of Earth’s terres- trial land (Bardgett et al., 2021; Suttie et al., 2005; Wilsey, 2018). For centuries human activities have shaped grasslands; initially through traditional, subsis- tence agriculture including livestock grazing, hay har- vest, and over the past century by intensive agriculture (Bardgett et al., 2021). As grasslands worldwide are increasingly converted into pastures, croplands, and plantations, agricultural developments pose a major threat to their avian biodiversity (Douglas et al., 2023; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2024; Squires et al., 2018). For example, agri- cultural intensification, habitat loss, and fragmentation of the breeding grounds have driven the decline of songbird populations in the North American prairies (Mahony et al., 2022; Shahan et al., 2017). In South Ameri- can Pampas, cropland expansions on former grasslands and annual crop cultivation are associated with a lower richness of bird species (Codesido et al., 2008; Schrag et al., 2009). Land cover composition and configuration are crucial factors that decide biodiversity response in agri- cultural landscapes. Grassland and farmland bird species benefit from mosaic landscapes that include heteroge- neous habitats composing seminatural cover, fallows, and diverse crops (Klein et al., 2023; Santana et al., 2017). While such mosaic landscapes are not equal replacements for original grassland habitats, they support higher biodi- versity compared with homogeneous agricultural land- scapes (Fahrig et al., 2011; Sirami et al., 2019). In the tropics particularly, composition and configurational complexity in agroforestry and traditional livestock sys- tems benefit avian diversity (Velasquez Valencia & Bonilla Gomez, 2019). Compositionally heterogeneous agricultural land- scapes can influence the richness and abundance of grassland bird species based on habitat or diet guild requirements (Hertzog et al., 2023). Across European agricultural landscapes, farmland bird populations ben- efit from open-ground patches, hedges, traditional orchards, and grassland patches (Laiolo, 2005; Rösch et al., 2023). The inclusion of foraging crops in agricul- tural composition and the presence of seminatural cover such as fallows and patches of grasslands surrounding agriculture can have a positive impact on birds of the open land (Frei et al., 2018; Klein et al., 2023; Santana et al., 2017). Likewise, higher configurational complex- ity can be a significant driver of avian biodiversity (Frank et al., 2024).
