   In Cauvery Delta Zones, Cu deficiency is widely observed in the soils hence basal soil application of 5 kg CuSO4 ha-1 ha may be followed.   Adopt alternate wetting and drying method-based irrigation schedule   For management of blast: Seed treatment with Bacillus subtilis @ 10g/kg. Upon observing the initial infection of the disease foliar spray with tricyclazole 75 WP @ 500 g/ha or metominostrobin 20 SC @ 500 ml/ha or Azoxystrobin 25 SC @ 500 ml/ha.   For management of False smut: Foliar spray of Propiconazole 25 EC @ 1 ml/lit at boot leaf and milking stage to reduce the infection.   To manage paddy stem borer, foliar spray Chlorantrinilprole 18.5 SC @ 60ml/ac during morning hours (or) spray Acephate 75 % SP @ 670-1000 g/hectare   To manage neck blast disease during panicle maturity stage, foliar spray of Propiconazole 25 EC @ 200ml/ac of water during morning hours ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 160   For acid soils apply lime based on the soil analysis for obtaining normal rice yields. Lime is applied 2.5 t/ha before last ploughing.   Management of alkalinity: Soil application of gypsum @ 500 kg/ha, application of CaSO4 @ 5 kg/ha for arresting algae growth, reduced/no application of Phosphatic fertilizers and 25% higher dose of urea and potash fertilizers.   Apply N and K @ 25% each at 21 DAS, active tillering, PI and heading stages. If N is applied through LCC, use the critical value 4 for line sown drill seeded rice. Entire P as basal, applied in the last plough or at the time of incorporation of green manure/ compost.   Grow Cowpea as border crop for attracting Beneficial insects Wet seeded puddled Lowland Rice   Apply N and K @ 25% each at 21 DAS, at active tillering, PI and heading stages.   If N is applied through LCC, use the critical value 4 for line sown drill seeded rice.   Apply entire P as basal in the last plough or at the time of incorporation of green manure/ compost. Dry seeded Rainfed Un-Puddled Lowland Rice   Blanket recommendation: 50:25:25 kg N:P2O5:K2O /ha   Apply a basal dose of 750 kg of FYM enriched with fertilizer phosphorus (P at 25 kg/ha)   Apply N and K in two equal splits at 20 - 25 and 40 - 45 days after germination.   If the moisture availability from the tillering phase is substantial, three splits (25 kg N and 12.5 kg K at 20-25, 40-45 and 60-65 DAG) can be adopted.   Basal application of FeSO4 at 50 kg/ha is desirable for iron deficient soil (or) apply TNAU Rainfed rice MN mixture @12.5 kg/ha as EFYM at 1:10 ratio incubated for 30 days at friable moisture. Semidry / Rainfed rice   Apply 25 kg ZnSO4 ha-1 and 50 kg FeSO4 ha-1 along with available organic manure when the soil is deficient in Zn or Fe.   After the establishment of crop, if the deficiency is observed in plants foliar spraying of 0.50% ZnSO4 or 1.0% FeSO4 + 0.10% citric acid on 15, 25 & 35 DAS may be given for alleviating the respective nutrient deficiencies.
