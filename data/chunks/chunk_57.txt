 This requires a paradigm shift in technology development and deployment besides commercialization along with capacity building of the stakeholders. Exploitation of available yield reserves to realise higher production and genetic enhancement for yield and quality would be a critical factor in raising the productivity. The supply projections of NITI Aayog projected availability of 33.95 million tonnes of pulses in 2032-33 which implies a deficit of about 1.28 million tonnes. Given the present trends of growth in pulses production, this seems to be achievable with utilization and exploration of all opportunities to enhance the pulses production. In the follow up, the innovative cluster approach of demonstration in moth bean was initiated in Rajasthan for achieving higher production of pulses in the state. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Demand and supply projection of pulses Supply (million tonnes) Imports (` '000 crore) Imports (million tonnes) Demand (million tonnes) Fig. 1.

Source: NITI Aayog, 2018 Cluster frontline demonstrations (CFLDs) A special programme for demonstration of new varieties through Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVKs) to promote adoption of new varieties of pulses was initiated under National Food Security Mission (NFSM) through a collaborative project of ICAR-DAFW in 2016-17. CFLDs is an innovation over individual and isolated FLDs and technology application research for popularization of the latest notified/released varieties along with full package of practices on a cluster of farmers’ fields of a village or more villages. This enables to demonstrate the potentiality of the technologies with scale to participating farmers as well as the farmers of adjacent villages and other agencies. The robustness of precision in outcomes of technology dissemination is enhanced due to economy of scale so is the opportunities for performance analysis and the feedback of practitioners. The frontline extension agencies in Rajasthan under ICAR-ATARI, Jodhpur have been implementing CFLDs on mothbean. During 2022, CFLDs on 340 ha involving 840 farmers were conducted in stressed districts of Bikaner, Barmer, Churu, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Nagaur in western Rajasthan. Full packages of practices of mothbean including newly developed varieties, sowing methods, seed treatment, integrated nutrient management (INM), use of micronutrients, bio-fertilizers, integrated pest and diseases management and intercropping, etc. were implemented. The attributes of demonstrated varieties of mothbean are presented in Table 2. CFLD on Mothbean variety RMO 257 at farmer's field in Nagaur district, Rajasthan Table 1.
