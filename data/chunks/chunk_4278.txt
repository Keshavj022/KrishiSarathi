 Different nutrient’s deficiency can be rectified by spraying 19:19:19 @ 2.5 g and Grade-IV (Zn 6 %, Fe 4 %, Mn 1 %, Cu 0.5 % and B 0.5 %) @ 1 g /l of water along with silicon spreader at 20 DAS. a b Rabi onion CV. NHRDF Red 4 seedlings ready for transplanting Dipping onion seedling’s root in the solution of carbendazim 1 g and carbosulfan 2 ml/l of water before transplanting is recommended to control pest and diseases.

NHRDF Red 4 field Nutritional deficiency (Yellowing) Indian Horticulture 38 This farmer was advised to apply FYM @ 25 t/ha and a fertilizer dose of 100:50:50 kg N:P2O5:K2O/ha. Half dose of N and full dose of P2O5 and K2O is to be applied as basal dose. The remaining dose of N is to be applied in two equal splits at 30 and 45 DAT. Apply sulphur 20- 40 kg/ha before transplanting. Apply Azotobacter 5 kg, Phosphorus Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) 5 kg and Trichoderma 1.25 kg/ha with vermicompost or FYM generally after one week of basal RDF application. If plant showed deficiency symptoms of micronutrients, spray Grade-IV (Zn 6 %, Fe 4 %, Mn 1 %, Cu 0.5 % and B 0.5 %) @ 2 g/l of water at 30 and 45 days after transplanting along with silicon spreader. Apply oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC @ 1-1.5 ml/l of water before transplanting or within week after transplanting followed by one hand weeding (HW) at 30 DAT. Or apply of oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC at 1-1.5 ml and quizalofop ethyl 5% EC at 1 ml/l of water at 25 DAT followed by one HW at 45 DAT. Seedlings dipping treatment is recommended at the time of transplanting. This farmer was advised to apply Trichoderma spp. 1.25 kg/ha with neem cake or vermicompost. Spray mancozeb 2.5 g + fipronil 1 ml/l water at appearance of pest and disease, propiconazole 1 ml + carbosulfan 2 ml/l water at 45 DAT and copper oxychloride 2.5 g + profenofos 1 ml/ l water along with sticker at 60 DAT as per pest and disease intensity. View of weed controlled field after spray Spraying of oxyfluorfen 1-1.5 ml/L at 3 DAT Outcome Bulb maturity is dependent upon variety, soil, climate etc. Generally bulbs become ready for harvest 110-130 DAT.
