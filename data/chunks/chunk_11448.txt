 For the YAAS affected saline lands, the salt tolerant crops like bitter gourd, ash gourd, beet, tomato, palak, cabbage, cauliflower, knolkhol and dolichos bean would be best choice. Dolichos bean may be a good choice, as it has long cropping period. The crop must be sown by May-June and it needs harvesting and marketing of produce from October onward upto February-March. In each case seed priming using Chlormequat Chloride (Cycocel) @ 50 ppm for 8 hrs or 1% solution of KNO3 (prepare a solution of soluble fertilizer 13:0:45 @ 10g/lt) for 1-2 hour is advised for better germination, seedling vigour and developing crop resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses. To increase net return, input cost must be minimized. Use of homemade manure (organic manure), neem pesticide and bio- ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 210 fungicide (Trichoderma) will not only minimize cost of cultivation, but also will help to have better crop stand and better production. To get healthy crop with more self-defense against pests and diseases, use as much organic manure as possible (minimum 1q / cottah). Minimize dependence on inorganic fertilizers. Before land preparation, apply lime @ 2 kg/cottah, which will minimize soil borne disease problem maintain soil pH and enrich soil Ca content. For healthy seedling growth of each vegetable, spray soluble fertilizer 12:61:0 @ 3g/lt upon 12-15 days old seedlings. Repeat after 7 days. Use the same fertilizer solution (12:61:0 @ 3g/lt) at the root zone, immediately after transplanting of seedlings of tomato, chilli, cole vegetables etc. Repeat the same at 2 – 3 days interval. For better nutrient management of vegetable crops, use soluble fertilizers like 19:19:19 or 20:20:20 @ 3 to 5g/lt as much as possible at 7 – 10 days interval. For better growth and yield in vegetable crops, micronutrient plays a vital role. For better micronutrient management, apply Mixed Micronutrient (Grade 5) @ 1.5 to 2 g/lt as spray at 15 to 20 days interval. To increase plant defence against biotic and abiotic stresses, use soluble fertilizer 13:0:45 @ 3 to 5 g/lt starting from flowering to fruiting stage, regularly at 15 to 20 days interval. To increase female flower count as well as yield in cucurbit vegetables (like bitter gourd, cucumber), spray Ethrel (or ethepon 39.5% SL) @ 0.4 ml/lt twice at 2 and 4 true leaf stage. To improve fruit setting and to minimize flower or immature fruit drop in tomato, chilli, brinjal, Dolichos bean, cowpea, cucurbits spray soluble B (Boron 20%) @ 1.5g/lt and NAA 4.5% W/W (Planofix) @ 0.2 ml/lt, alternately at 10-12 days interval. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 211 Mango, Guava & Litchi: Fruit drops in all the three crops can be managed by spray of NAA 4.5% W/W (Planofix) @ 0.3 ml/lt at 10-12 days interval. For better fruit development, spray n-triacontanol (Miraculan) @ 0.5 ml/lt at 15 days interval. Keep sufficient moisture in the orchard basin.
