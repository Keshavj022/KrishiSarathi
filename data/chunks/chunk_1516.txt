 Indian Farming 42 January 2025 IFS Model for rainfed conditions of Tamil Nadu An integrated approach with crop + goat (4) + poultry (20) + sheep (6) + dairy (1) achieved the highest income of `17,598/ha/year, followed by a crop + goat + poultry + dairy model (`14,208/ha/year), while the conventional system having crop cultivation alone gave a net income of only 2,057/ha/year. In this system, employment increased from 185 person-days/ha/year in conventional systems to 389 person-days/ha/year with IFS. Benefits of rainfed IFS Increased resilience: By diversifying income sources and reducing dependence on a single crop, rainfed IFS builds resilience against weather fluctuations, pests, and market risks. This is crucial for farming communities vulnerable to droughts and erratic rainfall. Enhanced resource-use efficiency: The integrated nature of IFS allows for better recycling of resources, where outputs from one component (like livestock manure) become inputs for another (such as crop fertilization), minimizing waste and lowering input costs. Economic stability: Rainfed IFS models generate multiple income streams, thereby stabilizing farmers’ earnings throughout the year. Income from horticulture, livestock, and aquaculture complements seasonal crop revenues, ensuring financial security even during challenging times. Employment generation: The integration of various activities provides year-round employment opportunities for farm families and rural labourers, reducing seasonal migration and enhancing rural livelihoods. Environmental sustainability: Rainfed IFS promotes practices that enhance soil health, improve biodiversity, and lower environmental impacts. Techniques like crop rotation, mixed cropping, and agroforestry conserve soil and water resources and encourage sustainable land use. Food and nutritional security: Rainfed IFS not only provides a variety of food products (cereals, pulses, fruits, vegetables, and livestock products) but also improves household nutrition, which is vital in rural areas with limited access to diversified diets. *Corresponding author email: Raghavendra.Singh@icar.gov.in Major components of rainfed IFS models 2057 8274 14208 7265 17598 185 297 343 343 389 Crop alone Crop + goat + poultry Crop + goat + poultry + dairy Crop + goat + poultry + sheep Crop + goat + poultry + sheep + dairy Net income (₹/ha/year) Employment (Person-day/ha/year) Income and employment generation potential of different farming system models at Tamil Nadu (Source: Chary et al. 2022) Indian Farming 43 January 2025 Transforming arid lands into profit Dryland horticulture insights Prakash Patil* and Vani N.
