 This makes irregular feeding marks on the leaves and flowers. It causes up to 20% damage to groundnut in many parts of the groundnut growing areas. The incidence of leafminer (Aproaerema modicella) was also recorded. A field experiment was cnducted with the following 3 treatments: (a) Prosopis juliflora leaf extract spray, (b) Spray of Endosulfan 35EC (0.07%), and (c) Untreated check. Each treatment was put in an area of 2 cents with seven replications. Endosperm and leaf extract of Prosopis juliflora were sprayed thrice at 15 days interval. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study As a result of the unstructured interview that was conducted, the following observations were made on how to prepare and use the leaf extract. Prosopis juliflora leaves collected and ground well with water. The filtrate is taken separately. Then 200 ml extract was mixed with water to make up into one spray tank. Hand spray or power spray are used to spray in the field. Spraying continued with an interval of 15 days until it got cured. This resulted in minimizing damage of Fig. 1. Relative performance of Prosopis juliflora leaf extract on groundnut pest control Fig. 2. Relative performance of Prosopis juliflora leaf extract on groundnut yield  PEST AND DISEASE MANGEMENT groundnut , caused by Helicoverpa armigera. The matrix scores shown in Figs 1 and 2 indicate the relative performance of Prosopis juliflora leaf extract on control of pest and yield of groundnut. The results obtained suggest that leaf extract of Prosopis juliflora is more effective in control of Helicoverpa than other pests. Its application also improves the yield of ground as compared to chemical treatment. The results obtained (Tables 1 and 2) show that spraying of Endosulfan at 0.07% was highly effective against Helicoverpa armigera and surul poochi (Aproaerema modicella) in groundnut by recording very low population as compared to the other two treatments. Spray of Prosopis juliflora leaf extract recorded higher larval population, which was on a par with that of untreated check. Hence spraying of Prosopis juliflora leaf extract three times at 15 days interval was not effective Table 2.
