BAU Therapeutic trials: The clinical trial was conducted in 30 goats having parasitic and non- parasitic diarrhoea. These were divided into 3 different treatment groups, each consisting of 10 animals. Group I (non-parasitic diarrhoea) was given shisham leaf paste orally 30 g twice daily for 3 days. Group II (parasitic diarrhoea) received Fazole – 1/2 bolous twice a day for 3 days and Panacur @ 5 mg/kg body weight single dose. Group III (parasitic diarrhea) received shisham leaf paste orally @ 30 g twice daily and Panacur 5 mg/kgbody weight single dose. In severely dehydrated cases 5% dextrose was also infused. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Therapeutic efficacy: At IVRI, the trial was conducted in 30 young calves (<2 months old). The fecal examination revealed no parasitic Table 9.
