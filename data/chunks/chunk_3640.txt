CONCLUSION Development of new varieties with conventional breeding methods, development of new production and protection and post-harvest technologies and value additions are the ongoing programme in all the major crops which are essential to keep up the pace of the current growth of horticulture section. Apart from new programmes such as Genome editing for quality storability and disease pests resistance, clean planting material production, digital horticulture, high value export oriented crops, etc. The present steps should be continued to boost productivity in the Northeastern region. Apart from these, development of climate resilient varieties and technologies of major horticultural crops, production large scale, clean production material to fulfilling the demands for replanting and new areas expansion, emphasis on cleaner and safer production for domestic, export market, and promotion of export oriented high value crops should be given greater emphasis for the Northeastern region.
