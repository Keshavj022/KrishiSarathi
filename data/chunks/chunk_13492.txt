95 (highest) in Bagalkot District, with a mean agricultural efficiency index of 108.50 in Karnataka (Fig. 2a; Table 2). Significantly, Figure 2a and Table 2 revealed that Dharwad (73.69), Uttar Kannad (75.09), Kodagu (88.46), and Kolar (81.08) districts were characterized by low agricultural efficiency index. In contrast, Davangere, Chikmagalur, Hassan, and Mandya districts formed a belt of high agricultural efficiency index, which extended from the lower central Karnataka to the southern Karnataka. Furthermore, agricultural efficiency index during 2018–2019 revealed distinct spatial patterns, spanning from 42.30 in Gadag District to 146.41 in Gulbarga District, with a mean agricultural efficiency index of 98.96 in the study area (Fig. 2b; Table 2). The north-central Karnataka and south-central Karnataka exhibited low agricultural efficiency index, underscoring variation over time. Figure 2 and Table 2 highlighted that Yadgir and Bagalkot districts in the northern region of Karnataka, along with a belt of five adjacent districts comprising Chikmagalur, Udupi, Dakshin Kannad, Mysore, and Kodagu from southwestern Karnataka had medium agricultural efficiency index. Regions characterized by very high agricultural efficiency index (>130.00) were predominantly located in the northern Karnataka, covering Belgaum and Gulbarga districts. Table 2 unveiled a diverse pattern of inter-district variation, with a substantial increase (40.24) of agricultural efficiency index in Belgaum District and a noteworthy decrease (–111.18) in Bagalkot District. S. DAS, et al.: Spatio-temporal variation and relationship between agricultural... Regional Sustainability (2024) 5(2) 100144 7 Fig. 2. Spatio-temporal distribution of agricultural efficiency index in Karnataka during 2004–2005 (a) and 2018–2019 (b), and difference value of agricultural efficiency index between 2004–2005 and 2018–2019 (c). Positive variation in agricultural efficiency index was predominantly observed in western Karnataka (Fig. 2c; Table 2). Gulbarga, Yadgir, and Belgaum districts had highly positive variation of agricultural efficiency index (>20.00), signaling substantial advancements in agricultural efficiency. Additionally, Uttar Kannad, Bellary, Shimoga, Chamarajanagar, and Kodagu districts exhibited moderately positive variation of agricultural efficiency index (10.00–20.00), indicating significant enhancements in agricultural efficiency. Moreover, Dakshin Kannad and Udupi districts in southwestern Karnataka displayed a lowly positive variation of agricultural efficiency index. Negative variation in agricultural efficiency was widespread in northern and southern Karnataka. As highlighted in Table 2, the negative agricultural efficiency index ranged from –111.18 in Bagalkot District to –1.20 in Kolar District during 2004–2005. Bagalkot, Bidar, Raichur, Bijapur, Gadag, Koppal, Hassan, Chitradurga, Bengaluru Urban, and Chikballapur districts were characterized by highly negative variation (> –20.
