It is particularly useful as a maintenance drug. It is effective in cases of oedema and ascites resulting from early cirrhosis of the liver and chronic peritonitis. The plant is reported to be efficaceous in abdominal tumours and cancer. It is also credited with anti- bacterial and cardiotonic properties. An anti-viral agent, active against spherical and tubular viruses, was isolated from the roots, including systemic resistance in plants. The herb including the roots is eaten as a vegetable in curries and soups. The roots and seeds are added to cereal, pancakes and other food.
