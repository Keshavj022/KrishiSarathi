It has a huge potential for promoting agri-based innovations that promise solutions to many of the current challenges faced by the sector. Till recently agricultural innovations of Indian has mainly been driven by public sector. The National Agricultural Research and Education System (NARES) is a major stakeholder in agricultural research with a focus on technology creation and its delivery to other stakeholders such as farmers, producer groups, retailers, corporations, civil societies and private players. The current needs of the stakeholders warrant NARES to transform into a more pluralistic innovation system addressing the needs of the consumers. The success of these technologies can also enhance incomes of the stakeholders including farmers. It is important that these innovative technologies, processes and products from the NARES system utilize in such a way that efficiency in agri-economic system is significantly enhances. The NARES, therefore is, gradually started shifting from 'a supply-driven to demand driven and market-led' agricultural innovation system, involving different stakeholders.
