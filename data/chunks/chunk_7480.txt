Developed following web resources as R Module for (a) Construction of Orthogonal and Nested Orthogonal Latin Hypercube Designs (http://drsr.icar.gov.in/OLH/) consisting of four different modules for generation, viz (i) 1st order OLH design, (ii) 2nd order OLH design, (iii) Nested OLH design, and (iv) OLH design with good space filling property; and (b) Incomplete Split Plot Designs: Construction and Analysis (http:// drsr.icar.gov.in/ISPD/). This web service gives facility ISS Web Portal – Home/Login Comparative analysis of publications in Web of Science: A comparative publication analysis of ICAR vis-à-vis CIMMYT, IRRI, ICRISAT, INRAE, France; CAAS, China; EMBRAPA, Brazil; AAFC, Canada and CSIRO, Australia during 2010–2019 was carried out using the data retrieved from Web of Science Core Collection Citation Indexes (http://webofknowledge. com) as on 16.04.2020 and 29.05.2020. The report consisted of number of publications, average citations, h-index year-wise as well as for two quinquennial periods (2010–14; 2015-19). The number of publications with at least 100 or 50 citations was obtained. This also includes comparison (a) based on 500 most cited papers each year, 1,000 most cited papers and 2,025 most cited papers; (b) Average citation(s) per publication of (i) 2,000 publications by taking 200 most cited papers per year; and (ii) 5,000 publications by taking 500 most cited papers per year. The study was carried out by ICAR- IASRI and ICAR-NAARM jointly. ICAR research data repository for knowledge management: KRISHI-Agricultural Knowledge Resources and Information System Hub for Innovation portal is serving as a gateway to online resources available at different ICAR Institutes to enhance visibility and easy access of digital outputs of ICAR to stakeholders.
