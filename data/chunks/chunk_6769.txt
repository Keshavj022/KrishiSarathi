 28-times higher than red/orange/yellow carrots. VRCAR 252 and its maintainer are ideally synchronous in flowering/pollination activities which facilitate proper pollination and maximum seed set in CMS line. Castor (Ricinus communis) IC638880 21157 Resistance to leafhopper (Empoasca flavescens).Resistance to thrips (Scirtothrips dorsalis). IC0642011 21230 Dwarf pistillate line with condensed internodes, convergent branching, cup shaped leaves. Loose spike. Resistant to Fusarium wilt and leafhopper Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) IC0642000 21217 Resistant to black rot disease (Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris race 1). Carries single dominant resistant gene. IC0642001 21218 PC 1 is a new genotype of Purple Sicilian type (an intermediate type of cauliflower and broccoli) which produces attractive purple curds with light green stalks.The purple curding phenotype is governed by a single locus Pr with incomplete dominance but different from purple cauliflower. ‘PC- 1’ curds are rich in anthocyanin (40.6±2.74 mg/100g FW) and mature in December month and produce seed profusely in sub-tropical condition. IC643987 22047 Highly resistant to downy mildew disease (c.o. Hyaloperonospora parasitica). Carry single dominant gene Ppa207 for downy mildew resistance. The resistant gene Ppa 207 was mapped in 4.8 cM linkage interval on linkage group 2 (C02) of cauliflower, flanked by the markers BoGMS0486 and BoGMS0900 at 3.6 and 1.2 cM, respectively. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) EC267301 21137 Ascochyta blight resistance. IC248147 21138 Ascochyta blight resistance. IC640699 21141 Three seeds per pod in ~30% pods per plant with a mean of 2.62 seeds/ pod. Bushy plant architecture with semi erect canopy and basal branching pattern. Derived from wide hybridization of Cicer arietinum and Cicer echinospermum (donor). Seeds are yellow, angular in shape and small in size (13.7 g hundred seed weight). IC640700 21142 Tolerance to post emergent herbicide Imazethapyr (1.5X @ 150g a.i./ ha) with > 85% of survival and seed setting. Minimum phenological shift in the crop growth with respect to the unsprayed control. Matures in 127-130 days with the unsprayed crop with <5% yield penalty. IC272450 21144 Heat tolerant. Chilli (Capsicum annuum) IC631915 21154 Stalklessness or non-persistent calyx in red ripened fruit of chilli. Erect bearing habit. High yield. IC631916 21155 Stalklessness or non-persistent calyx in red ripened fruit of chilli. Pendent bearing habit. High yield and resistant to chilli leaf curl complex. IC0642004 21219 Resistant to chilli veinal mottle virus disease. Good general combiner for yield and quality traits. China aster (Callistephus chinensis) IC0624508 21166 Flower colour (Red Purple group, 65D, Fan 2). Long flower stalk (47.67 cm). Long vase life (10.11 days). Cotton (Gossypium barbadense) IC0641999 21212 Cleistogamous flower. Prominent boll tip. Three locule bolls.
