The porosity of soil was thus high, especially in the top 30 cm soil layer. Consequently, the soil is highly permeable for water, and hence well drained. The infiltration rate of soil (after 6 hr of initiation of infiltration process) varied between 5,379 and 7,005 mm/day. The water-retention capacity of soil is relatively poor due to high sand content. RESULTS Stability of terraces and trenches Land shaping (trenching and terracing) was done in October-November 2002. Due to fragile nature of landscape and heavy snowfall during winters, the terracing was severely damaged, and had to be reconstructed after 11/2 years. The width of the terraces was significantly reduced from 1.5 m to 0.5 m. The depth of trenches on an average decreased Table 3.

The average depth of trenches under different land-shaping treatments after 17 and 22 months of their construction is shown in Table 3. The depth was reduced to the extent that it needed repair. Therefore trenches need to be frequently repaired in fragile and erosion-prone soils. In spite of the damage done to the terraces and trenches due to rainfall and snow, the moisture conservation due to these land-shaping treatments encouraged the growth of natural vegetation. After the rainy season, the terraces provided with trenches showed profuse growth of grasses and leguminous vines due to profile water conservation. It would help in soil conservation and add organic matter to the soil upon its decay. Soil-moisture conservation An amount of 1,500-1,600 mm rainfall was received during 2003 (January-December), and 1,100-1,200 mm during 2004 (January September). The potential evaporation for the same period was 850-1,000 mm and 600-700 mm, respectively. Effect of land-shaping The effect of land-shaping treatments on soil- moisture conservation is shown in Table 4. Land shaping had significant effect on soil-moisture conservation. Soil moisture in all soil layers and at all dates was significantly higher in plant basins Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Table 4.
