 Cricket Ball, trees recorded higher yield (35.50 kg/ tree with 375 fruits/tree having 80.00 g fruit weight) compared with the control (18.50 kg/tree with 280 fruits/tree having 68.50 g fruit weight) at Arabhavi. Similarly, at Gandevi, rejuvenation of 36-year-old trees of sapota cv. Kalipatti by topping terminal growth of 1.0 m recorded higher yield of 178.27 kg/tree with 2,790 fruits/tree having fruit weight of 64.1 g as compared to the control (138.0 kg/tree with 2,225 OVERVIEW DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 5 fruits/tree having 62.0 g fruit weight). In rabi season, integrated application of NADEP compost @ 25 tonnes/ ha + biofertilizer (PSB+Azotobacter/Rhizobium) increased the yield of cabbage and pea by 12.8 and 23.5 %, respectively, over the conventional inorganic system. Drip irrigation in cassava at 100% of cumulative pan evaporation (CPE) resulted in 400% increase in tuber yield of cassava (44 tonnes/ha) compared to the rainfed crop (11 tonnes/ha) in summer. It resulted in 30% increase in tuber yield and 50% saving in water consumption compared to surface irrigation. The insect- proof net covering walk-in-tunnel gave maximum seed yield of 22.7, 25.4 and 8.2 q/ha in fennel, dill and cumin, whereas plastic sheet covered walk-in-tunnel gave maximum seed yield of 28.73 q/ha in fenugreek. Vertical walls of plastic sheet were also effective to reduce the frost damage and improve seed yield of coriander and fenugreek. The green and black shaded net were more effective for production of off-season leafy coriander and fenugreek than white and red shaded nets in June and July. The DMRO 327 was the best strain of mushroom with maximum BE of 60.23%. The production technology of king oyster on saw dust based substrate supplemented with organic nitrogen materials with a biological efficiency of 30% was standardized. Nine out of 13 bee species as active pollinators of cashew are wild bee. The CIARI Bio- Consortia was tested in different field conditions for management of bacterial wilt in brinjal. An entomopathogenic fungus, Lecanicillium psalliotae, is so far the first report on its application in management of cardamom thrips in India. It is recommended as 3- 4 times soil application during May – September, for effective control of thrips. Livestock management: Distillers’ grains (DG) are considered a good sources of protein for dairy cattle, and can replace the protein source in their diets. The supplementation of molasses based multi-nutrient supplement (MMS) (250 g/buffalo/day) improved milk yield by 16-18% and can replace 7.5% concentrate mixture without having any adverse effect on lactating Murrah buffaloes. Supplementation of 10% linseed and 5% Ca-soap in the diet of finisher lambs significantly increased ω-3 fatty acids and CLA content in adipose tissue and in Longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of lambs. CLA enriched mutton possesses numerous health benefits, including anti-cancer properties.
