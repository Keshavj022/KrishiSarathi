 According to the cross-indicator analysis, the main inﬂuencing indicators responsible for higher social security in SPHR compared to EHR include higher knowledge sharing among farmers, younger and larger working population, higher remittance from relatives, and relatively higher membership in agricultural credit societies. In SPHR, over 37.00% of farmers communicate with other farmers regarding farm management, while just approxi- mately 9.00% of farmers consult with others in EHR. Also, it was discovered that more than 80.00% of people are between the age of 15 and 45 in SPHR, while the statistics result is just 36.00% in EHR. Approximately 20.00% of farmers are members of agricultural credit societies in SPHR, but just about 3.00% of farmers are in EHR. Farmers enjoy greater social security in SPHR than farmers in EHR and other agro-climatic regions. 3.4. Agricultural sustainability index Among the 14 mainstream agro-climatic regions of India, TGPR gets the highest score of agricultural sustainability, while EHR gets the lowest (Table 5). While environmental sustainability index of EHR is rather high, social and economic security indices are quite poor, placing the region at the bottom of agricultural sustainability ranking. This shows how important it is to involve social and economic contexts in discussing agricultural sustainability. Given the complexity and diversity of Indian society, it is social structure that ulti- mately deﬁnes the country’s economic and ecological well-being. Higher livestock ownership, cropping intensity, per capita income, irrigation intensity, access of transportation facilities, share of institutional credit, food grain productivity, crop diversiﬁcation, awareness of minimum support price, knowledge sharing with fellow Table 5 Rank of the 14 agro-climatic regions of India in agricultural sustainability.

Except the disparity between TGPR and EHR in economic security dimension, the results of cross-indicator analysis show that more than 90.00% of farmers in TGPR own livestock, while only 57.
