 For Maize crop land preparation can be done by giving at least 3 deep ploughing followed by sowing of maize @ 20-22 kg seed/ha and maintain spacing 60 cm x 20 cm @ 3-4 cm deep. Maize is a highly lime responsive crop, so application of lime is recommended by following Proper Soil Testing Procedure. Apply FYM or compost 5 tonne / ha during field preparation and N: P: K @ 120: 60: 40 kg/ha. Entire dose of P & K with 1/3rd of N should be applied at the time of sowing. Application of 25 Kg of ZnSO4 at sowing is also recommended since maize is susceptible to Zn deficiency. Rest split doses of N should be applied at knee-high and tasselling stages. The most critical stage for irrigation in Rabi Maize is flowering period (15-20 days) including tasselling, silking & pollination. Greatest decrease in grain yield is caused by water deficits during these stages, mainly due to the reduction in grain number of cobs. Ensure proper irrigation during these stages of Rabi Maize. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 298 Mustard & Toria Different varieties like TRC-t-1-1-5-1, TRS –Y-01-5-1-1, TRS –Y- 01-2-2-1, SCRT 1-2-1, SCRT 1-2-3, NRCHB-101, TS 67, TS 38 are potential variety for Tripura. A seed rate of 700-900 gm/kani is sown in rows of 30-40 cm and plant to plant distance of 10-15 cm apart. NPK fertilizer of 40, 20, 20kg/ha for toria and 90:60:40 for mustard may be applied for better growth and yield. Foliar application of 0.1% boron and 0.5% ZnSO4 in between flowering to pod formation may increase grain size and oil content. The most serious insect-pest of mustard is aphids. To control aphids organically the spraying of derisom or neem oil @ 2.5 gm or ml/lit of water two to three times are required. Use yellow sticky trap @ 20 to 25 nos/ha. If require, Thiamethoxam 25WG or Clothianidin 50 WDG may also be sprayed to control pest in mustard chemically. Field Pea Sowing time of pea under Tripura condition is 1st fortnight of November. Seed inoculation with Biofertlizers PSB and Rhizobium @ 40 gm/ kg seed mixed in jaggery solution and dried in shade before sowing. Apply Lime @ 200 kg/ha or dolomite 400 kg/ha after clearing the field 15 to 20 days before sowing. NPK fertilizer of 20: 60: 40 kg/kani may be applied for better crop yield. A light irrigation may be provided at flowering initiation stage for better pod formation. Spraying of 0.1% boron in between flowering to pod formation stage is beneficial. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 299 Panchagavya/vermiwash may be applied as foliar spray at fortnightly intervals as of growth promoter to enhance marketable yield. Lentil Sowing of lentil should be completed by 15th November to get good yield. Land is prepared by one ploughing and two harrowing WBL-77, WBL-58, HUL-57 are the suitable varieties of lentil under Tripura condition. Apply 20:40:20 kg NPK /ha and 2-3 MT FYM/ha. Seed should be treated with rhizobiam and PSB culture 20 g per kg of seed.
