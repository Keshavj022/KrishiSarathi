 In CT, the traditional farmers' practice was adopted for primary tillage with a tractor-drawn tyne cultivator was used six times for ploughing (12–14 cm average tillage depth), followed by secondary tillage for seedbed preparation and manual broadcasting of wheat and maize seeds during rabi and kharif seasons respective. In RT, a tractor-drawn tyne cultivator was used three times (9–11 cm average tillage depth), followed by planking, and here, wheat was sown using a seed drill, and maize was sown by manual broadcasting. In the case of a ZT, a seed drill was used for sowing seeds without much physical disturbance to the soil directly. In all the treatments, the crops were grown in rainfed conditions. An average total residue of 5.09, 5.58, and 6.94 t ha−1 yr−1 from grass, stubble, and root mass were integrated into the field for the CT, RT, and ZT treatments, respectively. The topsoil layer (0 to 10 cm) had a pH (1: 2.5) of 5.4, EC of 0.09 dSm−1, SOC Fig. 1.

The recommended P2O5 and K2O doses were coupled with N (50%) and applied as the initial dose, and the remaining N was administered 30–35 days after sowing (DAS) and 60 DAS of maize, respectively. In the case of wheat, appropriate P2O5 and K2O dosages were mixed with N (50%). The remainder of the N was used during the CRI and booting stages. To reduce weeds in a maize field, pre-emergence herbicides such as Atrazine or Pendimethalin (@ 1.5 kg a.i. ha−1) were applied, whereas 2, 4-D (@ 1.0 kg a.i. ha−1) and isoproturon (@ 0.5 kg a.i. ha−1) were applied after 35–40 DAS in wheat. Precautions have been taken throughout the years to avoid insect infestation and disease outbreaks in maize and wheat. 2.3. Soil sampling and physiochemical soil parameter analysis Soil samples (three replications each) were obtained from all four treatments from 0–5, 5–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–25, and 25–30 cm depths after the harvest of wheat to estimate bulk density, stone weight, MWD (mean weighted diameter), SOC and TN in the laboratory. Individual intact soil samples were collected from each layer using a stainless-steel core (5 cm each in height and internal diameter) and oven-dried for 24 h at 105 ◦C to ensure a consistent dry weight in order to analyze soil bulk density (Blake and Hartge, 1986). Prior to this, rock fragments (>2 mm) were removed by sieving, and the fine soil bulk density was determined by subtracting the air-dried, thoroughly cleaned stone weight from the original soil sample weight and accordingly adjusting the soil volume (density of rock fragment taken as 2.6 g cm−3) (Don et al., 2007).
