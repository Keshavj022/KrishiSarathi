 Total 22 field experiments were conducted at various centres Micronutrient Teprosyn formulations having composition of Teprosyn F‐2498 ( 600 g ZnL‐1), Teprosyn ZnP F‐3090 (300 g Zn + 200 g P205 L‐1) , Teprosyn Mn F‐2157 (500 g Mn L‐1) and Teprosyn Mo F‐1837 (250 g Mo L‐1). Were tested. High quantity of micronutrients is partially dissolved in acid and slurry is prepared to get desired concentration level of micronutrients such as Zn 300‐600 g L‐l, Mn 500 g L‐1 and Mo 250 g L‐1 for seed coating .Result showed that seed treatment with Teprosyn Zn+P at the recommended level (8ml/ kg seed) increased the yields of several crops having bigger seed size and found beneficial. It is not suitable for small seed crops.

Fig. 5.2 Effect of seed treatment with various zinc products on seed yield of sunflower • Thus, considering the benefits accrued from seed coating treatments with above micronutrient formulations, the zinc phosphate (suspension) has been notified in the Fertilizer (Control) Order (FCO) 1985 vide amendment order notification under section 3 of the Essential Commodity Act, 1955 of Govt. of India with following specifications in respect to provisional fertilizer mentioned at sl.no. 3 in the FCO order dated New Delhi 12th May, 2003 with specification as zincated phosphate (suspension), specification under FCO for agricultural use: Total phosphate as P2O5) percent by weight, minimum 300 g Zn L‐1 Total zinc ( as Zn) percent by weight, minimum 200 g P205 L‐1 Neutral Ammonium citrate sulphate phosphate 3.9 % as P2O Lead (as Pb) percent by weight, maximum 0.0038 +‐ 1.0 5.3 Efficiency of Gromor sulphur bentonite as new fertilizer product of sulphur • Sulphur deficiency is more commonly is corrected though gypsum, SSP or ammonium sulphate. There is no sulphur fertilizer to correct its deficiency. A research net work was therefore initiated to study the efficiency of new source as Gromor sulphur bentonite having 90% S in elemental form. Field studies showed that direct use of S bentonite to improve www.icar.org.in 65 2002‐2007 the grain yield of crops. The effect was significantly superior or at par to SSP and gypsum but better over S control. Among the levels, all the three levels of Bentonite – S significantly increased the yield over S control and response was at par to gypsum and SSP. Highest grain yield was found under the treatment of 40‐60 kg S ha‐1 applied through Bentonite‐S. In case of residual effect of S in maize‐mustard sequence, application of S through different sources increased mustard seed yield over the S control and superior over 20 kg S/ha.
