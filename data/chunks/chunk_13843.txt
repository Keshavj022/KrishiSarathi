 They found biological factors, such as pest and disease outbreaks, most influential, while industrialization and urbanization further influenced cropping patterns. The study stressed a comprehensive approach to address these challenges. Objectives of the Study: This study aims to achieve the following objectives: 1. To understand the historical background of agricultural patterns in India. 2. To analyse the trends in agricultural production in India. 3. To identify the major agricultural crops and production of horticulture crops in India. 4. To draw suitable conclusions from the findings. Methodology: The study is rooted in a theoretical and analytical framework, with data sourced entirely from secondary sources covering the period 1950-51 to 2021-22. A comprehensive review of academic journals, research articles, books, government reports, and prior literature was conducted to gather relevant information. Statistical tools such as tables, ratios, and percentages were employed to systematically organize and interpret the data. Key insights have been presented with detailed explanations accompanying the statistical outputs to ensure clarity and contextual understanding. The methodology aims to provide a robust foundation for analyzing cropping patterns and their implications in India. Data Analysis: The qualitative data and quantitative data have been collected from various secondary sources. The collected data have been analyzed and presented in the following tables and interpretation also given.
