It has also very good chapati and excellent bread- making qualities (Tables 5, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3) Fodder quality : -- i) Reaction to stresses : HD 3086 showed tolerance to terminal heat stress. This is indicated by the performance of the variety under timely, and late and very late sown conditions in yield and other agronomic parameters. It showed high resistant to yellow and brown rust and other diseases 10 Description of parents of the hybrid : A line/Inbred 1 B line/Inbred 2 R line a) Plant height (cm) : Not applicable b) Distinguishing morphological characters : c) Days to flowering : d) Days to maturity (range in number of days â€” : from seed- to- seed) e) Is there any problem of synchronization?
