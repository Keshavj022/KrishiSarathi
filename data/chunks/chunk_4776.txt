 With respect to flowering, the plants under wick system produced harvestable flowers 9.96 days prior to drip system with doubled flower yield of 36.58 flowers per plant per year (i.e. 53.05% > drip system). Earlier flowering and greater flower production were found associated with the enhanced leaf area, number of leaves and better source-sink relationship in wick system as a result of ample moisture, optimal pH and fertilizer retention. Moreover, plants grown on wick system produced flowers with longer stalk (10.54%), thicker neck (16.18%) and extended vase life (5.41%) in comparison to drip system. Prolonged vase life under wick system might be correlated with the sufficient availability of carbohydrates in the flower stalk. Soil parameters Concerning the soil chemical properties, a pH of 7.23 has been noticed under wick system depicting the nearly neutral root environment favourable for crop growth and development. Almost all the essential nutrients are readily available in acidic to neutral pH, hence the lower pH in wick system might have assisted the plant with consistent nutrient uptake. Moreover, the organic carbon (19.53%) and electrical conductivity (0.75 dS/m) were maximum with capillary action system which indicates that the Table 1.

Water-use and economics The amount of water consumed in wick system was 44.68% lesser than drip system and hence it can be stated that the water-use efficiency and water saving were comparatively greater in wick system. Further, the water was supplied to the sub-surface layer thus the water loss due to evaporation was minimal under wick system. While comparing the economics, it was obvious that the net returns were ` 77,231 higher in wick system than drip system despite the higher cultivation cost. Moreover, the benefit cost ratio of wick system was worked to be 1.38 times greater than that of the drip system.
