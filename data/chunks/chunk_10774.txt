 Cowpea: Sowing: Short duration crop, mature in 60-70 days only & highly drought tolerant sown on onset of monsoon. Improved Varieties: There are very limited improved varieties available for its commercial cultivation. 1. RC-19 (Brown seeded) & 2. RC-101 (White seeded) Seed Rate: To get the optimum plant stand 12-15 kg seed per ha is recommended. Moth bean: Sowing: It is also a highly drought tolerant, short duration pulse crop of Kharif season & mostly cultivated in north western arid districts of the Rajasthan state & it prefers sandy soil with good drainage conditions. It also matures in 60-70 days. Sown on onset of monsoon. Improved Varieties: Improved varieties are: RMO-257, RMO-225, RMO-435, RMO-423, RMO-2251, RMB-25, CZM-2. Seed Rate: To get the optimum pant population 10-12 kg seed per ha is sufficient. Cluster bean (Guar): Sowing: It is also a drought tolerant kharif season leguminous crop and cultivated with the onset of monsoon. Improved Varieties: There are two type of varieties in guar crop- (i) Tall and single stem without branching: RGC-197 & RGC-1066, and (ii) Dwarf & branching type: RGC,1017, RGC-1031, RGC-1038, RGC-1055, RGC- 1033, HG-2-20, HG-563 etc. Comparatively dwarf & branching type varieties are short duration & highly drought tolerant than single stem varieties. Seed Rate: Improved varieties seeds of 12-15 kg are sown per ha. Sesame (Til): Sowing: Sowing should be started with the onset of monsoon & must be completed before mid-July. This crop is highly sensitive to water logging conditions; therefore, proper drainage facilities are must for higher productivity. Improved Varieties: The improved varieties are RT-46, RT-125, RT-127, RT-346, RT-351 etc. These varieties mature in about 75-85 days. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 36 Seed Rate: Seed rate of 2-2.5 kg per ha with plant geometry of 45cm x10cm.
