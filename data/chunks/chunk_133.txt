Rajasthan In the budget statement for the financial year 2019- 20, the Honâ€™ble Chief Minister of Rajasthan expressed his support for natural farming through an initiative- Kheti Mein Jaan Toh Sashakt Kisan, which reduced input costs and empowered farmers through profitable farming.

SUMMARY One of the compelling aspects of natural farming is the minimal input costs for farmers, accompanied by no harm to nature or human health. This approach creates a win-win situation. In a world with increasing awareness of the detrimental effects of excessive chemical use, products cultivated through natural means are in high demand, commanding premium prices in the market. Natural farming is gaining popularity due to its emphasis on organic methods, low external inputs, and ecological balance. It offers a potential substitute for traditional farming and can lead to sustainable agriculture and food security. However, to fully realize its potential, several challenges need to be addressed, including access to organic inputs, efficient certification, and beneficial marketing and distribution networks. Collaboration between farmers, governments, educational institutions, and consumers is crucial to tap the potential of natural farming in India. Investments in research, capacity building, and infrastructure development can help facilitate the adoption of natural farming techniques across the country. *Corresponding author email: rajesh.t@icar.gov.in Table 2.
