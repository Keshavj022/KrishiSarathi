in 49 2002‐2007 Response of crops to nutrient with time At several places, under LTFE crops started showing response after few years but in Alfisols response of crop to nutrients was visible from the inception of the experiments. Decline in response of both finger millet and maize with time at Bangalore to N and P and increase in response of crops to K with time was observed (Table 8). The decline in response of crop to P with time is due to N as yield limiting factor. The negative response of finger millet to S and better performance of finger millet on DAP application compared to SSP as source of P indicates that finger millet is not a S loving crop and the little requirement is met through native S.

Whereas, an inclining trends in response of crops to P, K and S with few exceptions were noted, which is due to either exceptionally very good or low yield level during the block of five years. Consistent and sufficiently large response of crops to lime and FYM till date both kharif and rabi seasons at Palampur suggests that both the amendments are essential inputs to sustain the yield in Alfisols.

Unlike Alfisols of Bangalore and Palampur, crop response to S was found to be negative which clearly indicates that S is not liming nutrient at Ranchi and S can be kept away from fertilizer schedule. Since beginning of the experimentation sufficiently larger response of K indicates that K is most growth limiting nutrient.
