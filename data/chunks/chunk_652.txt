Soybean variety SL 982 suitable for western part of Uttar Pradesh Indian Farming 40 July 2023 Economics of new emerging cropping systems Several, new cropping systems are coming up in the different agro- climatic regions after inclusion of high value crops and their high yielding varieties which are disease resistant in the cropping sequences. These alternative improved cropping systems are proven more and more remunerative than existing cropping systems. The yield potential of alternative cropping systems was high across the different agro-climatic zones of the country due to inclusion of new crops and high yield varieties which are most suitable to those climatic conditions, soil and other production factors. The average yield potential of existing cropping systems ranges between 4.1–13.7 t/ha/year but after adopting alternate cropping, the yield potential can be increased in the tune of 5.0–30.1 t/ha/year. The mean data of different existing cropping systems across the country showed that the yield potential ranges between 9.19 t/ha/ year but after adoption of attenuate cropping systems in different locations the yield potential can be increased in the tune of 16.85 t/ha/ year and economic advantage of existing systems stand at `183800/ ha/year and it can be increased by `338000/ha/year. The percentage increase in yield of alternate cropping systems was `154200/ha/ year after adoption of new crops in place of traditional crops in that area. It is a non-monetary input for crop production, simple farmers have to be awared about the new crops and their varieties which are suitable to their area. SUMMARY The current cropping systems in the country do not give the guarantee to be productive and profitable in the future to come.
