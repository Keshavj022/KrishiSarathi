 Suitability of derelict paddy fields and inland saline waters for brackishwater aquaculture: Area of derelict paddy fields identified using remote sensing was about 559 ha in Thrissur and 940 ha in Ernakulam districts of Kerala. Based on the water and soil characteristics of these abandoned paddy fields and nearby brackishwater sources, about 117 ha (21%) and 179 ha (19%) were found to be suitable for an extensive culture of shrimp or polyculture of shrimp and finfishes in Thrissur and Ernakulam districts, respectively. Inland saline waters of Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh, on analysis showed an excess of magnesium and calcium, due to which these had higher hardness compared to that of coastal waters of similar salinity. The calcium concentration was comparatively very high affecting the Mg/Ca (0.30-2.75) and Ca/K ratios State Cropping system Yield Net income ( /ha) Soil organic carbon (%) Gujarat Greengram–coriander–vegetable cowpea (groundnut- equivalent yield) 4,717 1,10562 0.33 Greengram-fennel-fallow (groundnut equivalent yield) 2,332 24,634 0.32 Rajasthan Sweet-corn + blackgram–chickpea (maize-equivalent yield) 7,959 82,989 0.67 Soybean-fenugreek (maize-equivalent yield) 4,955 66,703 0.74 Uttarakhand Finger millet + black soybean (2:1) – wheat + toria (2:1) (finger millet-equivalent yield) 2,787 47,840 0.95 Greengram and fennel under organic production system (SK Nagar, Gujarat) Soil and Water Productivity icar annual report 2022-23 125 (0.45-125.53), which signifies the supplementation of Mg and K minerals. These inland saline waters are not suitable for agriculture (>5 ppt) and can be utilized for brackishwater aquaculture. Geo-spatial mapping of deep pools in Godavari basin to monitor riverine connectivity: Rivers are dynamic ecosystems with diverse habitats that require adequate connectivity to sustain the fish genetic resources, an important component of aquatic ecosystem services. Geo-spatial mapping offer powerful tool for assessing river connectivity. The Sentinel-2 datasets (2016-21) were used in five different eco-regions, viz. Wainganga, Wardha, Pranhita, Godavari-mid and Manair in Godavari Basin in the Indian Deccan Plateau. The analysis revealed contiguous water flow in Pranhita and a section of Wainganga though the flow was feeble. The river Pranhita with deep pools and copious perennial habitats act as a repository for endemic aquatic biota in the Godavari basin as well as Indian Deccan Plateau. The obstructed flow and large-sized patches reported in river Wardha enable formation of refugia for fish species during summer months. The river continuity assessment and mapping of deep pools will be a step towards ecosystem-based conservation of fisheries resources.
