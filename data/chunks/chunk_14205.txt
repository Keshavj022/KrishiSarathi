56 for SPEI, Fig. 11f). The relatively higher median value supports the notion that SSMI could serve as a better indicator of drought compared to ESSMI. 4.3. Drought area analysis The Drought Area Ratio (DAR) is measured for the four drought classes (near normal and mild drought, moderate drought, severe drought, and extreme drought) and indices across the study area and total study period from 1991 to 2020. The DAR is computed as the number of grids of a specific drought class to the total number of grids present in the study area. The DAR exclusively reflects the prevalent dry conditions by taking into account the indices’ values that signify a specific drought class. Observations from Fig. 12 indicate that most of the study area is covered by near normal and mild droughts and the percentages of area affected by this class are as follows: 72.07 % (SSMI); 82.87 % (ESSMI); 76.91 % (SPI) and 68.29 % (SPEI). Then the moderate and severe droughts are covering the second and third highest areas of the study area as 12.61 % (SSMI), 14.92 % (ESSMI), 9.28 % (SPI) and 14.67 % (SPEI); and 5.33 % (SSMI), 2.04 % (ESSMI), 4.19 % (SPI) and 8.87 % (SPEI) respectively. Lastly, it has been observed that the extreme drought has covered the least percentages of the total study area i.e. 9.9 % (SSMI), 9.62 (SPI) and 8.16 % (SPEI), whereas ESSMI captured only 0.17 % of the total area as extreme drought affected. This suggests that ESSMI struggles to accurately identify extreme droughts. The ESSMI’s limitations can be attributed to its non-parametric empirical approach, unlike the parametric approaches used by SSMI, SPI, and SPEI. This pattern, where parametric methods performing better than non- parametric methods in capturing extreme droughts is observed in other studies. For example, Sol´akov´a et al. (2014) compared parametric and non-parametric methods for calculating the SPI and Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI), finding that parametric methods were superior in capturing extreme values. Tijdeman et al. (2020) analysed below- Fig. 10. Spatial distributions of the drought indices across SPH i.e. SSMI, ESSMI, SPI and SPEI for the wettest month and season of the wettest year of 2020 along with the annual distribution. Fig. 11.

They used multiple parametric and non-parametric methods of the SSI and found that non-parametric methods under- estimated the spread in minimum SSI values. Similarly, Noguera et al.
