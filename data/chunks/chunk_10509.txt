 Two processing varieties of potato developed using CIP accessions as male parents occupy over 100,000 ha area in India. These varieties fetch 20-25% higher price in wholesale over HYVs. Besides, training to the scientists on innovative technologies like aeroponic for seed production, marker assisted selection, GIS, crop modeling, TPS production technology, etc were provided at CIP, Lima. Indian Agriculture after Independence 368 ILRI implemented collaborative projects in the region including Cereal System Initiative South Asia (CSISA), Enhancing livelihoods through livestock knowledge systems (ELKS), Milk India Tanzania (MilkIT) Project, Farm Animal Genetics Resources (FAnGR), India Mozambique Goat (IMGoat) project, Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), etc. Presently ILRI-ICAR collaboration is driving research on assessment of economic impact of priority animal diseases and their control; genome wide association study in indigenous poultry breeds/varieties; methane emission and its mitigation and multi-dimensional improvement of food-feed crops including deconstructing ligno- cellulose biomass. The research priorities of ICAR-WorldFish collaborations have helped environment foot print analysis of carp and pangasius farming systems in India and yield gap analysis and on farm performance evaluation of genetically improved varieties e.g., Jayanti rohu and freshwater prawn; productivity enhancement from wetlands and flood plains and development of specific fish products for the pregnant women and children of 6-24 months age.
