, 2015; Zhao et al., 2015; Patra et al., 2019a). The SOC and TN storages were represented cumulatively at soil depths of 0–5, 0–10, 0–15, 0–20, 0–25, and 0–30 cm. The ESM of SOC and TN were calculated using Eq. (3): MESM = [ ∑ n i=1 Msoil,i × conci + ( Mk − ∑ n i=1 Msoil,i ) × concextra ] × 0.001 (3) where MESM (Mg ha−1) is the ESM of SOC and TN storage; Msoil, i (Mg ha−1) is the soil mass of ith soil layer, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, representing 0–5, > 5–10, > 10–15, > 15–20, > 20–25 and > 25–30 cm soil layers, respectively; conci (g kg−1) is the concentration of SOC and TN in the ith soil layer; Mk is the certain soil mass, and when k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, it indicates the maximal soil mass following various management prac­ tices in the 0–5, 5–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–25, 25–30 cm soil depths; concextra (g kg−1) is the extra SOC and TN concentration, and when i = 6, the concextra was considered to be equal to the bottom soil depth because SOC and TN altered less in greater depth; 0.001 is a conversion factor (Mg kg−1). M soil, i (Mg ha−1) was computed based on Eq. (4). Msoil,i = ρb,i × Xi × 10000 (4) where ρb,i (Mg m−3) is the fine soil (< 2 mm) bulk density and Xi (m) is the soil thickness; 10,000 is a unit conversion factor (m2 ha−1). 2.4.4. Carbon pool index (CPI) The CPI was computed as follows (Blair et al., 1995; de Oliveira Ferreira et al., 2013). CPI = TOCS TOCR (5) where TOCS = Total SOC content in sample treatment (Mg ha−1) and TOCR = Total SOC content in reference treatment (Sal forest) (Mg ha−1). 2.5. Statistical analysis Three samples from each treatment were obtained as three replica­ tions from depths 0–5, 5–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–25, and 25–30 cm. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed separately for testing the significance among the means of bulk densities, concentration, storage, and SR of SOM parameters (SOC and TN) for the same soil depth and for testing the significance of means among different depths for same treatment (Patra et al., 2019a). The Shapiro-Wilk test (Shapiro and Wilk, 1965) was used to evaluate the normality of the treatment data, and transformation was performed in order to normalize data in case of non- normal data. A parametric test (Least Significant Difference test) S.K. Kar et al. Geoderma Regional 32 (2023) e00616 5 (Webster, 2007) was used to make multiple comparisons among means. A nonparametric (Kruskal–Wallis) test was used to determine if there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) among the means of parameters that were not normally distributed even after appropriate trans­ formation (Zhang et al., 2021). The SPSS software (version 21) was used to conduct all statistical analyses. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Soil physicochemical properties The variation of soil bulk densities (ρb) as influenced by various land use practices and due to increment of soil depth is presented in Fig. 2. Under all treatments, the ρb increased with increasing soil depth. The ρb varied from 1.00 ± 0.
