 A tractor-drawn weeding machine for soybean rotary weeder, an intercrop seed- drill and a conservation seed-drill for soybean have been developed. To facilitate spreading of organic manure uniformly in shorter time with efficiency, hydraulic ● Soybean MAUS 61 with moderate resistance to soybean rust has been identified for southern Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and other parts of peninsular India. ● Hardee and Punjab 1 soybean showed lowest level of trypsin inhibitor. This trait will enhance food uses of soybean ● A tractor-drawn weeding machine for soybean rotary weeder, an intercrop seed-drill and a conservation seed-drill for soybean have been developed. Rotary weeder (power weeder) tractor drawn for soybean Intercrop seed-drill for soybean CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 29 trolley has been provided with a detachable attachment. This attachment facilitates uniform spread of manure. In a day of 8 hours, the machine can spread manure in 4- 5 hectares. Food uses of soybean have been promoted through training and demonstrations. Crop Protection Bio-pesticide Beauveria bassiana formulation at 1 litre/ha before or after the spray of Triazophos (0.05%) has been highly effective in controlling major insect- pests. Bt formulation (Dipel) has been found compatible with Monocrotophos, Topsin- M, Bayleton and Bavistin and also with a mixture of Monocrotophos and Topsin- M, Bayleton/Bavistin. However, mixture of Monocrotophos and Bayleton had synergistic effect, suppressing growth of Bt. Seed treatment with Thiomethoxam 70 WS at 3 g/kg of seed, Carbosulfan 25 DS at 30g/kg of seed and soil application with Phorate 10 G (at 10kg/ha) and Carbofuran 3G at 30 kg/ha were highly effective in controlling damage (stem tunnelling) by stem-fly maggots. Two sprays of Carbendazim or Thiophanate Methyl at 0.05%, at 35 and 50 DAS were effective and economical for management of Myrothecium, Alternaria and Cercospora foliar diseases. SUNFLOWER Sunflower accessions DSI 34, DSI 91, DSI 107, Acc 1505, Acc 1485, Acc 179, DCMS 6, DCMS 14, CMS 335A, TUB 346, M 92-4 are found superior for agronomic and physiological performances. And 664, 1254, 1149, 1426, 138, 73 and 69 have been found highly tolerant to Alternaria blight; with less than 5% disease incidence. The accession 866 was free from thrips and 1148, 1139-1, 1439 and EC 399459 had very low population (<1/plant). EC 399514, EC 376211 and EC 399459 are found promising against leaf hopper. White-fly population was nil in EC 399514 and in 864, 1254, 1149, 1464, 916-1, EC 399459, EC 399418, Acc 1142 and Acc 221, there was less than one white-fly/plant. Stable CMS lines with arg cytoplasm and nuclear genome of Morden have been isolated and their isogenic fertile counterparts have been identified.
