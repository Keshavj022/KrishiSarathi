 Use of bio-fertilizers (Rhizobium seed treatment and PSB 500 g / ha). Pre-emergence herbicide application of Pendimethalin 30 EC (3.25 lit/ha). Grow sunflower seeds as live bird perches Spray 2% urea during initial stage of flowering. After the crop attains 35 to 40 days, nipping practice is recommended to increase the yield. Spraying of pulse magic (5gm/L of water) for more pods and pod weight at flowering stage. Use of traps & lures (10 Nos./acre) for the management of pod borer menace. Growing of coriander (6:1) as trap crop for the management of pod borer is recommended. Use chemical spinosad 0.25 ml/L of water for control pod borer. Sorghum: Seeds to be treated with Calcium Chloride to get uniform emergence of seedlings and to induce drought tolerance. Soil application of Trichoderma enriched FYM @ 1kg/ 100 kg FYM before sowing Spray Potassium Nitrate (KNO3) at 5 gm per lit of water after 30 and 60 days after sowing for increase the drought resistant for higher yield. Wheat: Pre-emergence herbicide application of Pendimethalin 30 EC (3.25 lit/ha). After 30 days after sowing post emergence application of 20 gm Metsulfuron methyl 20 WDG. At the time of sowing, soil application of Zinc Sulphate and Ferrous Sulphate (8 kg/ac) mixed with 16 kg vermicompost after 10 days shade dry and spray Zinc Sulphate @ 5 gm/lit at tasseling stage of the crops. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 400 Sunflower: Sowing of border crop with jowar/bajra (5-7 rows), use of new hybrids RSFH -1887, KBSH-42, KBSH-44 seeds @ 5 kg / ha, Seed priming with CaCl2 (2%) for 6 hours. Apply 36:36:25 kg NPK/ac @ ZnSo4 4 kg, Borax 6 kg + FYM 3 tonnes/ac. Spray of Boron @ 0.5% at the time of flowering and follow hand pollination, honeybee keeping and sprinkling of sesamum seeds for better seed set. Powdery disease can be controlled by spraying myclobutanil 0.5 gram or difenconzole 1 ml or hexaconoazole 1 ml per one litre water spray. Ground nut: Seed treatment with bio-fertilizers (Rhizobium and PSB 500 g / ha). Application of Gypsum (200 kg/ac) at the time of sowing and seed is treated with SAAF at 2 gm/kg of the seed to prevent any infestation from soil borne diseases. Chlorpyriphos is used @ 10 ml/kg of seed to prevent the seed damage from soil insects at initial stages. Pre-emergence herbicide application of Pendimethalin 30 EC (3.25 lit/ha) for initial weed management. Cotton: Bt. Cotton seeds@450gms per acre, seed treatment with Zinc Sulphate, Ferrous Sulphate, Magnesium sulphate and Manganese sulphate (4 gm/kg of seed) may be followed. Yellow sticky traps @10 per acre, Spray of systemic insecticides (need based) For management of leaf reddening, spray Magnesium sulphate (1%) with 1 per cent 19:19:19 (water soluble) fertilizer at 100-110 days after sowing. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 401 Alternative furrow irrigation in drought condition may be adopted. For cotton alternaria leaf spot and leaf blight spray Mancozeb 2 g/ lit.
