 Real-time decision-making benefits from edge computing, reducing latency in critical applications like autonomous vehicles. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and voice recognition enhance human-machine interactions, particularly in smart homes. The collaboration of Al and loT finds applications in healthcare for remote monitoring and predictive analytics, smart agriculture for precision farming, and energy management for optimizing consumption. This synergy extends to smart cities, where Al-powered loT devices contribute to traffic management and public services. Overall, the convergence of Al and loT holds tremendous potential, ushering in a new era of intelligent, adaptive, and efficient systems. 3.2. Machine Learning (ML) Machine learning is essentially the scientific approach enabling machines to interpret, process, and analyze data for addressing real-world issues. It is simply a subset of Artificial Intelligence (Al) that imparts machines with the capacity to autonomously learn and enhance their performance through experience, without explicit programming. In essence, machine learning involves empowering machines to think and solve problem. This discipline relies on vast amounts of both structured and unstructured data, ensuring that machine learning models deliver accurate results or predictions based on the acquired knowledge. Application of machine learning in agriculture allows more efficient and precise farming with less human manpower with high quality production. Machine learning is categorized into four types, namely: a. Supervised Learning: A supervised learning algorithm gains knowledge from labelled training data, enabling it to make predictions for new, unseen data. For instance, supervised learning can be employed to predict crop yield or disease and pest detection based on training data. In this scenario, the input variables may include factors such as the geographic location, weather patterns, soil quality etc. locality and size of a house.

Semi-supervised learning: Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm that lies between supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In this approach, the model is trained on a dataset that contains both labelled and unlabelled examples. In semi-supervised learning, a portion of the training data is labelled, and the rest is unlabelled. The model is trained on both the labelled and unlabelled data to learn patterns and relationships. This can be especially useful when obtaining labelled data is expensive or time-consuming, as it allows the model to leverage the available labelled examples along with the potentially larger pool of unlabelled data.
