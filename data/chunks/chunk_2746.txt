 Was the BN used different from F 414? Not aware ofcharacteristics ofF 414. 6. Was there any variability in morphological traits of the BN used for transformation? At the time of transformation studies, morpbological traits were not ascertained. However, available BN seeds possess variations for pollen colour. 7. When, where and how the different generations ofBN Bt were raised? & 8. What was the approximate area, number of plants I progenies grown and selected in different generations in your experiment during different years? Generation wise seed mnltiplication in BNBt Year Gene- Population size ration 2001-02 To 79 plants in transgenic green house. 2002-03 T. Twelve progenies were grown in 84 rows each with different numbers of rows depending on availability of seeds. Each row was 6 m length. There was no germination for one progeny. 2003-04 T2 Only eleven progenies were continued, each with 25 rows. 2004-05 T3 917 plants of AT1 8-10 based on single copy introgression of southern analysis were sown in open field under isolation. Seeds ofBt positive plants were used for RCGM trial during 2005-06. 2005-06 T4 78 plants selected as homozygous based on Bt strip test were sown each aboutl5 rows under isolation in an open field. Seeds of Bt positive plants based on Bt strip test were used for RCGM trial in 2006-07. 2006-07 Ts Progenies of 25 homozygous (Based on Bangalore Genie report) plants were raised in open field under isolation. 2007-08 T6 Progenies of25 plants were raised in open field under isolation. 2008-09 T7 Bulk seeds ofhomozygous plants were used in seed production at different farms ofUAS, Dharwad under isolation. 2009-10 Ts Bulk seeds were grown at ARS, Dharwad 9. During the development of BN Bt, was there any trial at that Agric. Research Station havingBt cotton carrying 'MON 53I' event? From 2002-03 itself tbe Bt cotton with Mon S31testing trials were taken up at ARS, Dharwad regularly. 10.
