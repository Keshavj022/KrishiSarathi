 G Byju*1 and D Jaganathan2 T HE Northeastern (NE) states consist of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura have a rich diversity of tropical root and tuber crops and have tremendous potential for cultivation of these crops by diverse agroclimatic conditions, varied soil and high rainfall with wide regional variation. Cassava, taro and yams are predominantly grown in the shifting (jhum) cultivation. Sweet potato and taro are grown considerably not only in the hills but also in the plains of Assam and Tripura. In yams, both Dioscorea alata and D. esculenta are grown mostly in the backyards and the tubers are even collected from the forest. Similarly, different types of taro, tannia and elephant foot yam are found to grow both in forest areas and in kitchen gardens. Most of the tuber crops like sweet potato, taro, cassava and yams are grown as mixed crops with ginger, chilli, brinjal, beans, etc. In a few regions, sweet potato and taro are also grown as pure crops. The tropical tubers are a reservoir of dietary energy (86-300 kcal/100g), micronutrients (Fe 0.2-3 mg/100g, Zn 0.3-2mg/100g), vitamins (Vit. E 0.2-2mg/100g), antioxidants (β-carotene and anthocyanin) and dietary fibres. Most of these crops are sources of functional foods due to low glycemic index (44-54), slow digestible and resistant starch. The nutritional profile of tropical tuber crops is given in Table 1. Importance of tuber crops in Northeast region Tropical tuber crops play a crucial role in the food and nutritional security of the tribals and animal feed in the NE region of India. Bestowed with capacities of high productivity and climate resilience, tuber crops cater to food and nutritional requirements during off-season and also during disasters. Cassava is a major crop in Meghalaya and Nagaland, while sweet potato is grown extensively in Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland. Yams are found mostly in Nagaland while taro and elephant Table 1.
