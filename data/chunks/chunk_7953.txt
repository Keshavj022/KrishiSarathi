Mapping of genomic region responsible for salinity tolerance at germination stage using DHs of Savitri × Pokkali of rice: Identified four candidate genes [LOC_Os01g09550 (no apical meristem protein), LOC_Os01g09560 (mitochondrial-processing peptidase subunit alpha), LOC_Os12g06560 (putative protein) and LOC_Os12g06570 (cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel)] using 117 DH lines derived from Savitri × Pokkali for salinity tolerance at germination stage. Haplotype of recessive opaque2 in QPM inbreds: A set of 46 QPM inbreds of exotic and indigenous origin were genotyped using opaque2 (o2) gen-based two SSRs, viz. umc1066 and phi057, present on exon- 1 and exon-6 of the gene, respectively. Among the haplotypes, o2-AE had the highest frequency (76.09%), followed by o2-AD (15.22%) and o2-BD (4.35%). o2-BC and o2-AC haplotypes were observed in 2.17% each of the inbreds. Haplotype, o2-BE was not found in the inbred panel. Inbreds from IARI, New Delhi had o2-AE and o2-AD haplotypes. So far, breeders perceived that only one recessive o2 allele exist in the population, the present study reports here the occurrence of at least five versions of recessive o2 allele. Discovery of salinity responsive long non-coding RNAs of rice at reproductive stages Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as important regulatory molecules of eukaryotic gene expression in every domain of life.
