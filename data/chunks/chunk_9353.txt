 79 Khadin system of runoff farming: Khadin is a low lying area surrounded by an upland catchment and best considered as a runoff farming system in the arid region receiving <300 mm annual rainfall. This is a locally developed and adopted technology where crops can be grown using the conserved moisture. Rainwater that falls on surrounding rocky /gravelly catchments travels through a natural surface drainage system and accumulates in low-lying areas where a topographical barrier or a constructed bund is encountered. These bunds are called khadin bunds, and the transported soils alleviate in the area of water accumulation. With passage of time, the entire alleviated soils form a khadin. At the approach of winter season when water recedes, people cultivate rabi crops like wheat, mustard and gram on such conserved moisture in the khadins (Fig. 2a and b). Traditionally, khadin system was designed and developed by the Paliwal Brahmins of Jaisalmer (Rajasthan) in 15th century. Central Arid Zone Research Instutute (CAZRI), Jodhpur played an important role in an improved version of khadin for western region of the Indian Thar Desert. More than 500 khadins exist in this region. Fig. 1.

The ratio between cultivated and catchment areas varies from 1:15 to 1:56. The water holding capacity and water infiltration, rates are balanced by the shallow depth of soils in the beds. The basement of khadin is invariably a hard surface upon which sand-silt-clay tend to accumulate up to few meters depth. This maintains a convenient supply of natural moisture and nutrients within the crop’s root zone. Few wells are generally kept on down side of earthen bund; they are recharged from water in khadin and the water is used during summer months when khadin bed dries. Khadin soils are more fertile compared to other desert soils. The organic carbon content in surface and sub-surface soils varies from Agro-biodiversity, Ecology and Agriculture: Gandhian Thoughts 80 Mahatma Gandhi’s Vision of Agriculture: Achievements of ICAR 0.39 to 0.76% and from 0.12 to 0.40%, respectively. The available P2O5 and K in the soil varied from 26-120 and 300-1000 kg ha-1, respectively. The total nitrogen content in different khadin ranges between 0.018 to 0.035% and pH of the surface is usually below 8.5. The water holding capacity of khadin soils range from 200 to 250 mm per meter depth. ICAR - CAZRI has also contributed for constructing improved khadin in different parts of western Rajasthan. One such khadin at Danta in Barmer district has a catchment area of 137 ha with 6.88 ha under submergence. The total water storage capacity of khadin is 54.
