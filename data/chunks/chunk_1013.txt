Urea treatment: Treating crop residues with 5–10% urea and 25–50% moisture improves their nutritive value by increasing digestibility, palatability and crude protein content. If the stover is wet with rain or with freshly harvested stover containing much green material, urea can be applied without prior adding extra moisture. Treated stover is best kept in airtight condition. The outer (untreated) parts can be fed to animals with lower requirements, such as draught bullocks or dry cows, while the inner part is fed to growing and lactating animals. Treatment time may vary from 1–4 weeks. Temperature and treatment time are inversely correlated and more time is required in winter or in colder climates.
