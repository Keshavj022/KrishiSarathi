109’ – which has red skin and is an early maturing variety (70-day maturity after planting) selected and yielding 40.91 Fig. 15. CIP clone 397006.18 reccomended for release in 2019 Fig. 16. CIP clone 397006.18 reccomended for release in 2019 ICAR-CGIAR | ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 54 t/ha (marketable) and 43.02 t/ha (total) showed superiority by margin of 11% over best control other red variety (Fig. 16). This clone possessed 20% tuber dry matter and exhibited excellent keeping quality. The clone is resistance to viruses and moderately tolerant to late blight. Farmers and consumers both like red skin potatoes in Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, North Eastern States and Jammu & Kashmir. There is great demand from the listed States to have new red skin variety as the exiting varieties exhibit poor yield trait. Earlier planting gives farmers the ability to sell their potatoes at a premium price. Early harvests give time to farmers to plant an additional winter crop to enhance their income. Release of this variety will enhance 30-40 productivity of North Eastern States and is expected to improve farmers’ income by over 40%. In 2019, CIP introduced a low cost apical rooted cutting technology to produce mini tubers as an alternative to highly capital intensive aeroponics (Fig. 17). This is now widely adopted in Vietnam and Africa. We have worked closely with CPRI to conduct economic viability of this technology in CPRI’s Shillong center. In addition, we have set up two facilities that include tissue culture, poly house and net house to product mini tubers from tissue culture plantlets. The cost of one mini tuber would be about one rupee in apical rooted cuttings as compared to 6-8 rupees in aeroponics. Potato Technology Center in Haryana has also adopted this technology to produce mini tubers of Kufri Lima and other popular varieties. In addition, CIP introduced low cost temporary net house technology in West Bengal, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Assam to initiate sustainable quality seed production. Production of healthy locally produced seed will reduce 40% seed cost and enhance farmer’s income by 50% through enhanced yield compared to seed imported from other states. Three farmer clubs in North Bengal were selected for testing and upscaling the low-cost net house technologies at farm-level. Quality seeds were produced at three location in six temporary net houses of each 1350 m2 Total cost of cultivation for 6 units was Rs. 3,60,000, gross sale was Rs. 13,95,000 and average profit per unit of 1350 m2 was Rs. 1,72,500. ATMA and Pradhanmantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna is upscaling this technology in North Bengal by supporting farmer’s clubs in making more net houses (Fig. 18). The SFLF model is a participatory and innovative bottoms up informal model where the farmers organize themselves into groups and synchronize their operations by virtually converting their small landholdings into a large field.
