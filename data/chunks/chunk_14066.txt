 (6) Rainfall variability. We used the coefﬁcient of variation of rainfall during the preceding decades (1991–2020) to estimate rainfall variability, which is assumed to have a negative effect on agricultural sustainability. Climate change, manifesting as short-term variability of weather variables, exacerbates the threat of food insecurity among many farming communities (Singh, 2020a). The negative consequences of rainfall variability on agriculture include reduced productivity, increased incidence of crop disease, and S.S. Jatav and K. Naik Regional Sustainability 4 (2023) 218–234 222 drastic reduction in soil fertility (Gadgil and Gadgil, 2006). According to Kavi Kumar and Viswanathan (2015), the monsoon variation, particularly those resulting in severe drought, caused approximately 2.00%–5.00% reduction of Indian GDP. (7) Minimum temperature variability and maximum temperature variability. Anthropogenic induced climate change has been realized all over the world and has resulted in the increase of global surface temperature by 0.85 C over the past 100 years. According to the report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2014), the global surface temperature is predicted to increase further by at least 1.50 C by the end of the 21st century. Poverty and disadvantage have increased with recent warming and are expected to increase as average global temperature increase from 1.00 C to 1.50 C and higher (IPCC, 2018). In this study, we estimated the variability of minimum and maximum temperatures by the coefﬁcient of temperature variation during 1991–2020, and hypothesized that both of the indicators have negative effects on agricultural sustainability. (8) Cropping intensity. High cropping intensity promotes integrated farming and better resource usage and imparts resilience. It also contributes to nutrient recycling and climate regulation, and is considered to have a positive effect on environment (Cassman, 1999). Further, it avoids the necessity for clearing the forest lands. Cropping intensity increases consistently at the national level, and it was 139.35% in 2019. (9) Farmers' perception on natural calamities. Analysis of farmer’s perception on climate change is a prerequisite for assessing adaptation and achieving agricultural sustainability. The literature on climate change perception has clearly identiﬁed the important of timing and types of climate change instances that farmers usually observe and utilize to frame their perceptions (Singh, 2020a, 2020c). Weather extremes are uncertain, so farmers need to act instantaneously to avoid losses. Decision making by farmers under such circumstances is quite difﬁcult (Jatav and Singh, 2023), as the time lag between gathering and processing information and decision-making is quite short (Jatav, 2022). The results show that about 64.63% of Indian farmers perceived that natural calamities destroy crops in 2019. 2.1.2.
