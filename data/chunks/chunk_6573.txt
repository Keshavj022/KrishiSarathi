5%, respectively over uninoculated control (15.50 q/ha). Crop pollination through Apis and non-Apis bee pollinators in cucurbitaceous crops: The pollination efficiency and yield advantage studies were conducted in various cucurbitaceous crops. In snake gourd (Trichosanthes tricuspidata), the interaction between Indian bee (Apis cerana indica) and Bumble bee (Bombus haemorrhodalis) recorded 32.70% increase in seed yield and 43.60% increase in fruit yield. In round gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), the interaction between Ceratina sp. and B. haemorrhodalis recorded 54.69% and 48.50% increase in seed and fruit yield, respectively. Further in bitter gourd (Momordica charantia), Ceratina sp. and Indian bee in interaction recorded 106.70% and 73.55% increase in seed and fruit yield. Moreover, in ridge gourd (Luffa acutangula), Apis cerana indica and B. haemorrhodalis showed 39.74% and 66.75% increase in seed and fruit yield. However, in case of pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata), B. haemorrhodalis alone recorded 94.38% and 83.50% increase in seed and fruit yield respectively. It may be concluded that the wild insect pollinators play a significant role in yield enhancement in cucurbits along with their domesticated counterparts. Agricultural information network usage among hill farmers of north eastern Himalayan regions: The study aimed to delineate and analyse the configuration of information networks of farmers with respect to the acquisition of information in north eastern hill regions covering 320 vegetable growers. Social network analysis was used to reveal the important sources as well as patterns of information access by farmers. For male farmers, Block Agriculture Officer/ATMA had the highest degree centrality, followed by shopkeeper/ input dealer and State horticulture department. For female farmers, shopkeeper/input dealer had the State varieties released and notified Crop Variety Area of adoption Salient features Lentil VL Masoor 150 Uttarakhand (Organic conditions) • Maturity: 155–160 days. • Small seeded for timely sown rainfed organic condition of Uttarakhand hills; average yield 8.41 q/ha). • Moderately resistant against wilt, rust, pod damage and aphids.
