 Aphid and thrips: Installation of yellow and blue sticky traps @ 10-12 trap/ha each followed by foliar spray with neem oil 3000 ppm @4ml/lit. water or NSKE 5% or Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 0.3ml/lit. or acephate 75 SP @ 1.5 ml/lit. water Seed midge: foliar spray with neem oil 3000 ppm @4ml/lit. water or NSKE 5% or methyl-O-demeton 25 EC @ 1ml/lit. water Powdery mildew: Dusting with Sulphur dust @ 20-25 kg/ha in morning hours is recommended followed by foliar spray with Kerathan (Dinocap) @ 1ml/lit. water at 10-15 days’ interval, harvesting of the mature crop should not be delayed avoiding powdery mildew attack. Blight: cloudy weather and high humidity at flowering stage is favourable for this disease, advised to foliar spray with fungicide propiconazole or hexaconazole 5% SC @ 1ml/lit. water at 15 days’ interval. Wilt: Follow seed treatment and soil treatment with Trichoderma or Bavstin before sowing as suggested above Gummosis disease: Use healthy seeds for sowing, seeds should be treatment and crop rotation should be followed to minimize this problem Root and stem rot disease: stem and root rotting is a common symptom of this disease, small and big size sclerotia seen on the roots. Disease can be controlled by seed treatment with carbendazim or bavstin @ 2g or Trichoderma @ 10 g/kg seed and crop rotation of 3 years. Frost management: this crop is very sensitive to frost, during the chances of frosting apply light irrigation and foliar spray with sulfuric acid 0.1% at midnight to escape crop form the frost. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 102 Storage: Moisture level of seeds should be maintained below 8.5-9 per cent for long storage Vegetable crops cultivation Sowing and cultivation of vegetable Pea/ Beetroot/ Brinjal/ Cabbage/ Cauliflower (Mid and late)/ Carrot/ Potato/ Palak/ Onion/ Radish/ Tomato/ Fenugreek/ Coriender/ Green onion/ Garlic/ Mustard leaves in September-October month. Sowing the seed after seed treatment with improved method for good germination and reduce time and cost of cultivation. Adopt crop rotation, select healthy and resistant varieties, deep ploughing of field can reduce the major leaf curl virus problem in chilli, Brinjal, Tomato and Potato. Manage Termite in soil-by-soil solarisation, summer ploughing and application of chloropyriphos powder @ 25 kg/ha and pest like fruit borer, stem borer, caterpillar, leaf minor, fruit fly etc. can be managed by regular spray of neem oil and other broad-spectrum insecticides. Transplanting of Mid and late cauliflower and cabbage/Tomato/ Chilli/ Brinjal/ Onion vegetables in the month of October- November. Recommended varieties of various vegetable crops: Tomato: Arka Rakshak, Hisar Lalit, Pusa Ruby, Pusa-120, Best of all, Pusa Gaurav. Farmers are advised to adopt Triple resistant (resistant to leaf curl virus, bacterial blight, and early blight diseases) tomato variety ‘Arka Rakshak’ developed by IIHR, Bangalore to get more production.
