 cerasiforme) is one of the valuable cash crops of Sikkim. It is grown in almost every household in different cropping system, i.e. homestead cultivation, mono-cultivation and mixed cropping, etc. This chilli contains capsaicin which produces different pungency levels as well as carotenoids and phenolic compounds and is being used as natural pigment and antioxidant agents. However, the Scoville scale indicates that its pungency is very high and is in the range of 1,00,000–3,50,000. Fruit yield ranges from 80–150 q/ha with an average productivity of 120 q/ha. The average net return of ₹10,25,000/ha results in very high benefit:cost (B:C) ratio of 6.8. Production efficiency and economic efficiency of red cherry pepper are recorded as 63.15 kg/ha/day and ₹5,394.7/ha/day respectively. Red cherry pepper is selected as one district one crop for Gangtok district of Sikkim. Micronutrient management in cauliflower and tomato in acidic soils in Meghalaya: Field experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of graded micronutrient doses, viz. zinc sulphate (zinc-21%), borax (boron-10.5%) and ammonium molybdate (52%) on the yield and quality of cauliflower (cv. Seminis Megha) and tomato (Arka Abhed) in Meghalaya condition. Results revealed that the cauliflower productivity increased substantially, i.e. up to 64% over control by the application of zinc sulphate (@15 kg/ha), borax (@15 kg/ha), and ammonium molybdate (@2.0 kg/ha) and two foliar applications of micronutrients, viz. zinc sulphate @0.25%, borax @0.10%, and ammonium molybdate @0.10% at 15–20 days-intervals beginning at 30 days after sowing (DAS). In tomato, soil application of zinc sulphate and borax @5 kg/ha + ammonium molybdate @0.5 kg/ha along with 3 foliar applications (zinc sulphate and borax each @0.25% and ammonium molybdate @0.10%) at 15 days-interval starting from 30 days after transplanting (DAT) significantly increased the yield of tomato by 36.8% in Meghalaya condition. Foliar application of micronutrients increased the ascorbic acid content, whereas soil alone or soil + foliar application reduced its overall ascorbic acid content. Soil application along with 3 times foliar application of micronutrients found to be effective in increasing tomato productivity in the NEH region. Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) Technology Demonstrations Maize FLDs in Kashmir: FLDs of maize hybrids VLQPMH 59 were conducted in Kashmir in 3 ha (72 nos.) in collaboration with Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, Kashmir (SKUAST-K). FLDs were conducted in district Anantnag and Kupwara. The yield of VLQPMH 59 ranged from 50.0–62.0 q (average 55.0 q) and gain over the local cultivar ranged from 28.2–87.5% (average 56.0%). The yield of local cultivar ranged from 31.0–39.0 q (average 35.4 q). For demonstration in the newly adopted tribal clusters, a total of 80.0 q seed of newly developed and popular wheat varieties from the institute i.e.
