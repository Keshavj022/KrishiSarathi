 Equipped with knowledge and skills in poultry production techniques such as vaccination, weighing, cleaning, and feeding, he initiated a commercial poultry farming operation in 2022 with 1,800 chicks, all under the expert guidance of KVK Scientists. Initially he received support from KVK, Banswara, in the form of 100 Kadaknath chicks (6 weeks old), a cage, a feeder, and a water drinker. The progress of his poultry venture was regularly monitored by KVK Scientists. As a result of his hard work and dedication, Mr. Sher Khan managed to achieve a net profit of ₹3,94,000 from his flock of 1,800 birds. Witnessing Khan’s remarkable success, three other young individuals from the same village were inspired to establish their own poultry units. Fish farming generates sustainable income (KVK, Chitrakoot) Shri Dinesh Jaiswal, son of Sri Chotaka, is a young farmer having 2 ha of land in a joint family, residing in Itwa village, Ramnagar block, Chitrakoot district, Uttar Pradesh. He was previously unemployed and had been searching for a job everywhere. Finally, he decided to start fish farming along with crop farming. After receiving adequate training on composite fish farming techniques, pre and post stocking management, and other related practices at KVK Chitrakoot, he took the initiative to excavate a pond of 2,500 m2. Mr. Dinesh commenced fish cultivation in 2021–22, under the expert guidance of KVK Scientists. He stocked 5 g sized fingerling of Catla, Rohu, Nain, and Pungasius at a rate of 10,000/ha. He efficiently manages floating fish feed and water quality with application of lime and disinfectants by following recommended practice. He has harvested fish yield up to 118.40 q/ha with B:C ratio of 1.40. In the region, fish farming had traditionally been limited to select families from the Kewat, Raikwar, and Nishad communities. The training and demonstration motivated farmers to adopt fish farming in scientific way in available ponds in the district. Dinesh Jaiswal’s success has become a source of inspiration for those seeking employment opportunities. Not only it increased his income, but it has also opened up employment prospects for others. He is enthusiastic to share his knowledge and success with others, spreading awareness about this system throughout the district and state. Under his guidance, 15–20 farmers came forward to adopt fish farming with pangasius variety. Potato and banana chips proved as profitable enterprise (KVK, Piprakothi) Smt.
