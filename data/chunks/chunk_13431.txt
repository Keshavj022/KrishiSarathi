 Collaborative efforts of ICRISAT, the National Seeds Corporation, State Seed Corporations, ICAR institutes and State Agricultural Universities and State Agriculture Departments led to expansion of area under hybrid pigeonpea to 200,000 ha by 2016 and it is further expected to expand in coming years to the benefit of smallholder farmers. yy Drought-tolerant groundnut variety, ICGV 91114 is replacing the 60-year-old TMV 2, which dominated groundnut production in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. yy Of the more than 30 sorghum hybrids cultivated during the rainy season on 3 million ha in India, 55% are based on ICRISAT-bred parental lines or derivatives. The first sweet sorghum hybrid CSH 22SS was released in 2005 by the National Research Center for Sorghum, Hyderabad which used the ICRISAT-bred female parent ICSA38. yy About 6 million ha area in India is under pearl millet hybrid cultivation, and 60% of about 100 pearl millet hybrids developed since 2000 by the NARS and seed companies in India are based on ICRISAT-bred material. ICRISAT in collaboration with NARS developed downy mildew resistant version (in 2011) of extra-early pearl millet hybrid HHB67, which was grown on about 875,000 ha in the most drought prone environment of north-western India. ICRISAT also bred the first biofortified cultivar of pearl millet ‘Dhanshakti’ with high grain Fe content of 72ppm. It was notified for release for all India cultivation in April 2014, and biofortified pearl millet hybrid ICMH 1201 is being marketed in north Indian states starting 2014. ICAR-CGIAR Agricultural Cooperation 36 yy Work on watershed activities began in 2003 under the Sujala project covering 3,700 ha. Today the Bhoochetana project in Karnataka covers 7 million ha. 2.ii. Contribution during last one year yy ICRISAT maintains six crop improvement programs in India. These programs released elite lines into National Performance/Variety Trials in 2016 for pearl millet (62), finger millet (0), sorghum(1), pigeonpea (33), chickpea (75) and groundnut (228). yy ICRISAT and its partners (NARS scientists and extension staff, including NGOs and farmers’ groups) produced and distributed over 16,000 t of seed for its mandate crops in 2016. yy Integrated soil, water, nutrient, seed and crop management practices in India were scaled up in partnership with the respective state governments across ~6 million hectares in two Indian states, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Increases in crop yield and incomes ~10-50% were recorded in these states compared to traditionally managed farmers’ fields. yy ICRISAT is working with national and international research institutes, NGOs and government departments and private companies under Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives to establish over 15 pilot watersheds (2000 ha to 5000 ha) in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh covering ~70,000 ha with more than 50,000 farming families.
