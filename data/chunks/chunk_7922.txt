 In absence of a proper disposal method of lac mud, it causes pollution. Enriched lac mud application ensures quality vegetable production, saving of inorganic fertilizers, improvement in soil fertility status and moreover it may give another diversified dimension to lac industry, which may be helpful to sustain the lac production system. Application of decomposed enriched lac mud in vegetables produced 22.0, 22.5 and 18.3% higher yield of brinjal, tomato and spinach, respectively, over 100% N through inorganic source (farmers’ practice). This technology saves 48% of N and P fertilizers, and 65% of K fertilizer in brinjal and tomato. In spinach, similar saving in N and P fertilizers along with 36.6% saving of K fertilizers was recorded. Application of fortified lac mud in floriculture produced 31.7 and 38.5% higher flower yield of rose and chrysanthemum, respectively, over conventional method of manuring, ensuring saving of 5 kg and 700 g of manure/ plant in rose and chrysanthemum, respectively. Crop management Long-term effect of weed management: In wheat, major weed flora was Medicago denticulate (64.2%), Vicia sativa (10.9%), Euphorbia geniculate (7.0%), Physalis minima (4.4%), Cichorium intybus (3.9%) and Phalaris minor (3.1%) apart from these weeds like Paspalidium sp. (2.2%), Sonchus arvensis (2.2%), Convolvulus arvensis (1.7%) and Chenopodium album (0.4%) were also present in meager numbers. Among weed management practices, pendimethalin (750 g/ SOIL AND WATER PRODUCTIVITY DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 16 ha), followed by (fb) mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron (12+2.4 g/ha) registered 97.4% of weed control efficiency closely followed by mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron (12 + 2.4 g/ha) at 25 DAS fb 1 HW at 40 DAS. The highest grain yield (5.61 tonnes/ha) of wheat was recorded with two hand weeding (20 and 40 DAS) which was statistically comparable to mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron (12 + 2.4) fb 1 HW (5.48 tonnes/ha) and lowest with control (1.95 tonnes/ha). In soybean, Echinochloa colona (26.0%), Dinebraret roflexa (10.6%), Cyper usiria (15.9%), Euphorbia geniculate (17.4%), Convolvulus arvensis (2.6%), Commelina benghalensis (16.2%), Physalis minima (1.9%) and Phyllanthus niruri (9.4%) were major weed flora. Among weed control measures, maximum weed control efficiency (93.7%) was recorded with two hand weeding (20 and 40 DAS), followed by imazethapyr (100 g/ha) fb one hand weeding (87.6%). The better weed control leads to harvest the highest seed yield (1.05 tonnes/ha) of soybean with two hand weeding followed by imazethapyr (100 g/ha) fb one hand weeding (0.86 tonnes/ha) and lowest with control (0.28 tonnes/ha). Terrestrial weed based phyto-remediation system: The phyto-remediation system consisted of pretreatment overhead settling zone and treatment zone having three pairs of sequential tanks (3m × 2m × 0.75 m). The fast growing terrestrial weeds, Typh alatifolia and Vetiveria, were planted in two rows of tanks separately filled with porous media.
