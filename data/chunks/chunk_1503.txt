 Millets as source of fodder: Millets are the major cereals of dryland crops in arid and semi-arid regions and form an important source of stover for the livestock of these regions. They serve as an excellent source of fodder under rainfed agriculture where water availability is limited. These crops are highly resilient to drought and can thrive in challenging environments, making them a reliable option for livestock feed when other forages may be scarce. The leaves and stem of millet provide nutritious fodder, rich in essential nutrients like fibre, protein, and minerals, which support healthy livestock growth and productivity. Additionally, after grain harvest, the remaining biomass can be used as silage or dry fodder, ensuring minimal waste, and maximizing the crop’s utility in sustainable farming systems. Crop management practices: Transplanting millets like finger millet can be advantageous, particularly when direct sowing fails or when early sowing of the next crop is required, or the previous crop has been harvested late. This ensures uniform crop establishment and better plant health. Additionally, millets can be intercropped with commercial crops. Their narrow leaves reduce shading on the main crop and enhance light absorption, optimizing the use of above- and below-ground resources and reducing pollution. Post-harvest processing: Millet-based food products are increasingly available in the market. In dryland areas with uncertain rainfall or seasonal moisture, harvested millets can be processed into various food items catering to local and non-local preferences. This not only generates off-season income but also promotes innovative millet products, either alone or combined with other grains, offering tastes like conventional foods. Such initiatives can enhance dietary balance and leverage traditional millet-based culinary knowledge. Institutional support: There is a need for developing high-yielding millet varieties that can withstand monsoon variability, temperature fluctuations, low soil fertility, pests, and diseases. Research on grain and fodder requirements, quick stress recovery, and other traits should be a priority for both government and private sectors. Ensuring timely availability of seeds for these developed varieties is crucial for successful crop sowing. Additionally, raising awareness through extension activities about the benefits of including millets in farming and diets is essential. Enhanced market facilities can boost the sales of harvested millets, preventing post-harvest losses. Specific millets for marginal lands and problematic soils • Pearl millet: Grows well in sandy and low-fertility soils. Tolerates drought and saline soils and ideal for dryland regions with poor irrigation facilities. • Sorghum: Grows in a wide range of soil types, including infertile and marginal soils, tolerates drought and waterlogging and ideal for dryland regions.
