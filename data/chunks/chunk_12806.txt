   Particularly in case of chickpea, lentil, barley, bajra, pigeonpea and groundnut in seed chain for which Universities and public institutions will have to share the responsibility in popularizing the improved varieties by seed production and making them available to the farmers at reasonable rates and also for rigorous monitoring in seed supply chain for increasing seed replacement rate.   Creation of community-based low energy vegetable seed village hubs to increase availability of quality seed materials.   Crop diversification and intensification as risk mitigating mechanism-Agricultural 633 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 diversification towards high-value crops can potentially increase farm incomes as demand for high-value food products has been increasing more quickly than that for staple crops. The non-traditional areas may include shifting orientation from cereal dominance to high value crops like horticulture and livestock. Even, as pulses are becoming a high value commodity, shift in favour of pulses can meet the nutritional as well as income security.   Promoting pulse production as high value crops as Central Government has lifted curbs on export of pulses to protect farmers’ income. India has produced a record 22.95 million tonnes of pulses in 2016-17 crop year (June-July) and Government is targeting to repeat this performance this year also. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has given its approval for removal of prohibition on export of all type of pulses to ensure that farmers have greater choice in marketing their produce and in getting better remuneration. Export of pulses will provide an alternative market for surplus production. Pules production can be enhanced into the respective zone with potential varieties and management practices.   Replacement of tradition flood method of irrigation with furrow method of irrigation in Broad Bed Furrow (BBF), Bed Planting and Furrow Irrigated Raised Bed (FIRB) systems for improving irrigation efficiency by 40-50% and production by 20 to 25% over flat method of crop establishment.   Promoting micro-irrigation like drip irrigation with fertigation concept in high value crops like protected vegetables and flowers cultivation, orchard and sprinkler irrigation in undulating topography for improving irrigation efficiency by 60 to 80%.   Rejuvenation of senile orchards for increasing productivity in mango, guava, ber and aonla as most of the orchard in Uttar Pradesh is old.
