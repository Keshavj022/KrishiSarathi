 It was observed that lime juice and turmeric powder are not applied while smoking (frying) on hay. The fish are smoked either with jalebi colour or without it. The results of matrix scoring by 25 key informants (fishermen) on 14 criteria for four treatments are given in Table 1. Results obtained indicate that: 1. Duration of preservation (keeping quality) was maximum in keeping the fish in ice, followed by smoking on hay and least in smoked fish with lime juice + turmeric powder and salt. 2. Taste, colour, shine, marketability, transportability and profitability were found maximum in smoking on hay after putting jalebi colour and least in keeping in ice, except in case of marketability which was lowest in smoked fish with lime juice + turmeric and salt. 3. Keeping in ice was considered best regarding variability of species in processing and gender specification. It was least in smoked fish with lime juice + turmeric and salt. 4. Smoking on hay was found best in respect of easiness in processing, less time in processing, input availability, less use of labour and less cost in processing  FISHERIES TABLE 1.

SMOKED PATOLA FISH  FISHERIES Keeping in ice was found worst on most of these criteria except in for easiness in processing and less time in processing, where smoked fish with lime + turmeric and salt was found to be least preferred. 5. Fish smoking on hay after putting jalebi colour was reported to be the best method to preserve the fish for 12 to 24 hours. By that time fishermen can arrange for their sale to get the maximum profitability and least spoilage. 6. Analysis of variances (ANOVA) indicated the difference between treatments as significant Field experiment The results in respect of average score on fish quality, marketability, consumability and market rates for both processed and unprocessed fish (darhee) at 6 hourly intervals separately for Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh) and Badaun (Uttar Pradesh) villages are given in Table 2. The results suggest that: 1. Processed fish are considered better by the fishermen of Madhya Pradesh in respect of quality as well as in case of market rates even at fresh stage.
