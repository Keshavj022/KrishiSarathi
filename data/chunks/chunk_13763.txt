Agriculture 2023, 13, 1390 14 of 24 Resistant starch (RS) is known as undigested starch. The effect of parboiling increased RS and decreased RDS [7]. The RS and RDS concentrations of uncooked parboiled rice with a high level of amylose were signiﬁcantly greater than those of waxy and medium-amylose varieties [92]. Unprocessed, uncooked rice has low starch resistance towards digestibility, whereas cooking rice increases starch digestibility. Slight parboiling increased RS, which is resistant to small intestinal digestion. However, gut microbes can ferment it, releasing butyric acids that are beneﬁcial to colon health, including via inhibiting prevention of colon health [95]. The cooked grain amylolysis method is explained as a proxy for glycemic index (GI) measurements. In vitro techniques aid in deﬁning rice varieties and estimating amylolysis in cooked grains. The GI measures the proportional increase in blood glucose two hours after consuming food [89]. The estimated GI of samples of fortiﬁed parboiled rice ranged from 50.97 to 59.79, which was lower than that of unfortiﬁed parboiled rice (58.80 to 62.53) and raw rice (78.71 to 84.4) [91]. A range of low-to-moderate GI values was also reported for the fortiﬁed rice [96]. It has been discovered that heat treatment during parboiling debranches amylopectin and creates linear amylose molecules, hence decreasing the GI of rice [79]. The amylose–lipid complex forms more efﬁciently during parboiling and remains insoluble in water, making it more resistant to enzyme hydrolysis [94]. In addition, the amylose– lipid complex produced during parboiling enhances grain toughness by altering the rice’s structure, resulting in a low GI. Thus, parboiling under pressure could be extremely beneﬁcial, especially for producing cooked rice with a lower GI [90]. The reduced digestibility of rice was attributable to the higher gel network formation during gelatinization and retrogradation of amylopectin, particularly in parboiled rice, which inhibited enzymatic activity during the oral to gastrointestinal phases [7,26,97]. The results demonstrated that the hydrolysis extent of parboiled rice was less than that of the control rice, indicating the establishment of a harder structure in the rice after parboiling and drying treatment, as corroborated by a previously published study [5]. A lower percentage of starch hydrolysis was reported in rice that had been pressure-cooked compared to non-parboiled rice [90].
