 Rajasthan has shown a gradual shift from a moderate to one of the major contributors of India's agricultural emissions over a decade. A similar trend is also seen in Madhya Pradesh. Other non-IGP states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra show similar projections but with a more gradual shift. 4.4. Comparison with existing emission estimates We compared our CH4, CO2, and CO emission estimates with those from five inventories (see Section 3.5). Only FEER and GFAS provided estimates for N2O; hence we used only these two inventories for comparing our CO2e estimates.

M.V. Deshpande et al. Science of the Total Environment 904 (2023) 166944 10 emissions from the selected inventories over Indian agricultural areas. Our estimates for CH4, CO2 and CO are approximately 40 % and 25 % higher than those of GFAS and QFED, respectively, but almost 70–80 % lower than the estimates provided by FEER, FINN v1.5, and FINN v2.5. For N2O emissions, GFAS and FEER are nearly 20 % and 82 % higher than our estimates. Similar levels of discrepancies among global in­ ventory estimates are also reported by Wiedinmyer et al. (2023), which compared emissions estimated from FINN v2.5 with those estimated from FINN v1.5, GFAS, FEER and QFED. 4.5. Uncertainty estimation As mentioned in Section 3.5, we estimated the uncertainty for different parameters used in Eqs. (1) and (2) from the available litera­ ture.
