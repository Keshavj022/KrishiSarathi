 Determination of safe concentrations: Safe concentration of the extracts were determined by using 1, 10, 100, 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 mg/ml extract of babool or jamun in BHK21 cell monolayer for 96 hr. Determination of viable cells: The confluent monolayers of both BHK2| and vero cells were treated with different concentrations (as indicated below) with appropriate controls and then incubated in an incubator at 37°C for 72 hr under 5% CO2. After the incubation period, the cells were treated with trypsin to detach the cells from the surface and then the cells were stained with 0.4% Trypan blue. Antiviral activity against blue-tongue virus serotype: Initially, the vero cells were put for 24 hr in a 24 well-cell culture plate (Nunc). The cells were washed with 2% EME medium. Then 100 TCID50/100 ml BTV serotype 23 was infected in duplicates and allowed to adsorb for 1 hr. The unadsorbed virus was removed by washing the cell monolayers with 2% EME medium. Further the monolayers were fed with different concentrations of babool (10, 40, 50 and 100 mg/ ml) and jamun (10, 100, 800 and 1000 mg/ml) separately with appropriate virus and cell controls. The plates were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 72 hr and the readings were noted. Antiviral activity against goat-pox virus (GPV): The experiment was conducted as above for GPV, i.e. by using both direct and indirect methods for all the extracts. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Determination of safe concentration showed that 1,000 mg/ml and higher concentrations induced rounding of cells as early as at 24 hr. The rest of the concentrations and BHK2] control cells remained normal. Similar results were also noticed with vero cell lines as early as at 24 hr and up to 120 hr. The total, viable and percentage of viable cells were counted or calculated and the results are given in Table 1. When tested against blue-tongue virus, cytopathic changes (CP) were observed in all the wells with all the concentrations of babool and Table 1. Total, viable and percentage of viable cells at different concentrations of babool and jamun extracts at IVRI Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE jamun bark extracts treated except the cell control. This indicates that the aqueous extract of babool, at concentration mentioned, does not inhibit blue- tongue virus serotype 23. Further, the titration of the virus was carried out from each concentration in vero cell line. The titre of the virus control and infected cells treated with different concentrations remained 106 66TCID50/ml. There was no reduction in the titre of the virus compared to that of the virus control. Against GPV there was 4 log inhibition of the titre by babool extract at 1/ 100,4/100, 5/100 and 10/lOOpil concentrations both in direct and indirect methods. Jamun inhibited at 100/100, 500/100, 1000 u.g/100 M-l. The 10 p.
