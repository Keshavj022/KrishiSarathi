The animals of T2 or ITK treatment group recovered within 5 – 6 days, whereas T3 group (karala treatment) took 6 – 7 days to recover. The animals of T 4 (neem oil treatment) recovered after 8–9 days, but in T 5 or conventional treated group with veterinary medicine, the animals recovered within 4–5 days. Clinical improvement The clinical improvement was marked both in ITK treated group (T 2) and in conventional treated group (T 5), but moderate and slow in T3 and T 4 treatment is very high, whereas the karala and neem oil treatment involves moderate costs. The ITK is highly cost effective. Health improvement ITK and karala treatment showed moderate, and neem oil treatment was found to be poor for health improvement. Conventional method achieved the highest score in this regard. Milk yield Maximum improvement was observed in conventional treatment, followed by ITK method, whereas other methods showed poor improvements in milk yield.

VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY improvement of milk yield was noted in the ITK treated group and conventionally treated group. In other groups less improvement was observed (Table 3). Data presented in Table 3 show that there was decrease in milk yield in all five groups after the infection of FMD from their early healthy conditions.
