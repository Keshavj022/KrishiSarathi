 The Animal Science institutes of ICAR, particularly, ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute (ICAR-IVRI) played a pivotal role in eradication of the dreaded disease, Rinderpest, from the country with the development of vaccine against it. However, other diseases leading to major economic losses, such as Foot-and- Mouth Disease (FMD), demand their effective control and the ultimate target is their eradication. ICAR-IVRI has developed and commercialized several vaccines from time-to-time to meet the challenges of existing, emerging and re-emerging diseases of livestock and poultry. There is a constant endeavor to develop and enhance vaccines for different infectious diseases of livestock and poultry. Introduction 2 Besides ensuring optimal livestock productivity, protecting human health from zoonotic diseases entails prevention, control and eradication of animal diseases through use of cost-effective and efficacious vaccines. The Animal Science institutes of ICAR have worked hard to meet this requirement. The biologicals including vaccines developed by ICAR-IVRI were supplied throughout the geographical area of the then British India as well as whole of the independent India (Fig 1). Besides developing vaccines against many important animal diseases for control of various diseases, the Animal Science institutes of ICAR are also contributing indirectly in disease control by playing key central role in developing trained human resource in the area of animal health by teaching and training veterinarians on various aspects of vaccines/diagnostics production and quality control through different P.G./Diploma programmes. Further, they are also entrusted with the job of supplying various vaccine seed cultures and challenge strains to the manufacturers including state biological production units to ensure quality of biologicals and harmonize the vaccines being produced and used in the country.
