 Colouring: This process is generally adopted for the marketing purpose, as the colour of the rhizomes affect the sale of products, so some amount of turmeric powder after mixing with little water is sprinkled over the rhizomes after polishing. Yield: The average yield of turmeric is about 8–10 tonnes/ ha. In some cases, if the climatic factors supports then the resulting yield becomes around 12 tonnes/ha (Table 2). SUMMARY Curcumin percentage is a very important factor from the point of view of the use of rhizome in spices and medicine. The cured turmeric has given medium curcumin yield after curing practices. This whole article is based on varietal experiments of the turmeric in the Bundelkhand region in the barren land for spreading the idea of turmeric as cash crop for doubling the farmer’s income which was observed to be significantly enhanced in previous years by various factorial observations. The input used for cultivation was from the farm resources and the organic cultivation technique was followed. The output obtained by following the organic cultivation practice is quite promising. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: gurudayal20195@gmail.com Table 2.
