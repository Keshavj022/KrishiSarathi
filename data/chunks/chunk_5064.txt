HORTICULTURAL CROPS Fig. 7. Effect of aged, sheep urine spray, on the number of aphids per plant Migration and death. Undiluted aged sheep urine spray was effective as insecticide and eradicated the aphid population by day 20. No effect on the number of leaves and plant height was observed. Effect of different concentrations of fresh sheep urine spray on aphid population and growth of cabbage The results of this experiment are given in Tables 8 and 9 and Fig. 8. Control (unsprayed) cabbage showed a continuous increase, followed by plateau in aphid population. The balance achieved may be due to gain through birth and loss through migration and death. Undiluted fresh sheep urine spray eradicated the aphid population completely by day 30. Undiluted fresh sheep urine treatment also showedno significant effect on the number of leaves and plant height. Against aged and fresh sheep urine, the former appears to more effective than the latter in controlling aphids though only Fig. 8.
