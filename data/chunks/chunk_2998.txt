 North western and north‐ eastern hills of the country. Agro‐techniques Potato based intensive cropping systems • Suitable varieties of rice, potato and wheat were identified for rice‐potato‐wheat cropping system in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. www.icar.org.in 9 2002‐2007 • Potato‐groundnut‐til was economically viable crop sequence in Gujarat. • Paddy‐potato‐okra gave higher production and net returns in West Bengal and Orissa. • Blackgram‐potato‐okra gave higher production and net returns in Assam. • Potato‐garlic in ratio of 1:1 in hills of J&K and Uttrakhand and in the ratio of 1:2 in Karnataka was found profitable. Yield maximization • Maximum tuber yields and net returns were obtained by fertilizing the crop with 275 kg N, 137.5 kg P2O5, 275 kg K2O and 25 t/ha FYM in Gujarat (as against earlier recommended dose of 240 : 100 : 150 NPK). • Maximum tuber yields and net returns were obtained by fertilizing the crop with 187.5 kg N, 125 kg P2O5, 125 kg K2O and 25 t/ha FYM in Rajasthan (as against earlier recommended dose of 120 : 100 : 100 NPK). • Similarly, doses of NPK need to be revised upwardly by 50% in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh for maximizing potato yields and net returns. Fertilizer economy • In potato‐onion‐groundnut and potato‐wheat‐cowpea systems in Punjab, residue incorporation of each crop could economize on NPK by 50% in succeeding crops after potato. • For economizing 25% N and P, it was recommended to soak tubers in a solution containing 1% each of urea and sodium bicarbonate along with seed treatment with Azatobacter + Phosphobacteria. Seed research • For maximizing the number of seed sized tubers (upto 50 g), crop should be planted at 60 x 10/15 cm spacing and fertilized with 150 kg N, 150 kg P2O5 and 80 kg K2O/ha and haulms be cut at 80 days at most of the seed producing areas. Management of diseases and insect pests Eco‐friendly management of diseases and insect pests • Effective strains of bio‐control agents viz., Trichoderma viride and Bacillus subtilis were submitted to IMTECH, Chandigarh for registration. • Field use of Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis for control of bacterial wilt was recommended in Karnataka. • Trichoderma viride was recommended for control of black scurf. • Trap crops like marigold and castor were recommended for management of Agrotis sp., jassids, etc. • Eco‐friendly treatment (3% boric acid) of seed tubers was developed for the control of tuber borne fungal/bacterial diseases. www.icar.org.in 10 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Horticulture • Safer pesticides like imidacloprid identified for replacing methyl‐demeton/ monocrotophos/ phorate for control of insect pests.
