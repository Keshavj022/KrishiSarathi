Antibiogram profile of different extracts of Kala jeera against Pasteurella In-vitro antimicrobial study: Out of six extracts tested, chloroform, acetone and methanol gave better anti-bacterial effect than other three extracts. All the control discs did not show any zone of inhibition. The range of zone of inhibitions was 15-19 mm in chloroform extract, 10-16 mm in acetone extract, 5-23 mm in methanol extract, 6- 27.5 mm in ether extract, 4.5-11.5 mm in benzene extract and 0-7.5 mm in aqueous extract, indicating that the first four extracts had better anti-bacterial property against the causative organism of haemorrhagic septicemia (Table 2, Fig. 1). Hot aqueous extract showed only mild zone of inhibition (7.5 mm) at 32 mg concentration. Antibiogram of various fractions of methanol extract: Fractionation of metholic extract of kala jeera seed (Vernonia anthelmintic a) was conducted by solvent technique to further Table 2.
