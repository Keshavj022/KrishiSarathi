 The cropped area in this zone covers 32,91,000 ha which is the highest among all the three agro climatic zones. Bastar Plateau: It accounts for 29% of total geographical area with districts of Jagdalpur, Dantewada, Beejapur, Narayanpur and remaining part of Kanker with a cropped area of 6,37,000 ha. Northern Hills: The area of this agro-climatic zone accounts for 21% of total geographical area that covers districts of Sarguja, Korba, Jashpur and Dharamjaigarh Tehsil of Raigarh districts having cropped area of 8,34,000 ha. Rice is the major crop of the state grown in every district and it is perhaps because of this reason that Chhattisgarh is known as “Rice Bowl of India”. The three agro-climatic zones in Chhattisgarh is having a different type of soil. However, generally the common types like black and red soils, sandy loam and loamy sands are found in all the districts. State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 82 5.1 Productivity Gaps and Major Constraints There are critical gaps or constraints that are hindering the growth and productivity on sustainable basis in agriculture and allied sectors in the state. Some of the factors identified are as follows:   Insufficient investment in the primary sector (other than mining).   Insufficient infrastructure for meeting various needs of agriculture and allied sectors creating hindrance in adequate and timely delivery of critical inputs.   Low Seed Replacement Rate (SRR) for various crops and non availability of quality planting material.   Lack of crop diversification, horizontal as well as vertical.   Low soil pH, high erodibility, low soil fertility and predominance of light soils with low water retention capacity.   Incidence of insects, pests and diseases crops.   Lack of effective and responsive extension services.   Limited irrigation facilities; lack of assured irrigation as well as of systems and methods for higher water use efficiency.   Erratic and uneven distribution of rainfall and wide fluctuations in other climatic parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind velocity etc.   Non-availability of human power (Agricultural labour) during the peak period of agricultural operations.   Prevalence of non-descript/ desi type of livestock including poultry with poor management practices in rural area.   Open grazing by livestock.   Deficit green and dry fodder as well as feed for livestock, poultry and fisheries.   Unmanaged and depleting community pasturelands.   Inadequate diagnostic facilities at field level especially in Veterinary and Fisheries.   Poor veterinary health coverage.   Deficit supply of fishing equipments especially modern ones.   Lack of value addition/processing centres especially in rural areas.   Absence of certification for organic produce.   Lack of proper facilities at market places as well as lack of marketing net-work (backward and forward linkages) for the produce from agriculture and allied sectors.
