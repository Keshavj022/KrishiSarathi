 Consequent to slow progress of genetic improvement in indigenous pigs and higher demand for pork, crossbreeding of native pigs with exotic boars gained momentum in different parts of the country. The ICAR-National Research Center on Pig and the centres of AICRP on Pig developed nine high yielding crossbred pig varieties suitable for different agro-climatic condition of the country as given below. 1. Rani (50% Hampshire: 50% Ghungroo) developed at NRC on Pig, Guwahati attains 75 kg body weight at slaughter (8 months) with 1.98 cm of back fat thickness with litter size 9-10. 2. Asha (50% Duroc:25% Ghngroo: 25% Hampshire) developed at NRC on Pig, Guwahati attains 80 kg lean pork at slaughter age of 8 months with 1.75 cm back fat thickness with litter size 8-9. 3. HD-K75 (Hampshire 75%; local 25%) developed at AAU Guwahati attain 74 kg body weight at slaughter age of 8 months with 2.58 cm of back fat thickness and litter size 8-9. 4. Jharsuk (50%Tamworth: 50% local pigs) developed at BAU, Ranchi attains 80 kg body weight at slaughter age (8-10 months) and litter size 8-12 with two farrowing/year. 5. Mannuthy White (75% Large White Yorkshire: 25% Desi) developed at KAU, Mannuthy attains 94 kg body weight at slaughter age (10 months) with 2.10 cm of back fat thickness and litter size 8-9. 6. Lumsniang (50% Niang Megha: 50% Hampshire) developed at ICAR-RC for NEH Region, Barapani attains 90-100 kg body weight at 12 months of age and litter size 8-9. 7. TANUVAS KPM Gold (75% Large White Yorkshire: 25% Desi) developed at TANUVAS, Chennai attains 80 to 85 kg body weight at 8 months with litter size 8-9. 8. SVVU-T17 (75% Large White Yorkshire: 25% Desi) developed at SVVU, Tirupati attains 85 kg body weight at slaughter age of 10 months with litter size 8-9. 9. Landlly (75% Landrace: 25% Gurrah) developed at ICAR-IVRI Izatnagar attains 85-95 Kg body weight at slaughter age (8 month) with litter size 7-9. Average litter size at birth of crossbred varieties ranges from 8-10 compared to 5-6 in indigenous pigs. Average body weight at slaughter age (8 months) in indigenous pigs is 40-50 kg, whereas the crossbreds attain 75-90 kg at slaughter age. Assuming rearing of one indigenous sow with average litter size of 5.5 and average body weight of 45 kg/animal, a farmer can produce approximately 250 kg pork in one year and earn Rs 25000 by selling of pig @ Rs. 100 kg-1 of pork. On the other hand, keeping improved crossbred sow with average litter size of 9.5 and average body weight of 75 kg/animal, a farmer produces about 700 kg pork and earn Rs. 70000 per year. 3.5. Poultry Poultry is one of the major sectors of agriculture in India. ICAR has pivotal role in shaping up both organized and un-organized poultry sectors through its research programmes including AICRP and Poultry seed projects and producing highly skilled manpower for manning the Indian poultry sector.
