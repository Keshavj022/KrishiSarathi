They are marine macrophytic thallophytes consisting of taxonomically distinguished groups of green (Chlorophyta), brown (Phaeophyta) and red (Rhodophyta) seaweeds. The commercially exploited seaweed species in India mainly include Gracilaria edulis, Gelidiella acerosa, Kappaphycus alvarezii, Sargassum spp. and Turbinaria spp. Seaweed farmers in India are generally small-scale farmers, and the main culture methods include either vegetative propagation using fragments from mother plants or by different kinds of spores. These marine macroflora are gaining immense attention in nutraceutical industries due to their protective function against various chronic diseases. Indian nutraceuticals market has been growing at the compound annual growth rate of 20 percent for the past three years, particularly in the segments of functional food products, antioxidants, and immunity boosters. These developments point towards the fast proliferation of the specific segments of nutraceuticals in India and its acceptance by the Indian consumers and healthcare providers. With increasing health awareness and the shift towards preventive health care, India’s future in this segment is promising. Recent efforts by the government to bring about clarity in regulatory protocols with regard to nutraceutical products have also augmented the rapid growth of this segment. The most interesting marine phyla with respect to pharmacologically active marine compounds include the abundantly available seaweed species, which are potential Introduction Aerial view of seaweed farm, Thondi, Tamil Nadu 1 sources of bioactive substances. Novel secondary bioactive metabolites from the seaweeds address the concerns about the toxic effects of synthetic drugs to a great extent. Considering this, ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) and ICAR-Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT) designed specialized research programmes to systematically probe these candidate seaweed species for their relevance to human health. The continued research efforts at these institutes helped in the identification of a library of bioactive molecules from seaweeds for use against various life-threatening diseases.
