The variety has shown a genetic potential of 71.1 q/ha • The proposed variety HD 3086 has shown a very high level of resistance against stripe rust and leaf rust with slow-rusting type of APR reactions compared to checks and qualifying varietiy, which showed susceptible reaction in fields and in artificial conditions. • The proposed variety HD 3086 is an Indian bred non- 1B/1R material, will add to diversity in the varietal pattern of the NWPZ as the two of the other varieties, PBW 621-50 and HD 3059, already notified for cultivation as well, and the qualifying variety DBW 88, which has common parentage, originating from the CIMMYT nurseries.
