 Observations were recorded on insect infestation on the crops, yield, additional return and cost: benefit under different treatments. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results obtained from the experiments conducted at various centres mentioned earlier were pooled and presented. The results of the effects of different treatments on control of insect- pests, yield and additional return are given in Table 1 for cucurbits, cowpea and okra. In cowpea spraying by insecticide (tobacco+cow urine mixture) was effective in reducing the incidence of fruit borer (8.75 to 14.94%), though the chemical insecticide was most effective. The highest fruit yield (53 to 131 q/ha) was recorded by chemical insecticide, followed by ITK method (51.4 to 105.6 q/ha). These two treatments were superior to the control in all cases. In cucurbits, the application of chemical insecticide and ITK method were more effective in controlling pod borers than the control. At BCKV, West Bengal the chemical treatment and ITK method were at par. In cucurbits the chemical control was most effective, followed by ITK method in all the cases. In-vitro studies on the effect of cow urine mixed with tobacco-soaked water and chemical control on the mortality of insect pests of cucurbits, cowpea and lady's finger was done at Regional Center of CTCRI at Bhubneshwar. The in vitro bioassay tests revealed that the cow-urine mixed with tobacco-soaked water was equally effective in slowing the knock-down effect and mortality of Helicoverpa armigera on bitter gourd lady's finger and Acyrthosiphum pisum on cowpea. When compared with the systemic insecticide application, both insecticide and the ITK methods showed very high knok-down effect of the pest, showing that some active principles Table 1.
