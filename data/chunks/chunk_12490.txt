 Major share of power available for agricultural operations is of animate energy (54%) followed by mechanical (43%) and electrical (3%). The state has undulating topography and Fragmented land holding; Majority of the farmers are small and marginal (84%).   Adoption of Improved Agricultural Implements and Machinery by demonstration of improved agricultural implements and machinery done through KVKs, SAMETI, ATMA,NFSM, NHM, MIDH   Making agricultural implement banks in all 24 districts (3 in each panchayat).   Involving industries for ensuring the availability of implements at subsidized rates. 245 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Agro-forestry:   About 30% of the Geographical area i.e. 24 lakh ha land is fit for agro- forestry activities. Poor nutrient status of degraded lands and Non-existent of wood/ bamboo based industriesare main constraints   Plantation of Multipurpose trees species like Gamhar, Eucalyptus, bamboo, neem, lachosts (Berand Palas), etc. on bunds of farms and waste land; Nursery establishment andPlant distribution to farmers   Improvement of nutrient status of soil by increasing organic residue from < 0.5 to > 2.0% through Agri-silviculture, Horti-silvi Pastoral system. Tree, Crops, Grasses – litterdecomposition   Production of fodder grass under silvi pasture system by planting fodder tree viz. Subabool, Ficussp. and grasses viz. Dinanath, Napiers, Sudan, Guinea grass etc. on community land to increase the area from 0.15 lakh ha to 0.50 lakh ha. Lac Production Jharkhand - the leading state in lac production (60% of national production). 25-32% of total farm income in major lac growing areas comes from lac cultivation. It is a major source of livelihood and income generation especially for tribal farmers in rain-fed areas. About one million man-days are generated in the existing lac processing units alone. Lac cultivation is an important vocation for inhabitants of 45 out of 150 disadvantaged districts   Policy interventions:   Formation of National / State Lac Development Board   Declaring lac as agricultural produce   Effective implementation of MSP   Establishment of Regional Testing Laboratories   Credit and insurance to lac growers   Increasing production by introducing lac in newer areas   Introducing Lac Integrated Farming System Models for assured livelihood in rain fed Agriculture Tasar Silk Tropical tasar silk is produced only in India. Tasar silk industry provides livelihood to nearly 3.5 lakh families. Tasar silk has high demand in domestic as well as global market. It is a profitable traditional occupation that requires least investment to get good return.   Promotion of Tasar by-product based Enterprises General Recommendations   Increase Net Sown Area: The State suffers from high levels of current fallow, even during Kharif, mainly due to deterioration of soil status, erratic rainfall and lack of seeds.
