Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective transfer of improved mungbean production technologies to convince them to adopt such technologies so that yield gaps can be bridged and mungbean production in the country can be scaled up. Improved packages of practices for summer mungbean Climatic requirements: Mungbean crop is mostly cultivated during spring, summer and kharif, and it could tolerate high temperature up to 400C. A well distributed 60-75 cm rainfall is suitable for better growth and development of crop, but rainfall during flowering are detrimental as it affects pollination and fertilization. Soil type: Fertile sandy loam soils with adequate internal drainage and a pH between 6.3 and 7.2 are ideal for mungbean crop cultivation. It cannot tolerate salinity and can show severe iron chlorosis symptoms and certain micronutrient deficiencies. Improved varieties: Mungbean varieties mature in about 55 to 65 days, which is suitable for the summer season. Short-duration cultivars are cultivated in the summer to enable timely harvesting and timely sowing of the succeeding crop as well as to protect the crop from harm caused by early summer monsoon showers that could degrade seed quality. Sowing time: Summer mungbean crop should be sown immediately after the harvest of wheat/mustard crops. The second fortnight of March month is most suitable for sowing Mungbean fields under cluster frontline demonstrations in NCT Delhi Table 2.
