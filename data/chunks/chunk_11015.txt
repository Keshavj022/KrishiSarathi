Costs and returns as a function of Percentage of initial cost invested by the promoter (` Lakhs) 23 Industrial Level Plant for Prodcution of Biogas/Bio-CNG • Manure (Compost) produced per day from the plant is 45 tonnes. • Number of working days per year is 275 days • Purchase cost of paddy straw and animal dung are ` 2,000 per tonne (which includes ` 1,500 per tonne for collection and transportation and ` 500 per tonne of price for straw or dung) • Selling cost of bio-CNG produced is ` 46 per kg (procurement announced by the oil PSUs). • Selling cost of manure (compost) is ` 500 per tonne. The profit to the promoter increases linearly with the increase in the rate of subsidy (Fig. 2). At a subsidy rate of 50% of the initial investment the annual profit will be ` 209.23 lakhs per year.
