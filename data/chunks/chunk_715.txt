There are several important mobile apps developed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India and other organisations which are using Geographic Information System (GIS) and Data Analytics of Smart Agriculture to deliver accurate information to the farmers at their doorstep. IoT and AI offers wide range of applications in agriculture. Keywords: Artificial intelligence, Digitalization, Information and communication technologies, Mobile apps T IMELY access, affordability and efficiency of agricultural information is very crucial for raising agricultural productivity among especially in the developing countries. Digitalization through various ICT’s can have a leading role in the dissemination of right information to needful farmers at right time. There have been some successful initiatives in India, where digitalization of agricultural information was attempted. In most of these projects, agriculture is only a small component.
