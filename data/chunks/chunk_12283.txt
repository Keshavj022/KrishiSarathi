 The flowering time of both parental lines is same (47 days) (Table 3) and thus no problem in nicking is encountered in certified seed production plots of the hybrid c) Maturity (range in number of days) (from seedling/ : 79 days(Table 4) transplanting to flowering, seed- to- seed) d) Maturity group (early, medium and late wherever : Medium such classification exists) e) Reaction to major diseases under field and : Highly resistant to downy mildewHighly resistant to controlled conditions (reaction to physiological blast (Table 7) (Contd) 233 GUIDELINES FOR TESTING CROP VARIETIES UNDER AICCIPS strains/ races/pathotypes/ bio-types to be indicated wherever possible) f) Reaction to major pests (under field and controlled : Resistant to stem- borer, shoot- fly (Table 8) conditions, including storage pests) g) Agronomic features (e.g. resistance to lodging, : Highly responsive to fertilizers and is suitable for shattering, fertilizer responsiveness, suitability to both early and late planting(Table 6) early or late sown conditions, seed rate etc.) h) Quality of produce : a) Grain quality : Good and acceptable b) Fodder quality : Good and acceptable i) Reaction to stresses : Tolerant 10 Description of the parents of the hybrid : A line/Inbred 1 B line/Inbred 2 R line (Annexure-I) a) Plant height (cm) : 181 cm 180 cm 185 cm b) Distinguishing morphological characters : No bristles No bristles Brown bristles Brown bristles Brown anther yellow anther c) Days to flowering : 47 47 47 d) Days to maturity (range in number of days â€“ : 86 85 79 from seed- to- seed) e) Is there any problem of synchronization? If yes, : No No No method to overcome it f) Reaction to major diseases (under field and : Resistant Resistant Resistant controlled conditions, reaction to physiological strains/ races/bio-types/ pathotypes needs to be indicated wherever possible) g) Reaction to major pests (under field and : Resistant Resistant Resistant controlled conditions, including storage pests) h) Agronomic features (e.g. resistance to lodging, : Highly Highly Highly responsive shattering, fertilizer responsiveness, suitability responsive responsive to fertilizers and to early or late sown conditions, seed rate etc.
