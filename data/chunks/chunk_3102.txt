 Also categories SD (36675 ha) and DSSS (34949 ha) covers 14 and 13.2 per cent of TGA of the district respectively where Zn+Fe and Fe were found deficient.

The Fe deficiency was more prevalent followed by Zn, Mn and Cu deficiency, respectively. Only 0.25 per cent (844.8 ha) (Table 4.1) of the total geographical area of the district was represented by category DDDD which indicated represented the deficiencies of all the four micronutrients (Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn). Similarly, Patiala and other districts such information is being generated ( Fig.4.1) . www.icar.org.in 61 2002‐2007 Fig. 4.1 Digitized map of micronutrient deficient areas in Muktsar district in Punjab Relation between soil properties and micronutrient deficiencies • Relation between soil properties and micronutrient status and percent deficiencies has been worked out so as to forecast and suggest suitable amelioration measures. Fig. 4.2 Relationship in soil properties and micronutrient deficiencies 5. Amelioration of micronutrient deficiencies in cropping system • Several field experiments were conducted to evaluate optimum rate, better source and method of application so as to enhance nutrient use efficiency. New products like Teprosyn zinc phosphate, Granubor II and Gromor sulphur bentonite were tested and found useful in correcting their deficiencies more efficiently. Integrated nutrient management and zinc enrichment to organic manure was tested . Zinc enrichment found better in enhancing zinc use efficiency by 25‐50% over inorganic zinc application alone. Details of these experiments are given below. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 Soil Zn (mg kg-1 soil) Soil Parameters Fig 1.1.
