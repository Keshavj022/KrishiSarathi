 High humidity and cloudy weather with temperatures of 20–220C are favourable climatic conditions to the spread of the disease. Integrated disease management strategies: • Field sanitation. • Seed treatment with Diclobutrazole. • Spraying of biocontrol agents like Chaetomium globosum and Trichoderma koningii just at the time of first disease symptoms appearance. • Preventive sprays of fungicides i.e. Mancozeb (0.25%), Propiconazole (0.1%) and Hexaconazole (0.1%) at early disease development stage. • Cultivation of tolerant/resistant varieties: Fieldpea: Aman, IPF 4-9, Pant Pea 347, HFP 1428, IPF 16-13, Pant Pea 243, Pant Pea 250, IPFD 12-2, HFP 529 etc. Lentil: Kota Masoor 4, LL 1373, IPL 220, IPL 316, Pant L 7, KLS 122, KLB 345, IPL 315, IPL 321, IPL 534, IPL 329, IPL 225, Pant Lentil 11 etc. Ascochyta blight Symptomatology: This is a serious disease of chickpea and lentil. Its occurrence frequency is highest in chickpea and rarely appeared in lentil and field pea. This disease occurs during cool and moist weather. Initial symptoms include appearance of water soaked lesions on leaves and smaller circular brown spots on leaves, pods and stems. Under congenial conditions, these spots expand quickly and coalesce, blighting the leaves and buds. It spreads mainly by the infected seeds produced from infected crops. The wet and warm weather conditions and dense crop canopy are most favourable to the spread of the disease. Integrated disease management strategies: • Crop rotation with non-legume host crops. • Field sanitation. • Foliar spraying of Mancozeb @0.25% at 10–15 days’ intervals. • Soil application of Trichoderma sp. based formulations @2.0–2.5 kg/acre at the time of sowing or seed treatment @10 g/kg of seed at the time of sowing. • Use of tolerant/resistant varieties: Lentil: Pant Lentil – 9, L 4717 etc. Chickpea: Pusa 1103, RSG 807, DKG 986 etc. Fieldpea: Pant Pea 347, HFP 1428, Pant Pea 243, Pant Pea 250 etc. Botrytis grey mould (BGM) Symptomatology: This disease occurs mainly in cool, cloudy and humid weather during crop season. The disease symptoms first Rust infected cool season pulse crops, (a) field pea (b) lentil and (c) chickpea A B C Powdery mildew infected field pea crop Indian Farming 6 August 2023 appear as water-soaked lesions on the stem, near ground level, that later extend along the stem, and lead to the infection of other stems. Branches break-off at the rotting point and the affected leaves and flowers turn into a rotting mass. The fungus can develop light grey or brown to light brown lesions on leaflets, branches and pod. Flowers and pods may abort in affected crop under condition of severe infection, leading to complete yield loss. Integrated disease management strategies: • Field sanitation. • Dry seed dressing with Vinclozolin (Ronilan), or Carbendazim + Thiram combination. • Seed treatment with Trichoderma based formulation i.e. Dalhanderma @10 g/kg of seed at the time of sowing.
