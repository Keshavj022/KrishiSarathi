 Because of this, countries with vaccination programmes aiming at eradication were unsuccessful while the countries with programs of culling seropositive animals could achieve disease free status. The milestones for other cattle and buffalo disease control are given in Table 5. Table 5. Achievement milestones in other diseases of cattle and buffalo for health improvement Year Milestone 1951 Anthrax spore vaccine developed. 1956 Brucella abortus strain19 vaccine developed. 1956-58 Haemorrhagic septicaemia adjuvant vaccine developed. 1979 Bovine Theileria schizont vaccine developed. 2001 ELISA diagnostic kit for IBR and bovine brucellosis developed. 2005 NADRES was developed through “Weather based animal disease forecast (WB_ ADF)” and “Animal health information system through disease monitoring and surveillance (AHIS_DMS)” projects. 2008 AB ELISA for detection of IBR virus antibodies developed. 2013 Buffalo pox vaccine developed. 2020 Brucella abortus S19Δ per vaccine developed.

Small ruminant health management and their impact Small ruminant health management, related technology development and knowledge generation has been a priority activity of ICAR institutes. The important milestones in small ruminant health are shown below in Table 6. Table 6.

Control of Peste des Petits Ruminants and its impact Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), popularly known as “goat plague” is a contagious viral disease of small ruminants caused by a morbillivirus. The disease is found in several countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The control of disease is important from the point of view of livelihood security for millions of families involved in small ruminant husbandry. The important symptoms of PPR include fever, discharge from eyes and nostrils, conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. It was first described in Ivory Coast by Gargadennec and Lalanne in 1942, and in India from Tamil Nadu in the year 1987.
