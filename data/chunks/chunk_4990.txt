Planting of wild sugarcane before infestation by case worm helped obtain yield of rice up to 63.2 to 64.0 q/ ha, which was 68.0 q/ha when insecticide was applied. Untreated plot gave the lowest yield (51.7 q/ha). Substantial reduction in incidence of case- worm, as determined by infestation of hill, was obtained in the experiments conducted at both Vogra (Table 3) and Bhanjanagar village (Table4). However, increase in yield of rice due to planting of wild sugarcane and insecticide application was significant over control at Vogra village. Yield of rice was similar in all the three treatments at Benakunda , as the incidence of caseworm was not observed after 20 DAT.

Almost all the leaves of S. spontaneum provided habitation for spiders. 2. Spider eggs were available in 65% of S. spontaneum implanted in both leaf surface and at the leaf-sheath portion. 3. Spider population was 2–3/m 2 after 5 days of planting of S. spontaneum, which gradually increased to 6–8 after 15 days with small spider nymphs all over the field. 4. Spiders, collected from CRRI, Vogra and Bhanjanagar belongs to 9 types. A tentative identification has been made of 6 spiders which are: Neoscona sp., Araneus sp., Oxyopes sp., Tetragnatha sp., Clubirna sp. and Argeiops sp. 5 . Two types of spiders Araneus sp. and Oxyopes sp. were observed to kill and devour the larvae of caseworm. 6. Web formation is perhaps another mode of action for controlling the caseworm by trapping it at moth stage. 7. High rate of egg-laying of some of the spiders was observed on the broad leaf surface of S.spontaneum, which perhaps helped in spreading the population within less time.
