 y A lack of financial support from institutional sources. y Limited consumer awareness regarding honey and its related products. y Poor quality control measures in honey production. y Ongoing deforestation. y The indiscriminate use of insecticides, pesticides, and weedicides. y The impact of global warming and unforeseen climatic changes. Opportunities The potential for beekeeping development in Northeast India is vast and offers a range of opportunities, including: y Diverse Agro-Climatic Conditions: The region’s varied agro-climatic conditions create an ideal environment for the growth of beekeeping. y Rural Empowerment: Beekeeping presents significant self-help potential for rural communities, tribals, small and marginal farmers, and landless laborers. It opens doors to various opportunities, such as: y Honey, with its high nutritional value, can provide a source of cash income. y Beeswax, valued at twice the price of honey, is in high demand. y Other products like bee-collected pollen, propolis, bee venom, and royal jelly are several times more valuable than honey and beeswax. Bee Pollination Services: Offering bee pollination services to farmers is a mutually beneficial endeavor, increasing crop production while bolstering honeybee productivity—essentially a dual-benefit service. Processing and Value-added Products: Beyond honey, there’s a wealth of value-added products derived from bee by-products, presenting additional avenues for development and revenue generation. Strategies for development of beekeeping in Northeast India To promote beekeeping as a significant and sustainable source of income for the rural poor, landless labourers, marginal farmers, and other disadvantaged groups, especially the poverty-stricken tribals in the Northeastern region, the following strategies can be implemented: y Encourage Organic Beekeeping: Provide support and incentives, including financial assistance, to established beekeepers to adopt organic beekeeping practices. y Establish Commercial-Scale Beekeeping: Identify and develop commercial-scale beekeeping operations in the most favourable and natural habitats within the region. y Develop a Systematic Marketing Network: Create a well-structured marketing network for organic honey and other hive products to facilitate their distribution and sale. y Raise Awareness through Media: Emphasize the significance of honey production through extensive coverage in print and electronic media to promote beekeeping. y Conduct Workshops: Organize specialized workshops dedicated to educating beekeepers on the methods and benefits of organic honey production. y Foster Collaboration: Promote collaboration and coordination among beekeepers and research and development organizations operating in the region. y Implement Buyback Policies: Initiate buyback policies through beekeeping cooperative societies and other honey trading organizations to ensure a fair and sustainable market for beekeepers.
