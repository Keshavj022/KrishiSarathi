 At the moment, the following new varieties have been developed and recommended for India’s North Western region, including Uttarakhand. Early varieties CoLk 11203 (Ikshu-5) This variety was released in 2018 under the early maturing group for cultivation in the North Western Zone of the country. It was developed by ICAR-IISR, Lucknow through selection from segregating population of biparental cross CoLk 8102 x Co 1148. The variety exhibited excellent performance with 18.41% sucrose during January (10 months) which qualifies for the early maturing character in this crop. The cane yield of this variety was 81.97 t/ha and 10.52 t/ha CCS yield. The features of variety are erect, medium thick canes and medium plant height. Ikshu-5 is a good ratooner, with an approximately 27% increase in cane yield over the standard check CoJ 64 in the ratoon crop. This is an added advantage as Indian Farming 4 November 2023 the ratoon crop constitutes around 50% of the total sugarcane acreage in the country. The variety is resistant to red rot and smut disease. This variety also showed the least susceptibility to the major pests like top borer, stalk borer and other borers. Overall, this variety is a good addition to the existing spectrum of sugarcane varieties for commercial cultivation in farmers’ fields in the north western zone of India. Co Pant 12221 Co Pant 12221 is an early maturing sugarcane variety that was developed by Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar from the progeny of general collection CoS8436GC collected from N.H.G., Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore. This variety exhibits high-sugared, high-yielding, non- lodging, disease resistance and is suitable for irrigated conditions. This variety has been released by SVRC in 2021 for cultivation in Uttarakhand. Co Pant 12221 has a higher sugar yield and cane yield per hectare with at par sugar content than checks CoJ 64 and Co 0238 along with moderate resistance against red rot and smut. Because of the heavy incidence of red rot in Co 0238, variety Co Pant 12221 is a good alternative for farmers. It has given 131.73 t/ha cane yield, 17.98 t/ha commercial cane sugar (CCS) yield and 17.84% sucrose content at 10 months. The variety has excellent field habits like erectness, smooth rind surface, absence of pithiness, and free from splits on the internode. Co 15023 (Karan-15) This variety has been developed by ICAR-SBI Regional Centre, Karnal (Haryana). It is an early maturing clone and was released by the CVRC in 2021 for North West Zone. The variety recorded 89.17 t/ha cane yield, 19.41% sucrose in juice and 12.16 t/ha CCS yield. This variety exhibited moderate resistance (MR) for red rot. CoS 13235 This variety has been developed by UP Council of Sugarcane Research, Shahjahanpur in the early maturing group and released in 2020 for North West Zone. It was developed by clonal selection from the cross MS 6487 and Co 1148. Average cane yield is 81-92 t/ha and 11.
