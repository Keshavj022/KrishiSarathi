 It provides information on Systematics, Common name, Synonyms, Biology, Length-Weight, Type specimen, Disease, Habitat, Distribution, Patent, Fish Nutrition and Bibliography. This system also serves as digital repository to hold information on different fish accessions preserved in different storage facilities like; live germplasm, cell lines and museum at ICAR-NBFGR, Lucknow. The system has link to Fish Base, WoRMS, CIFRI, CMFRI, FAO, NCBI, Google Patents and IUCN. The type specimen of each species has link to the different natural history museums of the world, which presents the holotype and other information. Additionally, it presents the molecular information from in-house molecular resources like HRGFish, FMiR, FBIS, Fish Karyome and Fish Microsat.
