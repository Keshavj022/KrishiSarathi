 Medicinal and aromatic plants: Seventy Indian neem accessions analysed with 21 random primers have revealed moderate genetic diversity among them. Plant Biotechnology A cell culture variant of rice IET 16768 has been promoted to Advanced Varietal Trial-stage II. Another promising double haploid rice (BTC-E23/99) has stood first in the Initial Evaluation Trial, showing yield advantage over checks. A novel vegetative insecticidal protein vip3A gene has been isolated and characterized at the molecular level. A protease inhibitor gene and a lectin gene have also been isolated from cowpea and characterized at the molecular level. The Bt transgenic rice using cry1Ac gene, developed earlier in IR 64 and Pusa Basmati backgrounds, tested in controlled conditions against yellow stem-borer has showed superior performance. A molecular breeding group has succeeded in developing a CAPS marker for Ac2 gene in mustard, cloning RGAs (resistance gene analogues) for Ac2 gene in mustard, extension of molecular map for mustard, using AFLP markers, and deployment of AFLP profiling system for non-aromatic rice, wheat and Brassica. RAPD profile of 23 chickpea germplasm accessions and cultivars Bt transgenic rice, using cry 1AC gene, developed earlier in IR 64 and Pusa Basmati backgrounds, when tested in controlled conditions against yellow stem-borer showed superior performance RICE GENOME SEQUENCING NRC on Plant Biotechnology is one of the centres to participate in a global endeavour to sequence Rice Genome. India has joined the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP), a global consortium, consisting of 11 countries, including US, Japan and China. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001â€“2002 16 FOOD CROPS RICE Crop Improvement In rice, 21 varieties and 2 hybrids have been released Pusa Sugandh 2 (IET 16310) and Pusa Sugandh 3 (IET 16313) are suitable for irrigated areas of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Uttaranchal.
