The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) joint activities with CGIAR Institutions in the areas of germplasm and technology exchange, capacity building etc. However, the changing climate and the human needs for food present newer and growing challenges of regular advancement of technologies and further to take them to the farmers. I am pleased to know that the ICAR is bringing out, for the first time, a document “ICAR-CGIAR Agricultural Cooperation”. The effort of summarizing the past achievements and identifying the future requirements of collaborative research is commendable for not only deepening of meaningful collaboration for strengthening food and nutrition security in India, but also in sharing our successes and knowledge with rest of the world, particularly, for bringing livelihood security through cooperation.
