 Including this satellite measure of the burned area greatly improves emissions estimates and minimizes error compared to typical approaches, which instead use an assumed fraction of total residues that are burned for each crop type. We estimated that emissions have increased by approximately 75 % for CO and Greenhouse gasses - CO2, CH4 and N2O - from 2011 to 2020. Total CO2e emissions increased from ~19,340 Gg.yr−1 in 2011 to ~33,834 Gg. yr−1 in 2020. Most emissions occurred during end of the Kharif season, followed by Rabi, caused by the burning * Corresponding author at: Dept.

Among the Indian states, Punjab has the highest burning activity, with 27 % (2.0 million hectares) of its total cultivated area burned in 2020. Interestingly, Madhya Pradesh has emerged as the second-largest contributor, accounting for 30 % of the total burned area across India in 2020. Our study dem­ onstrates how satellite data can be used to map agricultural residue burning at scale, and this information can provide crucial insights for policy framing, targeting, and interventions to manage agricultural residues without compromising air quality and climate. 1. Introduction With the successful dissemination of Green Revolution technologies, farmer access to modern inputs, and an amenable policy environment, the food grain production of India has almost tripled, from 115.60 million tonnes (Mt) in 1960–61 to 310.74 Mt in 2020–21 (Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, 2021; Kumar, 2016). However, current manage­ ment strategies for crop residue, the major byproduct of the agricultural sector, are deemed unsustainable and incompatible with this intensive production rate. Crop residue burning (CRB), is the most common way to manage the crop byproduct, and it is the fourth largest contributor to biomass burning emissions globally (Andreae and Merlet, 2001; Sahu et al., 2021). In India, around 87.0 Mt of crop residue is burned annually, which is much larger than the entire agricultural waste production in other Asian countries like Bangladesh (72.0 Mt), Indonesia (55.0 Mt), and Myanmar (19.0 Mt) (Bhuvaneshwari et al., 2019; Datta et al., 2020; NPMCR, 2014; TERI, 2021). India is the world's second-largest contributor to carbonaceous aerosols, emitting 84.0 Tg.yr−1 (Grover and Chaudhry, 2019).
