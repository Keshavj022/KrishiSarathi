 Draft studies undertaken on Ongole animals indicated that draught power of Ongole varied from 0.60 to 0.72 HP. Genetic improvement of Hariana cattle was initiated in collaboration with the CCS Haryana Agriculture University, Hisar (1989 to 2009). Hariana bullocks had capacity to pull moderate load of 8 quintals for about 2 hours without any serious effect on the physiological status. Indian Agriculture after Independence 144 Since 2010, genetic improvements of Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal breeds in their home tracts have been undertaken in IBP in collaboration with State Agricultural/Veterinary Universities and ICAR institutes. About 16500 Gir, 10500 Kankrej and 3400 Sahiwal cows from the farmers/Organized herds have been covered under the project and 5490, 2743 and 1003 improved female calves of respective breeds were produced. The elite females had average lactation yield of 3238, 3553 and 3393 kg in Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal, respectively showing overall improvements in respective breeds as 36.73, 24.33 and 20.02%, during 2010 to 2020. In 2018, ICAR-CIRC established a herd of Frieswal cow by selecting elite Frieswal cows as bull mother farm for the production of young male calves for testing in the Field Progeny Testing (FPT) Programme at four different centres with coordinating unit at CIRC, Meerut. The young bulls are reared at Bull Rearing Unit at Meerut for collection, storage and distribution of semen. The ranked bull semen was also used at the bull mother farm maintained at ICAR-NDRI, Karnal for the production of young bulls. The Field Progeny Testing programme resulted in an increase of average first lactation 305 days milk yield of the Frieswal progenies by 67.76% in KVASU, 41.95% in GADVASU, 12.41% in BAIF and 36.07% in GBPUA&T unit. 4.2. Buffalo Network Project on Buffalo Improvement (NPBI) was started by ICAR in the year 1993 with ICAR-CIRB Hisar as the coordinating unit. The main aim of this project was to ensure the sustained maintenance of nucleus herds as bull mother units and production of improved germplasm on large scale for use in buffalo improvement program by establishing linkages with institutions. Important breeds of buffaloes viz. Murrah, Nili-Ravi, Bhadawari, Jaffarabadi, Surti, Pandharpuri and Godavari were included under NPBI programme for their genetic improvement. The elite herd of breedable Murrah, Nili-Ravi, Jaffarabadi, Bhadawari, and Surti buffaloes along with semen freezing laboratories were established under NPBI for the production of genetically superior young bulls of these breeds. High genetic merit male and female calves of Murrah breed are being used for production of future elite parents at ICAR-CIRB, Hisar. So far, 19 sets of Murrah bulls had been tested under the NPBI. The performance of the nucleus herd has increased from 1820 kg/lactation in 1993 to 2586 kg in 2020 (42% increase). A total of 33 progeny tested bulls have been produced under the project with highest genetic superiority of 18.75%.
