A total of 18,601 accessions characterized and evaluated were of wheat and rice for terminal heat and drought tolerance; 4,163 accessions were supplied for research and crop improvement within the country. Phytochemical characterization enabled identification of promising genotypes such as three varieties of ricebean [Palam Rajmung l; RBHP 43 rich in protein Variability (a) in fruits of snake-gourd; (b) panicles of sorghum; (c) fruits of kalingada (a) (b) (c) Rice genotypes tolerant to biotic and abiotic stresses Stress Resistant/moderately resistant accessions Abiotic Heat DRRH 106, DRRH 107, IET 24075, Somali, IET 23979, IET 24082 Drought IET 25108, IET 24679, Narendra 97, IET 25134, IET 25141, IET 25104 Cold (seedling stage) RP 5434 RAU 26-4, RP 5433 RAU 27-17 and RP 5433 RAU-19-2 Salinity IET 23216, Somali, IR 8-2635 B-B 347-1, IET 24674 Biotic Leaf blast IC 211168, Punshi, Moirang-Phou-khokngangbi, Thangjing-Phou Brown spot IC 211168, IC 217196 Sheath blight SM 801, Ngonolasha, Wazuho Phek, Gumdhan, BG 380-2, RP 2068-18-3-5, Phougak, Thangmoi Brown plant hopper PTB 33, RP 2068, T 12, IC 216750 Root-knot nematode LD 24, Khao Pahk Maw Gall midge RP 5588 B-B-B- 32, Aganni White-backed plant hopper AC 34222, AC 34264, AC 38468, AC 42425 Promising wheat genotypes identified for different value-added products Product Genotype Chapati (>8.0/10.0) K 1317, HI 1605, HD 2888, C 306, K 8027, MACS 6478, HD 2932, NIAW 1415 Bread (>575ml loaf volume) HI 1605, MACS 6222, MACS 6478, HD 2932, Raj 4083, NI 5439, NIAW 1415, DBW 93 Biscuit (>10 spread factor) HS 490 Pasta (>7.0/9.0) HI 8759, MACS 3949, MPO 1215, UAS 446 Extraction rate (%) K 1317, HI 1605, HD 2888, C 306, K 8027, NI 5439, NIAW 1415 DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 22 GENETIC RESOURCES DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 23 Registered germplasm Crop National identity INGR No Novel unique features Rice(Oryza sativa) IC0390780 15037 Spikelets with long sterile glumes.
