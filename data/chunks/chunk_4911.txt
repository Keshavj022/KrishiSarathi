 According to the reports of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), Narsingh Lal, a farmer from Biaorakala village (Khilchipur block, Rajgarh District) in Madhya Pradesh, highlighted the advantages of this approach, stating that while previous verbal explanations by NGOs or government officials were useful, the videos provided a clearer understanding of the entire farming process by visually showcasing it on the field. This participatory video approach not only made it easier for farmers to comprehend and retain information but also overcame limitations in traditional extension systems, such as the lack of frequent interaction and local facilitation. Digital Green has shown that involving communities in a participatory process, coupled with straightforward technology solutions, empowers small-scale farmers to create and share knowledge on best agricultural practices for enhanced productivity and sustainable livelihoods. Early pilot studies demonstrated not only higher adoption rates through the video-based approach but also confirmed that Digital Green’s model is more cost-efficient than traditional agricultural extension methods. Success Story 3: Amplifying farmers’ voices and knowledge sharing via community radio Community radio is a grassroots broadcasting medium tailored to serve the unique needs of rural and marginalized communities. By operating in local languages and dialects, it enables individuals to access essential information on agriculture, health, education, and local events. This platform not only promotes knowledge-sharing but also fosters community involvement and empowerment, allowing listeners to participate actively by voicing their concerns, sharing success stories, and receiving timely, relevant advice. In areas with limited internet or mobile connectivity, community radio remains a vital tool for inclusive, accessible communication and social development. The success of community radio is evident from the data, which highlights its effectiveness in delivering information, improving knowledge, and satisfying the diverse needs of rural listeners. In a study of listeners’ perceived effectiveness, it was observed that 39.99% of listeners rated community radio as highly effective in providing agricultural advisories, with an overall mean effectiveness score of 0.519 (Table 4). It highlights the power of community radio in reaching remote farmers with practical information. However, 22.22% listeners found it moderately effective, indicating room for enhancing the relevance and frequency of content. This strong perceived effectiveness correlates with community radio’s ability to engage listeners through familiar, relatable content. Table 4.
