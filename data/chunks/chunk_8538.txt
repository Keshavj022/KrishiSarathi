 Evaluation of extracts of various plants indicated that methanol and hexane extracts of Annona squamosa seeds were the most promising resulting in complete deterrence of feeding activity of pollu beetle at 1% concentration. The management of root mealybug Planococcus sp. on black pepper at Wynad (Kerala) indicated that drenching of affected vines with chlorpyriphos (0.075%) was effective. A low-cost technology for mass multiplication of Trichoderma sp. for field application was developed. Rhizome rot of ginger under storage could be managed by storing seed rhizomes of ginger in sand layered pits mixed with Dithane M 45 and Bavistin. Coriander, RCr 441, RCr 435, RCr 436, UD 446 and UD 684, were resistant to root-knot nematode. Sowing cumin on 10 November was ideal to minimize wilt incidence and to obtain a high yield. Guj. Cum.3, Acc. 1136, Acc. 1145 and Acc. 1165 were moderately resistant to Fusarium wilt. Surveys conducted in tradersâ€™ godowns at Calicut and Kochi indicated that Lasioderma serricorne, Rhizopertha dominica, Tribolium castaneum, Araecerus fasciculatus and Tenebroides mauritanicus were major species of insects associated with stored dry rhizomes of ginger and turmeric. BETELVINE Vasani Kapoori at Bapatla, Shirpurkata at Sangli and Dindugal at Sirugamani yielded highest leaf compared to local checks. Yield increase was in the tune of 54.0, 30.8, and 45.0% respectively at Bapatla, Sangli and Sirugamani centres. About 100% replenishment of pan evaporation rate through drip irrigation produced highest leaf yield (25.55 lakh/ha) at Jabalpur. However at Sangli centre, 125% evaporation replenishment produced highest yield (42.32 lakh/ha) with a water saving of 34.26%. At Jabalpur centre, 1.5 lakh plants/ha population was found to be the best with increased leaf yield (15.80 lakh/ha). At Bhubaneswar, 2.00 lakh plants/ha gave highest leaf yield. At Pusa center, 1.50 lakh plants/ha yielded maximum number of leaves (37.51 lakh/ha). Disease incidence increased with increase in population. Under open system of cultivation, 1.0 lakh plants/ha produced maximum leaf yield at Bapatla (57.17 lakh/ha), 50,000 at Sangli (71.11 lakh/ha) and 75,000 at Sirugamani (41.83 lakh/ha). At Kalyani, Azotobacter 5 kg + 100 kg P2O5 + 100 kg K2O treatment produced highest leaf yield (41.56 lakh/ha). At Sirugamani, Azospirillum 5 kg + 100 kg P2O5 + 100 kg K2O + Azotobacter treatment was the second highest yielder (70.22 lakh/ha) after recommended fertilizer dose. In integrated crop management, integration of following treatments such as best plant population/ha, 200 kg N + 100 kg P2O5 + 100 kg K2O, watering 100% replenishment of PER and application of Bordeaux mixture (4 drenches + 8 sprays) produced highest leaf yield at Bapatla, Kalyani, Jabalpur and Bhubaneswar centres. Four applications of Trichoderma spp. was found to increase higher leaf yield.
