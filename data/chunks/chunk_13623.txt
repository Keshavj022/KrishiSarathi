 Here only one dominant type of water was observed, namely Ca–HCO3 type (73.68%) and both mixed Ca–Mg–Cl type (21%) and mixed Ca–Mg–HCO3 type (5.26%) covered only one sample locations each. During PRM season, 36.84% sampled water falls under no dominant type, 47.36% locations fall under magnesium type and 15.78% locations fall under sodium type in cations. In anion type, 36.84% stations showed no dominant types and the rest 52.63% and 10.52% of stations were Fig. 2. (continued). R. Anjum et al. Chemical Engineering Journal Advances 16 (2023) 100547 8 grouped into bicarbonate type and chloride type of water. Because the flow is high, not much time will be left there for percolation [43]. The predominance of Mg and Ca in the groundwater samples obtained from the high topography advocates an inverse ion exchange method [45]. During this procedure, Ca from the Aquifer matrix was swapped by Na from the groundwater. Nonetheless, water is ruled by the Na and Cl ions Fig. 3.

Sluggish surface runoff in these moderately flat areas allows adequate rock-water interactions [45]. The data slightly differs in POM season. Here 47.36% locations showed no dominant type of water. However, 42.10% of locations were covered in magnesium dominance and 5.26% in sodium dominance. In cations, 78.94% of stations fall in bicarbonate type water quality and 21% showed no dominant type of water quality. Assessment of the water type using piper plot proposes that there is a clear sign of the influence from the weathering in the hard rocks along with some alteration from the mixing of water from anthropogenic sources [47]. There are plenty of cases of dumping industrial effluents into the ground via unused boreholes and the seepage of sewerage from a faulty drainage system [48]. During POM season, the data showed the concentration of more than one type of facies juxtapose to PRM season. This change can be the Fig. 3. (continued). R. Anjum et al.

The physico-chemical composition of groundwater is navigated by various stimuli which include the aquifer or catchment area, the mineralogy of the rock types, existing overlying land cover, ground­ water recharge sources, soil types etc. [43–46]. The amount of oxygen decreases with the increasing gap from the surface.
