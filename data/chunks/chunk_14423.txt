 CRB activities are the primary source of partic­ ulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), black carbon (BC), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during the pre- and post-monsoon crop harvest (Grover and Chaudhry, 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2019). These emissions increase the risk of acute respiratory infection and other correlated diseases and deteriorate the living standards of agrarian states and their surrounding regions (Bikkina et al., 2019; Chakrabarti et al., 2019; Jethva et al., 2019; Ravindra et al., 2019). Recently, CRB was found to exacerbate negative health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (Chauhan et al., 2023). CRB is a popular, cost-effective way for farmers to control weeds and pests, clear residues, and release nutrients back into the soil (Junpen et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020; McCarty et al., 2009). Multiple crop cycles, mechanized harvesting and the absence of cost-effective residue removal solutions have fuelled CRB despite the Indian government's multilevel attempts to curb these activities (Deshpande et al., 2022a; Liu et al., 2021). Rice-wheat systems are the major contributors to CRB, followed by sugarcane, maize, jute and cotton (Jain et al., 2014; Sahu et al., 2021). Many studies have reported crop residue burning and related emissions in prominent agrarian regions of India, primarily for residues generated during the Kharif cropping season (June–November). Extensive research has been carried out to comprehend how CRB con­ tributes to the seasonal deterioration of air quality in northern India across the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) (Badarinath et al., 2006; Bikkina et al., 2019; Chakrabarti et al., 2019; Jethva et al., 2019; Kaskaoutis et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2018; Ravindra et al., 2019; Singh and Kaskaoutis, 2014; Vellalassery et al., 2021; Vijayakumar et al., 2016). However, only a few studies have been conducted to assess the CRB potential in non- IGP states, focusing mainly on the central Indian region (Deshpande et al., 2022a; Verma et al., 2019). The spatiotemporal resolution of existing crop statistics limits our understanding of factors influencing CRB, ultimately limiting mitigation efforts. This is because most studies have been conducted at the state scale and typically for only one year. For example, Sahai et al. (2011) presented CRB emissions for each Indian state for 1994, 2000, and 2005. Subsequently, Jain et al. (2014) estimated agricultural emissions for 2008–2009, while Sahu et al. (2021) provided estimates for 2018. A second limitation is that estimates of emissions in these studies are driven by agricultural production statistics, and CRB and GHG emissions are largely estimated by assuming that a certain fixed fraction of resi­ dues are burned for all crops (e.g. FAOSTAT estimates).
