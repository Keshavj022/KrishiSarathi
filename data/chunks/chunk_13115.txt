 Males have several black pin-head size black spots below the lateral line and small-sized anal papilla.  Captive spawning is undertaken in shallow concrete/FRP tanks with water depth 15-20 cm, where aquatic weed like Hydrilla is uniformly spread. 4-6 pairs of female and male brooders (1:2 ratio) are kept in tank of 6-8 feet diameter and given hormonal injections of Ovaprim/ Ovatide @ 0.5 ml/kg to female and 0.3 ml/kg to male.  Fish spawn between 12-36 h and lay 500-1,000 eggs per female at one place between aquatic weeds, from where they are scooped out and transferred to the hatching tanks.  Eggs are spherical, non-adhesive, free floating and light yellow in colour and hatch in 24-26 h with 90-95% fertilization.  The larvae are fed from 4th day onwards with Artemia nauplii/small-size plankton 3-4 times in a day for 15 days. Larvae are fed with egg custard ad libitum from 15th day onwards till one month, which grow to about 15-20 mm in size with 50-60% survival.  Fry rearing is undertaken in outdoor tanks, fed with aquatic insects, tubifex and chopped earthworms; powdered fish meal and soya flour (3:1) @ 5-10% of their body weight twice a day in addition to live feed. With removal of shooters, a survival of 30-35% is achieved.  The technology has been extended to West Bengal, Odisha, Assam and Uttar Pradesh. 34 Chital Chitala chitala (Hamilton 1822)  Chital inhabits freshwaters, particularly the large rivers of north and central India, countries of Indian sub-continent and south-east Asia.  The fish breed in flowing rivers, and also in captive pond condition in presence of appropriate habitat, viz., hard substratum, earthen pots, plastic pipes etc. during monsoon months.  Sexes are separate and mature females have bulged abdomen and fleshy but blunt urinogenital papilla. Males are slender and having thin, conical and pointed anal papilla.  Induced breeding is undertaken through hormonal intervention, with injection of Ovaprim/ Wova-FH/Ovatide @ 1 ml/kg body weight for female and 0.5 mg/kg male.  Fully mature female and male in ratio of 1:2 after hormonal injection are released in large tanks where earthen rings or plastic pipes are provided for attachment of eggs.  Spawning occurs after 14-15 h. The fertilized eggs are deposited inside and outside the earthen rings or all around the pipes, and remain deeply attached due to adhesive nature.  Eggs were milky white in colour at the beginning, which further turns to light yellowish, yellow orange and finally bright orange red in colour within 6-7 days.  Hatching takes 168-192 h. Yolk-sac is absorbed in 12-14 days. The hatchlings are light brownish in colour and bearing blood capillaries.  Rearing in re-circulatory system on live tubifex, daphnia and boiled egg yolk gives 80% survival at fry stage in a period of 60 days.  The seed production technology is mainly adopted in West Bengal, Assam and Odisha.
