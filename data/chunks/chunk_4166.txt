 However, once these challenges are overcome, food processing and nutraceuticals development are very rewarding industries in terms of growth, profit, easy product storage, easy availability of raw material and labour, increasing demand due to change in consumers perception, employment generation, industry development and drastic reduction in losses and waste. Most significantly, it helps us to become sustainable while attempting to reach the goals of food and nutritional security for all. Wealth from vegetable wastes As per the research report (2011) of National Institute of Agricultural Marketing, Jaipur, conducted across the Diversified processed products from vegetables Okra Fenugreek Cauliflower Bitter gourd chips Moringa soup Moringa drink Green chilli powder Marchâ€“April 2023 105 Table 1.

Wastage in vegetables ranged from 3.15% to 12.6%. Majority of the wastes generated in the APMCs are disposed-off as garbage. Vegetable waste from market and homes are source of environmental pollution, and human health hazards. Besides, the entire volume of food waste is unutilized and results in food loss and hence economic loss. Recycling of fruit and vegetable waste is one of the most important means of utilizing it in a number of innovative ways yielding new products and meeting the requirements of essential products required in human, animal and plant nutrition as well as in the pharmaceutical industry. Agricultural wastes may be used as a source of energy, bedding, animal feed, mulch, organic matter, or plant nutrients. Properly treated, they can be marketable. Futuristic concept is to generate electricity from these bio-wastes. This is a cleaner, greener and economical method of power generation. Microbial technology is available for recycling and processing of fruit and vegetables waste. These could be utilized for production of compost for use in crops.
