 Native chickens (Aseel, Ghagus and Nicobari) were conserved and PD- 4 (Improved Aseel) is being improved for body weight and egg production. In PD-4 line, body weight improved by 12 g and shank length 1.33 mm at 8 weeks of age in S-6 generation. Duroc, another exotic germplasm, was crossed with Rani to develop Asha variety having 25% Ghungroo, 25% Hampshire and 50% Duroc inheritance. Asha can attain 80 kg body weight at slaughter age of 8 months with 1.75 cm back fat thickness. Poultry Broilers: The overall average of body weight at 5 weeks in Synthetic Dam Line (SDL) was 1,152.84±2.44g. The average hen housed egg production up to 40 and 52 weeks of age were 65.4 and 108.2 eggs. Egg weight at 40 and 52 weeks were 65.24±1.50 and 62.36±0.77 g, respectively. The age at first egg in Coloured Synthetic Female Line (CSFL) was 179.30 days. Average hen housed egg production up to 40 weeks and 52 weeks were 65.8 and 109.9 eggs/bird. Layer: The reproductive performance (measured as fertility percentage) of selected strain of Rhode Island Red (RIRs) and the control population (RIRc) for 32nd generation was in the range of 83.6 to 86.9% and 86.0 to 87.8%, respectively. The RIRs females recorded a significantly higher 40th week egg production (51.3 eggs) and egg weight (1.90 g), accompanied with lower age at the first egg (by 39.0 day) as compared to RIRc. Immuno-competence and microsatellite profiling in RIR: Results revealed significant effect of ADL0328 microsatellite-genotypes on chick weight and body weight at 2 and 28 weeks of age; LEI0068 genotypes on body weight at 28 week of age; LEI0071 genotypes on chick weight and body weight at 28 weeks of age; MCW0010 genotypes on body weight at 16, 32, 36 Two new and improved crossbred varieties of pigs namely Rani (left) and Asha (right) were released Ankleshwar (AN) Nicobari (NC) CARI RED (CR) NC×CR Nicobari female bird Nicobari male bird Under the conservation programme, Aseel birds were characterized phenotypically as multi colour plumage type (predominantly dark brown, black, golden etc.) with solid feather pattern and normal distribution, pea comb (98%) with dark red colour (82%). In native pure Aseel, the body weight at 6, 12 and 16 weeks was 313.7, 857.3 and 1,312.2 g, respectively, with corresponding shank lengths of 72.3, 97.8 and 110.8 mm. The annual egg production up to 72 weeks of age was 64.4 eggs during the G2 generation. All India Coordinated Research Project on Poultry Breeding: Under AICRP on poultry breeding, all the centres are working for the development of location specific rural poultry variety utilizing the local native chicken germplasm in addition to the conservation of elite layer and broiler lines. The KVASU, Mannuthy centre evaluated S-0 generation of native chicken germplasm. The egg production of native chicken germplasm up to 40 weeks of age was 69.8 eggs with an average egg weight of 43.6 g.
