 • An alternate model for in vivo protection studies for FMD, virus neutralization test (VNT)-based statistical model was developed for serotype O. Its testing in two different laboratories showed accuracy ranging from 72.4 to 79.7%. Liquid Phase Blocking ELISA (LPBE) based statistical model developed for serotype O showed accuracy of 85.4%. • A sandwich, ELISA based technique was developed for quantification of Newcastle disease virus in the vaccine formulation; the diagnostic specificity was 100% and diagnostic sensitivity 95%. • A multiplex PCR (m-PCR) based kit for detection of four extraneous agents MDV, EDSV, CIAV, and avian mycoplasma in poultry as well as cell lines of avian origin were developed. The kit was stable up to one year at 4°C and –20°C. • An indirect-ELISA based on the recombinant E2 protein of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) was developed for detection of CSFV antibody in the serum samples. Relative diagnostic sensitivity was 85% and specificity 92%. • A multiplex PCR assay was developed for accurate diagnosis of haemoparasitic diseases, viz. Babesia vogeli, B. gibsoni, Hepatozoon canis and Ehrlichia canis. Characterization of pathogens • ESBL producing K. pneumoniae isolates carried the genetic platform- ISEcp1-blaCTX-M-orf477. A new variant of blaCTX-M was detected in an isolate from Jharkhand. • Overall occurrence of ESBL producing E. coli and Klebsiella spp. in bovine milk from Asom and Haryana were 13.28 and 9.67%, respectively. • Of the 623 E. coli isolates from neonatal calves, 341 (54.73%) were pathogenic. EPEC was the predominant pathotype (26.16%), followed by STEC (14.12%), EHEC (10.27%), ETEC (3.04%) and EAEC (1.12%). • Prevalence of Clostridium perfringens was 37.97% (259/682) in neonatal calves. The type A was the most predominant with a prevalence rate of 59.45%. • Among the ESBL genotypic positive E. coli isolates, BlaCTX-M was the most prominent gene (456/525), followed by blaAMPC (391/525), blaTEM (311/525) and blaSHV (28/525). Carbapenem resistance was observed in 129 (21.39%) E. coli isolates. • Silencing of Ferritin-2 (FER2) and Tropomyosin (TPM) genes of Haemolytica anatolicum had significant effects on feeding and fecundity of ticks. • IVRI-IV tick line, the first established deltamethrin and cypermethrin resistant tick line of India, was registered in the national registration system (NBAIR-IVRI-BM-4-2009). • Country specific multiple mechanisms conferring resistance in R. (B.) microplus isolates against synthetic pyrethroid (SP) and organophosphate (OP) compounds was established. • The sequence information of Malassezia pacchydermatis (animal source) from India submitted first time in NCBI database. Clinical and surgical interventions Composite scaffolds for bone and tendon repair: Bone and tendon biomaterials were prepared for the healing of the lost bone and tendon tissues through use of tissue engineering techniques.
