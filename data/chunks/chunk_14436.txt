 However, we observed that the ABA of Uttar Pradesh is only 1 % (0.20 million ha) of its total cultivation area (18.20 million ha in 2011 and 18.8 million ha in 2020), suggesting that burning of resi­ dues in Uttar Pradesh only plays a minor role in contributing to India's overall emissions. Instead, Punjab appears to be the biggest contributor to emissions, where the percentage of ABA increased from 22 % (1.40 million ha) to 27 % (2.00 million ha) over our study period. There are two possible reasons that explain why the amount of residue burning is low in Uttar Pradesh compared to Punjab - differences in rice varieties and the number of livestock that farmers own. These factors lead to differences in residue management practices in the eastern states of the IGP, such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, compared to those in the north-western states of the IGP, such as Punjab and Haryana. In the north-western states, more farmers plant non-Basmati (coarse) rice, and the rice residues from these varieties are generally considered unfit for animal consumption due to high silica and oxalate content, resulting in large-scale residue burning (Dutta et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2007; Ven­ kataraman et al., 2006). Furthermore, there is greater livestock popu­ lation in the eastern IGP and rice straw form a major cattle feed in the northeast compared to the northwest IGP (Erenstein and Thorpe, 2011). West Bengal has the highest cattle population (19.0 M), followed by Uttar Pradesh (18.80 M) and Bihar (15.30 M), while Punjab (2.20 M) and Haryana (1.20 M) have the lowest cattle population among the IGP states (Livestock Census, 2019).

Science of the Total Environment 904 (2023) 166944 11 the cattle population and rice residue produced for 2019, with Punjab having the lowest cattle-to-rice residue ratio while Bihar having the highest ratio. These patterns, however, cannot fully explain the het­ erogeneity in ABA across the IGP. For example, there is a high level of ABA in rice-dominant districts of West Bengal and Bihar, despite having a sizable cattle population. More work is needed to understand the so­ cial, market, and behavioural factors behind the burning decisions. Most academic and media attention focuses on residue burning in the IGP states, especially from the north-western states such as Punjab (Jain et al., 2014; Reddy et al., 2002; Sahai et al., 2011; Sahu et al., 2021; Venkataraman et al., 2006). Our study, however, highlights the increasing and significant contribution to residue burning from the non- IGP states.
