 Sprouting under controlled conditions Experiments with various conditions of organisms, isolated from cowdung; unsterilized and sterilized cowdung were conducted to study its effect on sprouting behaviour. Three replications were used with 36 tubers in each replication. The microorganisms were inoculated with the spore concentration of 2x 106 forming units (CFU) per liter. The isolates were identified at the Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh. Biochemical changes occurring during sprouting with relation to phenol, reducing sugar, total sugar and protein were assessed following standard methods. Post-harvest tuber rot Dioscorea (yam) tubers were subjected to storage and natural rotting. The rotted tubers were planted in petri plates on potato dextrose agar medium under aseptic conditions. The causal organisms were transplanted to PDA slants. The cultures were again plated and re-isolated. The pathogenicity of rotting organisms was confirmed by inoculation on healthy tubers, for identical symptoms. Soil samples were also subjected to serial dilution agar planting to detect the presence of rotting pathogens. One antagonistic experiment was conducted in order to study the inhibitory effect of bacteria and actinomycetes, isolated from the cow dung, against rotting pathogens. The test organisms were inoculated alongwith the individual rotting fungus in PDA petri dishes. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Sprouting of yam setts was higher when treated with fresh cowdung slurry under both on-farm (100%) and research station (92%) situations (Table 1). In contrast, the application of Bavistin + ash resulted in sprouting of 78% and 84% under on- Table 1.

Sprouting of all the 36 setts was achieved in 35 days when the setts were treated with fresh cowdung slurry, which was 97% with chemical method (Table 2). About 81% setts were sprouted in 35 days when no treatment was imposed. Yield Early sprouting, facilitated by application of fresh cowdung slurry, resulted in obtaining higher yield of tubers both at research station and at farmers' fields (Table 3). Higher yield was, however, obtained under on- farm conditions. Yield of the setts treated with Bavistin was similar to that obtained without any Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Table 2.
