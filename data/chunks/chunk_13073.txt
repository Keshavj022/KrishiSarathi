 Emphasis in the assessment will be on the contributions and achievements of the individuals in relation to the requirements of the job and duties assigned to the scientists during the period of assessment. An assessment system serves more than the obvious function of rewarding scientists by promotion or advance increments. It helps the individuals to identify and develop those aspects of their personality and performance on which the organisation they work for lays emphasis. This in turn helps the organisation to evolve a working culture appropriate to its mandate and acquire expertise which would be best suited to meet its goals. An appropriate assessment and career advancement system can thus act as a catalyst for achieving the results for which the organisation is supported from public funds.
