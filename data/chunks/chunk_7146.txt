 It collects the straw from combine harvested rice field. Working width of implement is 1,067 mm. In a single pass, it can collect 5â€“8 kg straw from harvested field. Field capacity of the implement was 0.18 ha/h. Bullock power sunflower thresher A bullock power, rotary mode driven feed type sunflower thresher was developed. The average output of the thresher was 65 kg/h with efficiency of threshing as 99% and cleaning 85%. The speed of rotation of the thresher shaft (430 rpm), oscillating screen shaft (360 rpm) and blower shaft (270 rpm) is maintained with the bullocks moving at 1.9 km/h. The overall fatigue score of the bullocks was 13.5 after 1 h continuous operation, indicating that the equipment could be operated comfortably by them. The average power requirement for threshing was 0.29 kW. The average output of the thresher was 64.8 kg/h with efficiency of threshing as 98.7% and cleaning 84.5% respectively. The cost of sunflower threshing is ` 5.30/kg as compared to `10.40/ kg with conventional method. Total mixed ration (TMR) mixing machine for animal feed Total mix ration machine was developed for mixing animal feed. For preparing TMR mixture 60% wheat straw and 40% concentrates were taken. The composition of the concentrate was mineral mixture 2%, de-oiled rice bran 30%, wheat/barley 35%, gram churi 17%, groundnut cake 15% and 1% salt. Capacity of TMR machine was 25 kg. Mixing time of 10 min was the best for obtaining uniform TMR mixture. Variation in feed nutritive value within the batch was less than 6%; hence, the ingredients are mixed uniformly. Bio-methane generation from urea pre-treated baled paddy straw A process for the bio-methanation of baled paddy straw was developed without the energy intensive operations (chopping, grinding, chemical/microbial pre- treatment, etc.). The process includes on-field pre- treatment of straw bales with urea solution followed by anaerobic digestion without any size reduction and Solar assisted e-prime mover for weeding and spraying in soybean crop A solar assisted e-prime mover was developed and its field performance in spraying and weeding (horizontal rotor) was conducted. The speed of operation for horizontal rotary weeding and spraying was 1.3 km/h and 2.6 km/h, respectively. The weeding efficiency, field capacity and power requirement for weeding was 70%, 0.06 ha/h and 550 W, respectively. Similarly, the field capacity and power requirement for boom sprayer was 0.52 ha/h and 50 W, respectively. separate pre-treatment. The urea treatment intervened to achieve the C:N ratio of substrate in the range of 20:1 to 30:1. The urea pre-treated straw bales was co- digested with cow dung in the proportion of 50:50 (wb). The dry matter of substrate maintained at 10% (db) by addition of water. The biogas production was 458 l/kg of total substrate (db) which is 11% higher than the chopped untreated paddy straw co-digested with cow dung.
