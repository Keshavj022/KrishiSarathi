 Improved Varieties There are two type varieties in Bajra crop (Composite & Hybrid) with a large variation in maturity period (from 60 days to 100 days maturity period). Selection of variety should be done very carefully, for example under early onset of monsoon, long duration composite varieties should be cultivated and under late onset of monsoon extra short duration varieties should be grown. Important varieties are as follows: Composites: Raj-171, CZP-9802, MBC-2 (Maturity Period- 90 to 100 days) 48 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS Hybrids: HHB-67, HHB-67 improved, RHB-121, RHB-173, RHB-154, RHB-177, MPMH-117 (Maturity Period- 65 to 75 days) Seed Rate Pearl millet require 4-5 kg of seed per ha for getting optimum plant population Plant protection Termite & White grub are serious pest in Bajra crop, therefore, apply Fipronil 0.3G@ 12 kg/ha with seed at the time of sowing for its effective control. Green gram It is a major kharif pulse crop & cultivated with the onset of monsoon. Improved Varieties: IPM-02-3, IPM-02-14, MH-421, MH-2-15, MH- 1142, SML-668, GM-4, GM-5, IPM-409-4, IPM-312-20. Seed Rate: 12-15 kg is recommended for one ha area. Cowpea: Short duration crop, mature in 60-70 days only & highly drought tolerant sown on onset of monsoon. Improved Varieties: There are very limited improved varieties available for its commercial cultivation. 1. RC-19 (Brown seeded) & 2. RC-101 (White seeded) Seed Rate: To get the optimum plant stand 12-15 kg seed per ha is recommended. Moth bean: It is also a highly drought tolerant, short duration pulse crop of Kharif season & mostly cultivated in north western arid districts of the Rajasthan state & it prefers sandy soil with good drainage conditions. It 49 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS also matures in 60-70 days. Sown on onset of monsoon. Improved Varieties: RMO-257, RMO-225, RMO-435, RMO-423, RMO-2251, RMB-25, CZM-2. Seed Rate: To get the optimum pant population 10-12 kg seed per ha is sufficient. Cluster bean (Guar): It is also a drought tolerant kharif season leguminous crop and cultivated with the onset of monsoon. Improved Varieties: There are two type of varieties in guar crop-(i) Tall and single stem without branching: RGC-197 & RGC-1066, and (ii) Dwarf & branching type: RGC,1017, RGC-1031, RGC-1038, RGC-1055, RGC-1033, HG- 2-20, HG-563 etc.Comparatively dwarf & branching type varieties are short duration & highly drought tolerant than single stem varieties. Seed Rate: Improved varieties seeds of 12-15 kg are sown per ha. Sesame (Til): Sowing should be started with the onset of monsoon & must be completed before mid-July.This crop is highly sensitive to water logging conditions; therefore, proper drainage facilities are must for higher productivity. Improved Varieties: The improved varieties are RT-46, RT-125, RT-127, RT-346, RT-351 etc. These varieties mature in about 75-85 days. Seed Rate: Seed rate of 2-2.5 kg per ha with plant geometry of 45cm x10cm.
