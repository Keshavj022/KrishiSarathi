 • pH control of the solution: All of the minerals are contained in the water. That means one can measure and adjust water mixture’s pH levels more quickly than the soil. That ensures optimal nutrient uptake for plants. Indian Farming 10 September 2023 • Better growth rate: Hydroponically, plants grow faster than in soil if plants are placed in ideal conditions, while nutrients are provided in sufficient amounts, and come into direct contact with the root systems. Plants no longer waste valuable energy searching for diluted nutrients in the soil. Instead, they shift all of their focus to growing and producing fruits. • Fewer pests and diseases: Like weeds, getting rid of soils helps make your plants less vulnerable to soil-borne problems like birds, gophers, and groundhogs; and illnesses like Fusarium, Pythium, and Rhizoctonia species. Also, gardeners can easily control most surrounding variables when growing indoors in a closed system. • Labour and time savers: Besides spending less on tilling, watering, cultivating, and fumigating weeds and pests, when agriculture is planned to be more technology-based, human intervention can be minimized to a considerable extent. Way forward Hydroponics emerges as a promising solution within the scope of Indian agriculture, providing a viable pathway to address a range of complex agricultural challenges, including water scarcity, limited arable land availability, and unpredictable climatic conditions. This comprehensive explanation outlines a systematic approach towards adopting and advancing hydroponic techniques in the Indian context, emphasizing the integration of data-driven approaches. This can be accomplished through extensive education and training in hydroponics, involving a deep understanding of various hydroponic systems along with an assessment of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Thorough exploration of suitable crops for hydroponic cultivation in the Indian climate is essential. By analyzing relevant local climatic data, such as temperature, humidity, and water availability, it is possible to customize hydroponic setups and nutrient formulations to align with indigenous conditions. Viable options like the Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), Deep Water Culture (DWC), and Vertical Farming warrant careful evaluation. When finalizing the chosen hydroponic configuration, it’s crucial to ensure compatibility with available resources, including budgetary considerations, spatial limitations, and labour capacities. Employ state-of-the-art sensor technologies and Internet of Things (IoT) devices for real-time data collection, and implement a well- planned crop rotation strategy to prevent soil-related issues and maintain a balanced nutrient environment in the hydroponic setup. In addition, integrating market and business strategies is vital to capitalize on the demand for locally produced hydroponic crops.
