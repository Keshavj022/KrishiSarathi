 The re- search involves the examination of biophysical components such as soil qualities, satellite imagery-based indices, meteorological con- ditions, and so on. To identify LSA groups, soil samples were col- lected from well-distributed locations across the study area and examined for Physico-chemical parameters such as soil pH, and soil N-P-K. In addition, remote sensing data were used to estab- lish the land use/ land cover groups, Geomorphology, and LAND- SAT OLI/TIRS images with a 30-m spatial resolution. The satel- lite imagery bands were compiled, fused, and layered using open- source image processing techniques. All these parameters were subjected to a conventional coordination system, and projection and weighted overlay analysis (WOA) was done. • Satellite data: Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS with 30 m resolution (2021 year), attained freely from ( http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ and http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in ). • Auxiliary data: Survey of India maps-57B/13, 57B/14, 57F/1,57F/2 with 1:50 0 0 0 scale. • Collateral data: Climate, soils, etc., have been collected from Groundwater Department, Anantapur District, Andhra Pradesh. • The software used: Arc GIS 10.4 and, ERDAS IMAGINE 2014. • Equipment used: Global Positioning System (GPS) • Soil samples: Fifteen soil samples ( Table 1 ) were collected in the location ( Fig. 1 ) for physicochemical analysis. • Climate data: Meteorological data has been collected from the MOSDAC website. 2.3. Fieldwork The purpose of the ﬁeld activity was to collect data on LULC, cropping patterns, and soil texture. The stratiﬁed random sampling approach was used to obtain soil samples (18) from selected sites. Random sample procedures were developed depending on slope, soil, and LULC distribution. These samples were tested in the lab Table 1 Sample locations and their physico chemical parameters.
