The technology packages for commercialisation are available with ICAR-CIFT. Strategies 2: Utilizing Waste Lands/ fallow lands for enhan- Cing production Re-cultivation of fallow lands. Reclamation of degraded lands. Terrace and contour making in difficult terrain lands for arable purpose. Adoption of soil conservation measures and installation of bunds and other artificial structures to check erosion. Growing cover crops in sloppy areas. Consolidation of fragmented holdings. Restricting conversion of farm lands for commercial purposes. All regions. Strategy 3: Promoting Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) Identifying and diagnosing impacts of climate change with reference to specific crops and local conditions. Managing landscapes for improving sustainability, building resilience and mitigating adverse impacts. Water management at watershed and river basin for minimizing vulnerability of production systems. Promotion and extension of improved technologies i.e., seed, integrated nutrient management (INM) including micronutrients, soil amendments, integrated pest management (IPM), input use efficiency and resource conservation technologies along with capacity building of the farmers/extension functionaries. Demonstration and popularization of heat and salt tolerant crop varieties, promotion of micro-irrigation system, etc.
