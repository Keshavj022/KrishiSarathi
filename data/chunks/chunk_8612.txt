 MAIZE IS DISPENSABLE FROM POULTRY FEEDS Maize has remained the principal source of energy in poultry feed for several years but the diversified utility of maize for industrial purposes limited its availability for poultry. The increased cost of maize and its scarcity often prohibited its use in poultry diets. At the Project Directorate on Poultry, Hyderabad, possibilities of alternative energy sources for replacing maize from broiler diets, were explored. Entire maize from broiler starter (57%) and finisher (67%) diets was effectively replaced by korra (foxtail millet) without adversely influencing their body weight, feed consumption and meat yield. Korra as energy source had the advantage of retaining low serum cholesterol level compared to maize. Bajra and ragi were also useful in partially (25%) replacing maize from broiler diets. LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 119 body weight, feed conversion and meat yield was optimum with 18.5% in the diet. It was also supportive in maintaining low serum cholesterol and low fat deposition. The lowest (0.3%) level of methionine was as efficient as higher levels for growth and feed intake for pure lines. But, by increasing methionine level to 0.4% in the diet containing 18.5% protein, a significant improvement in feed conversion efficiency, and size of bursa, and decrease in abdominal fat were achieved. The broiler breeder lines need low concentration of energy, protein and methionine in diets implying minimization of cost on feed, which is the key for economical poultry production. COMPLETE FEEDâ€“AN INNOVATIVE SYSTEM OF FEEDING ANIMALS Complete feeding is a system that provides concentrate and roughages together in blended form, and except water all dietary essentials are supplied through it. It is advantageous against conventional system of feeding because of reduced labour cost, maintenance of uniform roughage concentrate ratio, uniform feed intake favouring uniform supply of nutrients and maintenance of rumen environment. Complete feeds based on crop residues and un-conventional feeds were evaluated for growing, lactating and adult cattle. Growing Animals l 30.0% wheat straw, 18.0% groundnut-cake (deoiled), 20.5% rice polish, 19.0% wheat bran, 1.0% salt, 10.0% molasses and 1.0% mineral mixture supports the growth rate of 435 g/day. It provides 12.0% DCP and 56.0% TDN. l 30.0% sugarcane bagasse, 8.5% maize gluten, 20.0% Prosopis juliflora pods, 12.0% corn steep liquor, 0.5% urea, 8.0% molasses, 1.0% salt and 1.0% mineral mixture supports the growth rate of 497 g/day of growing calves. It provides 12.0% DCP and 58.5% TDN. It is 44% economical in terms of feed cost/day and 33% more economical in terms of feed cost/kg gain than conventional system of feeding. l 40.0%wheat straw, 19.5% deoiled groundnut-cake, 8.0% wheat bran, 10.0% mango seed kernel, 10.0% mineral mixture and 10.0% molasses resulted in growth rate of 450 to 500 g/day in growing calves. It provides 11.0% DCP and 54.0%TDN.
