In peninsular India the tree is very common in the dry as well as moist, mixed deciduous Flower Habit Contents VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY forests; in West Bengal and Assam it is found in the mixed evergreen forests as well. The tree grows sporadically in the mixed deciduous forests in the sub-Himalayan region and lower valleys, and is typical of the alluvial-savannah- type forests, tending to be gregarious near the river-banks. It also occurs in the sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn. f.) forests. Though generally scarce in the hills, it is very common in the bhabar tracts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, especially in the open grazing-grounds in the forests.

Shatawar: The roots of A. racemosus are borne in a compact bunch and are fleshy and spindle-shaped. They are marketed in pieces 5-15 cm in length and 2 cm in thickness. They are silvery white or light ash-coloured externally and white internally, more or less smooth when fresh, developing longitudinal wrinkles when dry. They lack a well-marked odour, but are sweet and bitter in taste. The bark exhibits anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities, whereas the aerial parts produce carcinoma of the pharynx in animal trials.
