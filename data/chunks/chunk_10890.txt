 GIFT Tilapia culture   Exchange of water and replace with borewell water to avoid DO problem   Reduce the biomass by partial harvest, reduce the application of fertilizers to prevent the deterioration of water. Analysis of water quality parameter at at-least monthly once.   Feeding tray (check tray) should be properly monitored to avoid over feeding. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 173 Ornamental fish culture   Application of Oxy tetracycline at the rate of 50 mg/kg of feed for one-week period to control bacterial diseases   Dip treatment with 0.5 ppm KMnO4 and 3% salt solution to control bacterial diseases. Seabass Culture   Size segregation has to be done in the initial stage. Avoid shortage of feeding ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 174 Zone–11 Karnataka General Management Practices to be followed by the farmers   In-situ moisture conservation measures covering both soil and land management practices to be practiced. They include field bunding, compartmental bunding, ridges and furrows, conservation furrows, broad bed and furrow systems, dead furrows at 30 DAS especially in red soils for groundnut, groundnut+redgram, finger millet + pigeonpea, pigeonpea + field bean, pigeonpea + cowpea intercropping, mulches etc.   Frequent interculturing both in kharif and rabi for weed control and moisture conservation.   Avoid dry sowing of crops such as cotton, groundnut especially in shallow soils.   Sowing needs to be done only when sufficient moisture is available in soil root zone. Unless 50- 60mm rainfall is received over a period of 2-3 days, sowing should not be carried out.   Facility of crop insurance including weather-based insurance to be availed.   Follow the weather advisories available for the region.   Do not burn crop residue. Take up rotavator operation in harvested fields of Cotton, Wheat and Safflower for incorporation of stubbles and crop residue in the soil.   Border crops (Jowar/Bajra/Maize) should be practiced in vegetable growing fields which will prevent the vector entry in the main field.   Attend ploughing operation immediately after the harvest of rabi crops which reduces the pest & weed incidence in next season.   Farmers can avail good quality seeds for Kharif sowing from the Raitha Samparka Kendras, Karnataka State Seed Corporation and KVK’s as for as possible. Procurement of the seeds can be made for Kharif sowing: viz: Green gram: DGGV-2, S-4: Black gram: DU-1, Soybean, Rashmi: Dsb-21, JS-335, Groundnut: GKVK-5, ICGV-91114, K6, Kadri Lepakshi, K-1812, G 2-52, GPBD-4 and Redgram: TS3R, BRG-1, 2, 4, 5.   Seeds, seed treatment material and fertilizer required for sowing to be kept ready. Test germination percentage of seeds before sowing, if the seed is not certified.
