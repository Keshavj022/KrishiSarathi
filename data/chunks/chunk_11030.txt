 With the increasing reports on emerging pests and pathogens, the biopesticides are expected to play a major role in sustainable management. Currently, about 20 microorganisms are registered as biopesticides with Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee (CIB & RC). ICAR through its constituent institutes and All India Coordinated Research Projects (AICRPs) has developed and validated various formulations of biopesticides. Challenges faced by biopesticides are lower efficacy and shelf life, narrow host range, inability to reproduce the results under field conditions. Constant efforts are being made by ICAR to overcome these challenges. This bulletin is a compilation of 31 biopesticides developed by ICAR that are at various stages of registration and commercialization.
