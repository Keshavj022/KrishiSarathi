 The observed efficiency of the wood stove, using different fuel materials was compared with the claimed efficiency. In all these trials (except for Manjanethe), the claimed efficiency was 25 to 32% whereas the observed efficiency was lesser than the claimed efficiency, being 21 to 28%. Fig.2. Relative performance of different stoves Table 2.

However, the stove proved more advantagous than the conventional chullah.   METHODS OF WEATHER FORECASTING Code : 1305 Title of the ITK : Case study on warning of heavy rains by observing ants transferring eggs Description of the ITK : Prior indication and prediction of rain helps the farmers to take appropriate decisions on the farm activities. Ants transfer their eggs from one place to another. It is a sign of heavy rain, as followed by the farmers of Nayabas Kutubpur in Bulandshahr district of Uttar Pradesh. Name and address of the discloser : Shri Prem Pal Singh C/o Shri Dal Chand, House No. 38, Purva Ahiran, Indra Chowk, Meerut (Uttar Pradesh) Location of use of the ITK : The ITK is being followed for forecasting rain in several districts of western Uttar Pradesh, specially in Buland Shahr, Badaun, Bareilly, Etah, Aligrah districts. Generally black small ants are considered more reliable to predict rain. The ants generally lay their eggs in holes in earth near the walls or at uplands near the houses. They start taking out their eggs from holes and transfer to a higher place. This is an indication of heavy rains to follow. Experimenters : Dr (Ms) Shagufta Jamal, Reader, Department of Adult and Continuing Education and Extension, Jamia Millia Islamia University, Jamianagar (New Delhi) 110 025 METHODOLOGY PRA and field study Field study was conducted in four villages, viz. Nayabas and Danpur in Bulandshahar district, and Manda and Kamua villages in Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh through PRA to find out the details of ITK actually being used for prediction of rains by the farmers. To quantify the efficacy of ITK, four alternative observations, viz. few ants carrying eggs, ants with eggs in large number, ants carrying eggs from low to high place and Fig. 1. Ants transferring eggs  METHODS OF WEATHER FORECASTING ants carrying eggs to a dry place, were subjected to matrix ranking by the farmers through PRA methods.
