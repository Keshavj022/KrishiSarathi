Future policies must also prioritise decentralised power distribution systems to reduce reliance on traditional grids, especially in underserved areas. Electrifying rural regions and implementing local, small-scale, community-based renewable projects can provide access to energy for vulner- able populations and help boost domestic power production. Solar pumps, which are being promoted for farmers under the PM KUSUM scheme in India since March 2019 to pump water to irrigate their ﬁelds, are a good case in point. How- ever, their adoption has been slow, as they can only be used effectively when the water table is closer to the surface since solar power has a lower CUF than oil or coal. This implies that the actual output derived from solar energy infrastructure falls signiﬁcantly below its maximum poten- tial output. Consequently, to achieve a comparable energy yield, a greater quantity of solar panels and associated infra- structure is required compared to fossil fuels28. Therefore, solar pumps suitable for deeper tube wells require more solar panels, thus offsetting the beneﬁts due to increased cost.
