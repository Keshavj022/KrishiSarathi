 Hierar­ chical Cluster Analysis (HCA) was conducted on the normalized data set to group the examined variables using Ward’s algorithm and Euclidean distances as an attribute of similarity. Pearson correlation and HCA were carried out with the help of R (version 2.1) and IBM-SPSS (version 20.0) software. 2.4. Hydro-geochemical assessment The relationship involving major cations and anions, along with their behavior, was explained by the hydro-chemical facies of groundwater. Hydro-chemical properties enable the identification of several water types [36] as well as the knowledge of groundwater’s genesis and hydrogeological development. As a result, the hydrogeochemical facies of groundwater was determined by plotting the concentrations of main cations in mEq/L−1 (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+) and anions (Cl, SO4, and HCO3) on a Piper diagram as. Type-I (Ca–HCO3 type), Type-II (Na–Cl type), Type-III (mixed Ca–Na–HCO3 type), Type- IV (mixed Ca–Mg–Cl type), Type-V (Ca–Cl type), Type-VI (mixed Ca–Mg–Cl type), Type-VI (mixed Ca–Mg–Cl type), Type-VI (mixed Ca–Mg–Cl (Na–HCO3 type) [37]. The two primary hydrogeochemical facies are Na–Cl–SO4 and mixed Ca–Na–HCO3 type. 2.5. Water quality index In this study, BIS was selected as the standard unit. The standards that are not described in BIS, WHO standards were chosen for them. Out of all selected parameters, Total Suspended solids (TSS) is not recog­ nized on both BIS (BIS, 1991) and WHO guidelines; henceforth National Environment Management Authority (Kenya) standard was designated here. Out of the nineteen parameters datasets, fourteen parameters were selected for the assessment of WQI due to unavailability of the desirable range. Relative weights from 1 to 4 out of five were consigned depending upon their significance and prior literature reviews [38,39]. The selected parameters for WQI and their assigned weights were shown on Table 4. After that relative weight was given to each selected water quality parameters by following this equation: Wi = Rn ∑n i=1Rn (1) Table 1 Water sample points and theirs codes.
