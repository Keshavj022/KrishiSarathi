, 2018), high GPP values in ACZ II and ACZ III could be due to their heavy reliance on groundwater for irrigation practices and climate type (Table 1). 3.4. Agricultural drought assessment from NVSWI Spatio-temporal analysis of NVSWI indicated that the ACZ I suffered recurring moderate-to-light drought occurrences during the period of study (Fig. 8). However, the worst drought events occurred in the years 2001–02, 2002–03, 2003–04, and 2005–06, and the NDVI values were also relatively low during these events. From Table 2, it is also clear that more than 75% of the agricultural area in the ACZ I remained in the slight to severe drought category, and from 2010 onwards, the area under this category showed progressive decrease. In ACZ II > 80% agricultural area was under slight to severe drought in the years 2001–02, 2002–03, 2003–04, 2005–06, and 2009–10 while during 2018–19 and 2019–20 it decreased significantly. In 2015–16, severe to slight droughts were recorded in parts of Haryana state, but when moving towards Punjab, the area under slight drought was reduced. It is Fig. 5.

Agricultural Water Management 274 (2022) 107956 10 also noticeable that during these drought events, the area under severe to slight drought in ACZ II of Haryana was greater when compared to Punjab. The area under severe to slight drought in ACZ III was more than 80% in 2001–02, 2002–03, 2003–04, 2005–06, 2009–10, and 2015–16, but it has been reduced to nearly 20% in 2018–19 and also majority of the area remained drought free during 2018–20. Although, all the ACZs experienced the agricultural drought at different time periods, during the year 2009–10, majority of the study area (75% of the area of ACZ I, 85% of ACZ II and 84% of III) remained under a slight drought, indi­ cating the maximum spatial extent of the agricultural area. During the year 2018–19 and 2019–20, all the ACZs remained almost drought free except a few scattered pockets, and SPI during this time period also reflected normal conditions. However, as per SPI the wettest years were 2008–09 and 2011–12, but the optimum soil moisture content, timing and frequency of irrigation and rainfall, temperature, CO2 concentra­ tion, tropospheric ozone (O3) concentration, pests and fertilizer use also plays a major role for plant growth (Daloz et al., 2021). Time of early drought and low soil moisture content affects the germination, forma­ tion of seedling and early vigor while terminal droughts influence the ear formation and grain filling of wheat which might be overcome by artificial irrigation (Latiri et al., 2010). Hence, the study shows that NVSWI may be used to map, monitor, and assess agricultural dryness, Fig. 6.
