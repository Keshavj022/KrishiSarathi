 Planofix 10 ppm solution can be sprayed thrice at flowering, after fruit set and one month before harvest. It minimizes the fruit drop and increases yield considerably.

The orchard to be kept clean and weed free. Integrated pest management involving suitable insect traps, pheromones, biological and chemical methods to be followed. Diseases Quick decline or dieback: Tolerant rootstocks such as sweet orange, trifoliate orange and Rangapur lime have to be used for propagation. Virus free plants to be planted. Best management practices to be followed and the crop should not experience deficit or excess moisture stress. Greening disease: Insect vector to be controlled by spraying systemic insecticide. Root rot: Care must be taken to prevent irrigation water coming in contact with tree the trunk. Bordeaux paste has to be painted on trunks up to 65 cm above the ground level. For effective management of dry root rot, soil drenching with Mancozeb is recommended. Harvesting and post-harvest technology The bearing starts from third year onwards. The sweet lime produces 2 – 3 crops in a year in South India. First harvest will be from December to February, second from March to May and third harvest from June to September. The fruits have to be picked at fully matured stage when they develop their characteristic flavor to the maximum and the green colour of the fruit gradually changes to light greenish yellow colour. The fruits after harvest may be treated with ethylene gas to obtain uniform ripening. Sweet lime yields about 1,000 to 2,000 fruits per tree. The fruits are eaten raw and squashes and juices are also prepared. The fruits can be preserved in cold storage at 7 – 8oC for 4 – 8 weeks. Mosambi based intercropping system Fruit based Agri-horticulture system mainly focuses on higher income per unit area. The farmer can practice intercropping during the early stages of the fruit trees.
