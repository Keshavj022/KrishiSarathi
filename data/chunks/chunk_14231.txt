km Scrubland on a steep slope Barren land Aeolian sand along the river Dry soils High alkaline pH Thin soils and rocky lands with precipitous slope Agriculture and planting are not possible on these sites. Agriculture and planting are not permitted in areas under habitation, open rocks, roads, thick reserves, and protected forests. With variances in producer and user accuracy, the total accu- racy of the classiﬁed map is estimated to be 86.45%. ( Table 5 ). The highly suitable lands and not suitable land are estimated at 93.75% and 91.3% accuracy for producers and 85.71% and 97.67% for users, respectively. The accuracy assessment method has mostly been used for image classiﬁcation. However, in the present study, some thematic maps are prepared using IWD interpolation tech- niques and used with satellite data in weighted overlay techniques. Therefore, some patches of moderately suitable lands are inter- mixed with marginally suitable lands show lesser accuracy i.e., 72.27 % and 88.63% for producers and 82.75% and 80.85% for users, respectively were obtained. 9 B.N.

Conclusions MCDM tool with GIS was used to generate land suitability anal- ysis maps for agriculture in the study region in southern India. RS and ﬁeld data were used to assess several derived thematic layers such as geology, GM, soils, slope, DD, LULC, soil nitrogen, soil phosphorous, and soil potassium. Expert opinions and analy- sis were utilized to determine the effect of certain criteria, which were then computed using MCDM and the AHP, which was used to allocate weights. Based on our ﬁndings, current cropping pat- terns, i.e., rice with intensive agriculture possibilities, if irrigation is provided, highly suitable land (80.53 sq.km) has no major lim- 10 B.N.

Moderately suitable land (87.38 sq.km) is also suﬃcient for agriculture, although it requires careful farm management. Marginally suitable land (82.34 sq.km) for crops is marginally suit- able and, Not suitable lands (53.07 sq.km), thus certain terrac- ing needs, additional inputs such as fertilizers, protection from in- tense run-off and erosion, etc. As a result, decisions might be made with a thorough understanding of the effects as well as future land use development constraints.
