 In case of CSS having no State share and where as per the scheme guidelines, funds are released by the Central Ministry/Department directly to the districts/blocks/Gram Panchayats/Implementing agencies, the requirement of notifying a single Nodal Agency and opening of a Single Nodal Account at the State level may be waived by the Secretary of the Central Ministry/Department concerned in consultation with the Financial Adviser. 24. UTs without legislature work directly in PFMS. Therefore, there is no need for them to open a Single Nodal Account. They will ensure that the funds are released to the vendors/beneficiaries 'just in time'. In case funds are to be released to any agency as per scheme guidelines, provision of Rule 230 (vii) of GRF 2017 will be strictly followed to avoid parking of funds, with agencies. 25. Ministries/Departments shall undertake monthly review of the release of funds (both the Central and State Share) from the State treasury to the SNA, utilization of funds by SNAs and IAs and outputs/outcomes vis-a-vis the targets for each CSS. This issues with the approval of Secretary (Expenditure) and shall supersede all earlier guidelines on this subject. (Subhash Chandra Meena) Director (FCD) 011-24368543 E-mail: subhash.meena@nic.
