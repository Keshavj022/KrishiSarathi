One such vital technology for safeguarding animal health and welfare is oral magnet therapy, which involves administering oral magnets to large dairy animals, such as cattle and buffaloes, to prevent traumatic reticuloperitonitis (TRP), or 'Hardware Disease.' Oral magnets are standardized and recommended for TRP prevention, and in this project, magnets were administered to a total of 162 animals, including 102 buffaloes and 60 cows, from 2016 to 2024. The intervention was conducted in three villages of Barnala district—Kalala, Chananwal, and Moom—benefiting a total of 60 farmers. None of the beneficiaries in these villages have reported any cases of TRP to date. An economic analysis of TRP prevention demonstrated the substantial economic benefits of oral magnet therapy, highlighting its effectiveness in preventing significant financial losses. Keywords: Animal, Dairy, Farmer FIRST, Health, Magnet, Reticuloperitonitis, Welfare T RAUMATIC reticuloperitonitis (TRP), commonly known as 'Hardware Disease', is a significant condition affecting dairy animals, particularly cattle and buffaloes. It occurs when animals ingest sharp metallic objects, such as nails or wires, which lodge in the reticulum (the second compartment of their stomach). These objects can penetrate the reticulum wall, causing inflammation, infection, and, in severe cases, damage to surrounding organs. The disease has substantial economic impacts on dairy farms, directly affecting productivity and profitability. One of the most immediate economic impacts of TRP is a sharp decline in milk production. Affected animals experience pain, discomfort, and reduced appetite, leading to decreased feed intake. Since dairy production is closely linked to the animal’s nutritional intake, a reduction in feed consumption directly results in lower milk yields. This decline can persist for weeks or even months, causing significant financial losses for dairy farmers. Treating TRP can be costly due to the need for veterinary services, including diagnostic aids, medication, and possibly surgery. In severe cases, where the metal object punctures vital organs such as the heart, lungs, or diaphragm, the condition can lead to sudden death or necessitate euthanasia. Losing a high- producing dairy cow or buffalo can represent a major economic setback, especially if the animal is genetically Indian Farming 74 (10): 25-27; October 2024 valuable or highly productive.
