 One Health and Transboundary Diseases: Recognize the enhanced need for cooperation and research on transboundary diseases and One Health issues. MAHARISHI: Supported the launch of the â€œMillets and Other Ancient Grains International Research Initiative (MAHARISHI) to strengthen the research collaboration and public awareness of these grain crops. The G20-MACS 2023 summit provided an invaluable opportunity for leaders to develop strategies that enhance agricultural productivity, improve supply chains, and reduce food waste. By promoting sustainable farming practices, investing in rural infrastructure, and fostering technology-driven innovation, the G20 strives to create a future where food security is a reality for all. Agriculture is deeply intertwined with climate change, both as a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and as a sector vulnerable to its impacts. The G20 recognizes the urgent need to transform agricultural practices to build climate resilience. Through initiatives that encourage climate-smart agriculture, sustainable land management, and the adoption of innovative technologies, the G20 Summit supports the transition to low-carbon and resilient farming systems. By fostering knowledge sharing and collaboration, the G20 aims to create a sustainable food production model that mitigates climate risks while ensuring productivity and livelihoods for farmers. By championing initiatives that promote sustainable land management, precision agriculture, and the adoption of climate-resilient crop varieties, the G20 seeks to create an agricultural sector that mitigates climate risks while ensuring productivity and livelihoods for farmers. Through knowledge sharing, collaborative research, and innovative policy approaches, the G20 aims to unlock the transformative power of climate-smart agriculture. The G20 Summit places a strong emphasis on inclusive agricultural development, particularly in low-income and developing countries. Recognizing that agriculture is a vital sector for job creation and poverty reduction, the summit supports initiatives to empower smallholder farmers, promote gender equality in agriculture, and enhance access to finance and markets. By addressing the unique challenges faced by small-scale farmers, the G20 strives to create an enabling environment that empowers them to thrive and contribute to the global food system. Technological advancements and digitalization have the potential to revolutionize agriculture and address critical challenges. The G20 Summit provides a platform for leaders to explore how innovation, data-driven approaches, and precision agriculture can enhance productivity, sustainability, and resilience. By fostering public-private partnerships, promoting research and development, and facilitating technology transfer, the G20 encourages the adoption of cutting-edge solutions that can revolutionize agricultural practices and ensure the well-being of farming communities.
