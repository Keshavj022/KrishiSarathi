 Urea 2% foliar spray at flowering and pod development stages increased grain yield of rabi mungbean and rabi urdbean in peninsular India. Crop Protection Mungbean UPM 98-1, M 267, ML 881 and MH 98-1 have been identified as resistant to mungbean yellow mosaic virus and anthracnose. PIGEONPEA GENOTYPES RESISTANT TO DISEASES IDENTIFIED MAL 13, RA 6, JKM 1, JKM 169, KPL 143 Fusarium wilt and KPL 44 OGUK 1, MA 6, KPL 43, KPL 44, MAL 15, Sterility mosaic Pusa (B) 34, Pusa (B) 35, IPA 98-3 and RA 6 KPL 43, PP 16 K, PP 17 K, PPKL 6 Multiple resistance to wilt and sterility and PSMR 2006 K mosaic and tolerance to Phytophthora blight diseases Resistant donors identified in mungbean and urdbean Resistant to Mungbean Urdbean Yellow mosaic virus UPM 98, UPM 98-1, PMB 63, KU 96-3, PLU 63 ML 818 Cercospora leaf spot UPM 98-1, HUM 7,PDM 96-262 - Powdery mildew UPM 98-1, HUM 7, PMB 63, TU 99-852, TU 843 ML 131 Pod-borer ML 818, ML 131, Pusa 105, AKU 18, TU 9814, BM 4, HUM 7, Pusa 9771 OBG 16, TAU 2 ● ●● ●● Identified mungbean ML 818, which shows resistance to yellow mosaic virus, Cercospora leaf-spot and bacterial leaf-spot, for Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. ● Intercropping of mungbean and urdbean with soybean or pearl millet reduced pod- borer damage. CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 35 Two sprays of Carbendazim (0.05%) were effective and economical against web- blight and one was effective against powdery mildew. Urdbean IPU 91-3, IPU 91-711, IPU 94-1, IPU 94-2, IPU 94-4, IPU 96-123, IPU 97-73, DPU 88-1 and DPU 88-31 are found resistant against mungbean yellow mosaic virus under high disease pressure. And KU 96-3, PLU 277 and PLU 461 are found resistant against MYMV and anthracnose. Intercropping in pearl millet or soybean reduced pod-borer damage in mungbean and urdbean. λ-Cyhalothrin at 0.04% in mungbean gave maximum pod-borer control. Foliar spray with NSKE (5%) + λ-Cyhalothrin (0.02%) gave maximum control of pod-borer with higher grain yield in urdbean. LENTIL For lentil breeding, resistant sources for wilt and root-rot are IPL 128, PL 131, PL 95-16, L 5258 and L 4659 and for collar-rot and rust are IPL 128, IPL 133 and PL 95-16. DPL 25 and DPL 58 have showed consistent resistance against rust. Even though there is a 16-17% reduction in seed germination, still seed treatment with kerosene oil (2-5%) has been effective in reducing wilt by 31-46% with consequent yield increase of 48-52%. Seed treatment with Carbendazim (Bavistin 50 WP) + Thiram (Thiram 75 DS) at 0.1% each significantly controlled wilt (39- 51%) and increased seed yield (86-154%). Two sprays of zinc sulphate (0.1%) controlled rust to the extent of 54% over unsprayed crop, and resulted in 10% additional yield with cost : benefit ratio of 1:1.75. RAJMASH IIPR 96-4, a selection from exotic line ET 8447, has been identified for eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa. It has 11.4% yield superiority over check PDR 14, and matures in 135-140 days.
