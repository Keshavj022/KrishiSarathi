In comparison, animals treated with allopathic medicine (streptopenicillin) showed only 70 % recovery. Foot lesions showed recovery by day 7 of ITK treatment. Importantly, no maggots were developed during the course of the treatment with camphor and coconut oil. The foot lesions did not recover fully in the allopathic treatment group probably due to non-application of local antiseptics. Table 3.

However, the conventional veterinary treatment resulted in recovery from foot and mouth lesions within 6 to 7 days. Wound exudation, pain and lameness decreased in both the treated groups after 4 days of treatment. However, in ITK treatment group, pain on the site of lesions did not subside completely and the gait of animals showed slight lameness till the period of observation (Table 3). The results indicated that ITK was moderately effective in the management of foot lesions in FMD. Animals treated with roasted brinjal and pure ghee paste at OUAT showed the healing of mouth lesions in 10-11 days. Animals treated with camphor + coconut oil recovered in 8 â€”10 days, with complete healing of lesions. The recovery period with conventional veterinary treatment was 5-6 days. CONCLUSION The ITK consisting of use of roasted brinjal in ghee and camphor in coconut oil for mouth and foot lesion, respectively in FMD was initially validated at veterinary college, BAU and was found effective in curing mouth lesions completely and foot lesions partially in cases of FMD. The ITK was cross-validated at veterinary colleges of BAU, OUAT and WBUFS. The findings from BAU which demonstrated that ITK was highly effective in management of mouth and foot lesions due to FMD. At other two centres the ITK was found moderately effective.
