 The results (Table 4) indicate that in the sweet where cloves were placed, no ants were observed even after 10 days. This is irrespective of number where cloves were not placed (control), ants were seen in 25 cases. In 15 cases the ants were seen within 2 days, whereas in 8 cases the ants were observed within 5 days and in the next 5 days the ants were seen in seven more cases. Among the samples, where 15 cloves were placed, no ant was observed even in 10 days. But where 10 cloves were placed, ants were observed after 10 days of observation. In one case the ants were seen even on fifth day of observation. No ant was observed in this category during first 2 days. In the samples where only five cloves were placed, ants were seen in 20 samples out of 30. In two cases ants were seen on the third day of observation, whereas Table 5.

But where the cloves were not placed, ants were observed in two cases on the second day and on 5th day the ants were observed in all the remaining eight cases. The results of the experiment indicate that cloves acted as repellent to ants and the sweet in another 8 cases ants were observed after 5 days. After 10 days the ants were seen in 10 additional samples. Thus for proper protection of sugar from ants, cloves may be placed with sugar in the pot at the rate of 15 cloves/kg sugar. Table 6.

Among the samples remained safe from them. II Phase Sugar: Experiments were conducted during the last week of June and first week of July, 2003. The results (Table 5) indicate that in the sugar  GRAIN/ SEED STORAGE where 20 cloves were placed, no ant was observed in any sample even after 10 days (Table 6). Among the samples where 10 cloves were placed the ants were seen in 10 cases, in five cases after 5 days and in another five cases after 10 days. In the samples where 15 cloves were placed, ants were seen in five cases only, in three cases after 5 days and in additional two cases after 10 days. Table 7.

In eight cases ants did not go. Similarly, where 5 cloves were placed the ants did not go in 13 cases.
