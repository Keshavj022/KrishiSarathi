Package of Practices (Annexure-XII) 232  • MPMH 17 is a dual-purpose hybrid of pearl millet with high grain and stover yields. • The hybrid MPMH 17 is a cross between a male-sterile line ICMA 04999 (female parent) and a restorer MIR 525-2 (male parent). The line ICMA 04999 is based on A1 source of cytoplasmic male-sterility. • Tested in the All -India Coordinated Pearl Millet Improvement Project trials during 2009-2011 at 57 locations (18 locations each in 2009 and 2011; and 21 locations in 2010) along with four checks — Pusa 23, ICMH 356, GHB 744 and RHB 121. • Consistent performance of MPMH 17 during the three years of evaluation— hybrid ranked first among all the test entries including checks in 2009 and 2011, and ranked 2nd in 2010.
