 Termites in mid-rib of infested cane setts Fig. 2. Cane setts infested with termites  PEST AND DISEASE MANGEMENT was laid out with treatments in standing crop. Just before placing the setts in the trench, soil applications of treatments were made based upon germination percentage of setts the infestation percentage was worked out. Those setts which failed to germinate were dug out in all cases of the treatments. On-farm trials were laid out with the farmers for validation of the ITK using RBD design having four treatments, viz. T 1 (lime 39 kg/ha + salt 78 kg/ha), T 2 (salt alone 78 kg/ha), T 3 (phorate 10 kg/ha) and T 4 (control). The technical parameters considered weire: (i) pattern of insect pest infestation , (ii) soil type, (iii) crop stage for appropriate management and applications, (iv) Impact on healthy crop stand, (v) percentage of insect pest reduction and (vi) association with other pests. The economic parameters were: yield and cost-benefit analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study The result of PRA matrix ranking shows significant difference in technological options of chemical control, application of lime and salt as well as salt alone (Table 1). For efficacy, chemical control measure ranked higher. Application of salt alone ranked higher for cost effectiveness, ease of use and yield. Variation among the technological options for criteria of side effect to soil and crop was not significant, though they ranked chemical measure higher for it. Matrix ranking was repeated among farmers of Harela and Hareli villages of Shajahanpur district. (Table 2). Farmers of Shajahanpur region too perceived chemical measures more efficacious in management of termites in Table 2.

Farmers reported that incidence of termite is more in light soil . Soil application of lime and salt in trenches before placing the cane setts kills the termites and thus setts are saved from their damage. Users felt that soil being light, the salt is leached with irrigation and thus the side- effect of salt to soil is minimized.They considered lime helpful for their soil.
