2 kg/ acre depending on soil type effectively controls most of the broad- leaved weeds for about 3-4 weeks. As post emergence application at 20-25 days of crop period or 4 leaf stage of weeds, spraying of Atrazine or 2,4-D Sodium salt 80 WP @ 400g or Tembotrione @ 120 ml + Atrazine 400g or Halosufuron @ 40 g/acre in 200 lit of water will effectively control weeds. After 30-35 days, crop may be inter-cultivated and earthing up is done. For the management of stem borer in endemic areas, prophylactic spraying of Monocrotophos 36 SL @ 1.6 ml/l or Chlorantraniliprole 20 SC @ 0.3 ml/l when the crop is 10-12 days old and application of Carbofuran 3 G in leaf whorls @ 3 kg/acre is recommended when the crop is 25-30 days old. For the management of fall army worm, spraying of 5% (5ml/l) neem oil to control egg masses and first instar larvae or spraying of chlorpyrifos 25 EC 400 ml or Quinolphos 25EC 400ml in 200 litres of water per acre is recommended. The spray should be directed into whorls. When the infestation is heavy, Emamectin benzoate 5SG @80g (0.4g/l) or Spinosad 45SE @60ml (0.3 ml/l) in 200 lit of water should be sprayed per acre. Poison baiting is effective in controlling later instar larvae. 10 kg rice bran + 2kg jaggery in 2 lit of water are mixed and fermented for 24 hrs. Next day 100g Thiodicarb is mixed and dropped in the whorls of the plants. Pulses Varieties: Green gram (Vigna radiata) Rabi-Uplands: LGG 460, LGG 407, TM 96-2, WGG 42, IPM 2-14.
