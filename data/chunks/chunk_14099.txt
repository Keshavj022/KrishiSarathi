 The main sources of Cl−are household sewage, fertil­ izers, and seepage from septic tanks and drainage systems. Sulfate (SO4 2−) content fluctuate between 23 mg/L to 542 mg/L, with an average concentration of 199.8 mg/L. In irrigation water, SO4 2− concentration should be below the 400 mg/L (Vasanthavigar et al., 2012). About 6 % (n = 6) of groundwater samples are above the level of 400 mg/L. As a result, soil becomes more acidic. Moreover, high SO4 irrigation water reduces the amount of phosphorus found in plants (Zouahri et al., 2015). 3.2. Estimating irrigation water quality Irrigation water quality metrics including SAR, %Na, PI, RSC, KR, and MHR are explained in detail here. The primary focus is on charac­ terizing the impacts of irrigation water quality on agricultural devel­ opment and yield. Taking appropriate management measures to enhance crop development and ultimately increase food production is greatly influenced by the combined effect of %Na, SAR, RSC, PI, KR, and MHR on crop output (Fig. 3) (Uddin et al., 2021;Subba Rao et al., 2018). 3.2.1. Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) The SAR value fluctuate between 0.3261 and 6.268 with average value of 3.184 (Table 4). According to Aravinthasamy et al. (2020) and Rao et al. (2016), the values are divided into four groups (Table 5). Samples are excellent if SAR is 10; if SAR is between 10 and 18, doubtful if SAR is from 18 to 26, and unsuitable if SAR is more than 26. In the study area, the SAR is almost at a safe level for irrigation purposes. Fluctuation in EC also increase the salinity hazard. on this basis, EC is classified into four groups: Excellent (< 250 µs/cm), good (250–750 µs/ cm), permissible (750–2250 µs/cm), and unsuitable (>2250 µs/cm). About 9 % (n = 8), 81 % (n = 77), and 10 % (n = 9) of groundwater samples fall in good, permissible, and unsuitable types. The United State Soil Laboratory diagram (USSL 1954) is used to demonstrate the collective result of SAR (S) and EC (C) on the growth of crops. This diagram splits into 16 regions for irrigation on the basis of irrigation water quality. There are four sub-zones under salinity hazard (C); (1) low (C1: < 250 μS/cm), (2) medium (C2: 250 to 750 μS/cm), (3) high (C3: 750 to 2250 μS/cm), and (4) extremely high (C4: > 2250 μS/ cm), considering good, moderate, bad, and extremely poor water quality types. Similarly, there are four sub-zones for salt hazard (S); (1) low sodium hazard (S1: < 10), (2) medium sodium danger (S2: 10 to 18), (3) high sodium hazard (S3: 18 to 26), and (4) very high sodium hazard (S4: > 26), which are also considered good, moderate, poor, and extremely poor-quality types, respectively. From Fig. 4, 77 % (n = 73) of groundwater samples in the high saline with low alkaline zone (C3-S1) zone, that means that water is not used in Table 4 Computed IWQI parameters for the Arjunanadi River basin, south India.
