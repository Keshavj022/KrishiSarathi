Lessons learned We introduced an integrated hybrid workflow for estimating wheat crop biophysical variables from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral imagery in the spectral range of 400-1000 nm. To develop hybrid models, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) machine learning regression algorithm was applied to PROSAIL simulations. Theoretical validation using eight regression models revealed the superiority of GPR. Suitable dimensionality reduction and active learning techniques were combined to mitigate the problems of redundancy and suboptimal model training. Two active learning (AL) techniques, i.e., residual active learning (RSAL) and Euclidean distance-based diversity (EBD), were selected for the GPR modelling of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC). In brief, significant contributions of the proposed study is that a clear distinction of in situ values could be observed among plots and within plots, facilitating the use of these results for efficient farm nutrient management practices. Since these variables are clear indicators of plant stress, the retrieved within-field variability maps can be coupled with applied nutrient information to make decisions to improve crop health and yield. 6.
