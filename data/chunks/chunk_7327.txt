Overall, 100 kg sliced ginger/turmeric dries (moisture 10% w/w) in 4–5 days under tunnel drier in comparison to 10–12 days under open solar drying at Meghalaya.

Hydrological modeling using RUSLE and WEPP revealed an increasing trend in annual soil Oyster mushroom strain (PL-19-04) CLIMATE CHANGE AND RESILIENT AGRICULTURE ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 17 farm income of resource poor farmers. In Meghalaya, farmers are showing great interest in adopting this enterprise. Paddy straw was used as substrate. Seven oyster mushroom (Pleurotus sp.) strains were evaluated in low cost mushroom house. One oyster mushroom strain PL-19-04 was identified with biological efficiency of 96% after evaluation in low cost mushroom house. This strain took 17 days for spawn run. Climate resilient approaches in coconut: In an open top chamber experiment with coconut seedlings, increasing CO2 concentration (400–700 ppm) increased the rate of photosynthesis (Pn) by 45%, which resulted in high biomass accumulation (29.
