 The cages, each sized 48 m² (6m x 4m x 4m), were provided by the Department of Fisheries, Government of Tripura. One cage was stocked with Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) at a rate of 2000 fish per cage. These fish were fed pellet feed (2-3 mm) at 5% of their body weight during the initial 3 months, followed by 3% of the fish body weight for the subsequent three months. The average size of the fish at the time of stocking was 10 g. After 6 months of rearing, the fish size had grown to 500 g, with a survival rate of 92%. The total fish production from the cage was estimated to be 920 kg, with a Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) of approximately 1.6. The total operational expenditure for one cycle of 6 months was estimated to be `72,600. This included the costs of fish seeds, feeds, and miscellaneous expenses such as hiring boats, repairing nets, and transporting feeds. The total benefit generated from this venture was estimated to be `1,38,000, resulting in a net benefit of `65,400 over 6 months. The Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) was approximately 2.0. This positive outcome from the intervention indicates significant potential for CBCC in Northeast India. It underscores the importance of proper training, demonstration, and capacity-building programs to ensure the successful implementation of CBCC in the region. SUMMARY CBCC stands as a potentially transformative practice in NE India, promising economic growth, social empowerment, and environmental sustainability. Through meticulous planning, active stakeholder participation, and effective regulatory supervision, this approach holds the potential to usher in livelihood diversification, heightened fish production, and enhanced resource management. By capitalizing on the region’s aquatic resources and its cultural connection to water-related activities, NE India can seize the advantages offered by CBCC to pave the way for a prosperous and sustainable future. *Corresponding author e-mail: chandannath23@gmail.com TEXTBOOK ON CHEESE TECHNOLOGY TECHNICAL ASPECTS Pages: v + 369; Price: ` 600.00, US$ 90.00; Postage: `50 ISBN No.: 978-81-7164-273-1 For obtaining copies, please contact: Business Unit ICAR-Directorate of Knowledge Management in Agriculture Krishi Anusandhan Bhawan – I, Pusa, New Delhi 110012 Tel: 011-25843657; email: bmicar@icar.org.in, businessuniticar@gmail.com website: www.icar.gov.in “Textbook on Cheese Technology” is an excellent compilation of the basics of cheese technology, incorporating the advances that are taking place in the modern cheese industry in order to tackle issues such as cheese manufacturing, quality, mechanization, safety, cost, environment etc. This textbook is written with a view to cater to the evolving needs of the rapidly growing cheese industry and highly suited for the Dairy and Food Science Colleges of the globe.
