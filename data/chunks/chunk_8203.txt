Cucumber: The cucumber responded positively with water application from 50% (9.85 t/ha) to 100% ET (27.5 t/ha) through SDI. The yield realized under SDI with 100% ET was 1.38 times higher than control. However, it declined faster with decreasing amount of water and reduced to one-third with 50% ET compared to 100% ET. Water-use efficiency (WUE) under SDI with 50, 60, 80 and 100% ET was 65.23, 93.55, 97.80 and 91.17 kg/mm, respectively. Potato: The productivity of selected potato varieties, viz. Kufri Garima, Kufri Khyati, Kufri Sadabahar, Kufri Pukhraj and Kufri Bahar, were maximum at higher soil moisture regime when irrigations given at IW:CPE ratio of 2.5 and was lower with irrigations applied at critical stages of crop growth. The productivity of all varieties was maximum @ 210 kg N /ha and at par with 180 kg N/ha. Tuber crops: Maximum corm yield (51.15 t/ha) in elephant-foot yam was obtained with irrigation at 50% CPE along with crop residue mulching followed by irrigation at 50% CPE with plastic mulching (48.9 tonnes /ha) as compared to rainfed crop (26.5 t/ha). Fertigation studies in cassava indicated that different levels of N and K (75,100 and 125kg/ha) were on par with respect to tuber yield. The interaction, 125kg/ha N and 75kg/ha K produced maximum tuber yield (50.3 t/ha). Spices Maximum seed yield of different seed spice crops was recorded under drip fertigation and lowest with surface irrigation. Maximum yield was recorded in fennel (2449.5 kg/ha), followed by fenugreek (2316.8 kg/ha), dill (1908.7 kg/ha), coriander (1558.4 kg/ha) and celery (718.7 kg/ha) under drip fertigation method. Horticulture Farming Systems Mango: Mango-based cropping system standardized for enhanced income using a shade-loving fern (Nephrolepis tuberosa). It was found most remunerative intercrop for mango orchards with production of 8,55,000 leaves/ha, fetching ` 2-3 lakh of additional income per hectare. Ferns are planted at 45-60cm × 45-60 cm (row- to-row × plant-to-plant) on bunds in tree interspaces leaving 2m from the tree trunk of fully-grown up (40 year old) trees of mango cv. Dashehari. Plantation crops In coconut plantations, pulse, viz. pigeonpea, mung bean and urd bean under storey crops recorded seed yield of 554, 410 and 390 kg/ ha. These pulse crops produced 1.5 (pigeonpea) to 2.7 t/ha (mung bean and urd bean) stover that could serve as potential fodder to livestock.
