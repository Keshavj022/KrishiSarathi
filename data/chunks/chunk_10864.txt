   Under submergence due to excess rains, drain the excess water at the earliest, apply 20+10 kg N and K/ha, loosen soil, spray 2 % KNO3 or 19:19:19 or 20:20:20 or 21:21:21   Use yellow and blue sticky traps @ 10 /acre to control the sucking pests.   Spray neem oil 3000 ppm @ 5 ml/l at the early stage of sucking pest incidence. Maize   Adopt deep summer ploughing and mechanized sowing. Sow during 15th June to 15th July. If monsoon is delayed, sowing can be extended up to first week of August using short duration hybrids under assured irrigation.   Seed rate 8 kg per acre for normal hybrids, 4 kg per acre for sweetcorn, 5 kg per acre for popcorn and 10 kg per acre for baby corn.   Seed treatment: Cyantraniliprole + Thiomethoxam @ 6 ml/kg against Fall Army Worm (FAW).   Sow fodder maize as a trap crop around maize and install pheromone traps @ 25/ha to monitor and manage FAW. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 144   Atrazine @ 800-1200 g/acre as pre-emergence herbicide immediately after sowing, 2-4-D sodium salt 500 gm/acre for broad leaved weeds or Tembotrion (Laudis) @ 115ml/acre at 25- 30DAS.   Spray Emamectin benzoate @ 0.4 g/lt or Spinosad @ 0.3 ml/lt directing to leaf whorls of the crop, duly wearing masks and protective clothing to manage FAW. Groundnut   Deep summer ploughing with sub-soiler or chisel plough to break sub soil hard pan and increase water holding capacity.   Grow high yielding and drought tolerant varieties like Kadiri-9, Kadiri Harithandhra, Anantha, Greeshma, Narayani, Abhaya, Dharani, ICGV91114, Kadiri Amaravathi, Kadiri Chitravathi, Nityaharitha (TCGS-1157) and Kadiri Lepakshi (K-1812)   Kadiri Lepakshi (K-1812) variety need double dosage fertilizers compared to the other varieties   Grow Pigeonpea, Castor, maize, ragi and green gram as alternate crops if groundnut seeds are not available   Sow rainfed groundnut after receipt of 50 mm cumulative rainfall during SW monsoon. Avoid early sowing after first rains during June and late sowing after 1st week of August.   Form conservation furrows at 3.6 m interval to conserve soil moisture   Application gypsum @ 500 kg/ha at 45 days after sowing   Seed treatment with imidacloprid 600 FS @ 2 ml/kg followed by tebuconazole 2 DS @ 1g or mancozeb @ 3 g/kg or Trichoderma viride @ 10g/kg to control sucking pests collar rot, PSND in the early stages.   Sow 4-6 rows of bajra/jowar as border crop to manage vectors (thrips) of PSND/PBND diseases.   Adopt intercropping with redgram / Castor at 7:1 ratio. Adopt line sowing with ferti cum seed drill   Use PSB, KSB, VAM etc. and reduce chemical fertilizer applications.   Dig farm ponds to conserve rainwater and utilize for life saving irrigation through micro irrigation systems like drip and sprinklers. Spray 19:19:19 @1 kg/ac or Urea @ 4 kg/ac during dry spell to mitigate drought.   Follow IPM practices from early stage of the crop to reduce the pest and disease incidence and crop loss.
