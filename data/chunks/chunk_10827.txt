   Free air movement should be there in the shed.   20-30% extra vitamins and trance minerals should beaded to feed.   Feed the birds during the cooler part of the day.   Supply of plenty of clean and cold water must be ensured.   Addition of 0.25% salt drinking water like sodium carbonate increase water consumption.   Increase frequency of watering.   Strict bio- security measures should follow in the farm.   Always consult a Veterinary Doctor/ State Dept. Doctors/ KVK Scientist for proper health care and management. Livestock   Follow good management practises related to feeding, housing (clean, dry, well ventilated) water and general hygiene to keep animal healthy   Observe animals for any abnormal behavior/posture/feed intake/ rumination/defecation and urination twice daily (morning and afternoon)   Restrict the movement of visitors to the farms and follow strict biosecurity procedures for poultry and animal farms   Deworm all animals and poultry for external and internal parasites in consultation with veterinary doctor or state Veterinary Dept. or KVK   Follow strict vaccination programmes for animal and birds. Vaccinate against Ranikhet, IBD, Fowl pox, Marek disease in poultry birds. In pig vaccinate against swine fever. Vaccination for FMD, BQ and HS for bovines. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 98   Regular supplementation of mineral mixtures @ 2kg/100kg feeds and common salt @ 1kg/ l00kg feeds.   Health care of sick animals should be done in consultation with local veterinarians/ KVK personnel. If medicines are not available use indigenous traditional knowledge for management of ailments. Soil Science Integrated Nutrient Management in Rice Nutrient components for INM Requirements per hectare Fertilizer Urea: 100 kg; DAP: 90 kg and MOP: 50 Biofertilizer (Azospirillum) 2-3 kg Manure (FYM/Compost) 30 – 40 tons For efficient fertilizer use   Use organic fertilizer (manure, compost, straw, husk, plant leaves) whenever possible especially in nurseries.   Apply all P, K, and 10% N evenly and incorporate just before seeding or transplanting. For direct seeded broadcast crops, it is okay to apply 10–14 days after establishment when there is water in the field.   Apply remaining N (urea) in 2 equal portions at 30 days and 50–60 days (panicle initiation) after emergence.   In established crops, apply chemical fertilizer only in standing water and evenly across the whole field.   Do not apply high rates of fertilizer for traditional varieties as they may have limited response and cause lodging.   Do not use chemical fertilizer if you need more than 5 kg paddy to pay for 1 kg of fertilizer.   Inorganic fertilizers must be stored in a dry and cool place that is out of children’s reach Water management   Water availability largely determines the potential crop yield. For a crop to continue to grow, the water supply needs to be similar or a little above evaporation.
