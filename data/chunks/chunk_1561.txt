 Climate resilient technologies for different climate vulnerabilities Climate extremes Climate resilient technologies Flood • Crop diversification with flood tolerant crops/ farming systems cultivation • Flood tolerant rice varieties like Swarna Sub-1, Ranjith Sub-1, Swarna Shreya • Transplanting of rice seedlings after recession of flood • Relay cropping of blackgram and toria in rice • Altering planting dates to avoid flood • Integrated farming systems (Rice-duck system) • Integrated farming systems (Rice–fish farming, scientific fish cultivation) • Shelter management in animals (mechang type and floating type shelter) Water- logged • Vegetable cultivation in floating beds • Cultivation of aquatic vegetables • Fish cultivation • Drainage and trench cum bunding • Raised bed and broad bed method of cultivation Salinity • Cultivation of salinity-tolerant rice varieties, salinity-resistant jute, peanut, sugarcane, kohlrabi, sweet potato, sesame, millet varieties • Practising rice-fish-vegetables cultivation in the same land • Crop through ditch and dyke, and raised bed, floating beds to avoid saline water flooding • Sulphur application @ 20 kg/ha • Green manuring and residue management Heat stress • Heat tolerant varieties • Protected cultivation • Shelter management for animals • Altering the sowing dates of kharif crops • Frequent irrigation through sprinklers • KNO3 spray @ 2% • Livestock breed upgradation (Sirohi goat, Kadaknath poultry breed) Drought • Cultivation of drought tolerant/ low water-requiring crops like millets • Water harvesting and use of the farm pond water for supplemental irrigation • Construction of Jalkunds for supplemental irrigation to crops • In situ moisture conservation through conservation furrows / Raised bed planting and mulching • Improving the feed and fodder for the animals Cold stress • Cold tolerant crops • Protected cultivation • Improved shelter management for livestock • Low tunnel vegetable nursery Natural resource management practices Climate change influences the intensity and distribution of rainfall during the monsoon season. Some regions may experience more intense and erratic rainfall, while others may have reduced precipitation. Higher rainfall intensity, often results in increased runoff. Furthermore, delay in the onset and early withdrawal of monsoon, is also observed. This affects the time of sowing and agricultural activities which in turn reduces the crop productivity. Rise in temperature increases evapotranspiration, which lead to more rapid depletion of soil moisture leading to higher water requirement. Projections suggest that 1°C rise in temperature could increase the crop water demand by 2% and overall water demand by 10%. Hence, efficient use of natural resources such as water and soil are highly critical for adaptation to climate change.
