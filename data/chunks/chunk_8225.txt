It can be grown under boro cultivation also. New Lr gene in wheat landrace: A unique leaf- rust resistant gene LrLWH in LWH 2 (Local Wheat Hango 2), a bread wheat landrace, was collected from Hango, higher hills of district Kinnaur, Himachal Pradesh. Molecular mapping of 172 F3 populations using 300 SSR revealed seven markers polymorphic to new gene. Mapping studies placed LrLWH in the short arm of chromosome 2D, about 6.7 cM proximal to the SSR marker gdm35, and cau96 and barc124, mapped at 1.9 cM and 2.5 cM, respectively, distal to LrLWH.
