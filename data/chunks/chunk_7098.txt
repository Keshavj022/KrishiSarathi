05 mm per generation, respectively, over the last 11 generations. A total of 2,053 chicks of PD-6 (S-10) were produced using 44 sires and 250 dams, which were selected for higher shank length at 6 weeks. In PD-2 line (S-16), the body weight, egg weight, egg production and egg mass up to 72 weeks of age were 2,728 g, 55.8 g, 138.6 eggs and 7,898 g, respectively. The egg mass showed improvement of 451 g over previous generation. The S-17 generation was reproduced utilizing 50 sires and 250 dams, which were selected for higher egg mass up to 52 weeks. In PD-3 line (S-8), the egg production and egg mass up to 40 weeks of age increased considerably from the previous generation. The heritability estimates for production traits were low to high from sire and dam components of variance. The PD- 3 line (S-9) was regenerated using 50 sires and 250 dams in a pedigreed mating. The body weight at 2, 4 and 6 weeks of age was 89.0, 202.8 and 341 g, respectively, in S-9 generation. The body weight improved from the last generation.

Body weight at 40 weeks increased (by 93 g in cocks and 45 g in hens) in the present generation along with shank length in cocks (by 0.4 mm). Egg weights also increased (by 2.95 g at 40 weeks). In Ghagus, an indigenous chicken breed, hen housed egg production (117.8 eggs) improved by 10.84 eggs. The egg weight and body weight at 72 weeks were 52.7 and 2,288 g, respectively. An improvement of 87.6 g in body weight and 3.59 mm in shank length was recorded at 8 weeks in this generation. In Nicobari chicken, improvement of 153 and 94 g in body weight and 1.6 and 1.58 mm in shank length were recorded in male and female birds, respectively. Hen day egg production (74.7) and egg mass (3,456 g) up to 40 weeks showed positive trend. The G-8 generation of Nicobari was produced (765 chicks).The heritability estimates of juvenile growth traits were moderate to high. In Kadaknath, body weight at 4 and 8 weeks was 124.4 and 403.7 g, respectively, which were higher than that in the previous generation. The age at sexual maturity was 176.
