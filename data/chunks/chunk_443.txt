0% increase over the population from last livestock census 2012 (Basic Animal Husbandry Statistics 2019). According to data from Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT), milk production was 209.96 million tonnes (MT) during 2020-21 against 198.44 MT in 2019-20. Indian Farming 73 (10): 14-16; October 2023 India accounted for 21% of the global output. The livestock sector has been growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.93% from 2014-15 to 2020-21. The percentage share of the livestock sector has increased from 24.38% in 2014-15 to 30.87% in 2020-21 in the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the agriculture and allied sector. India today is not only the global leading milk producer, but it has also become the largest consumer of cow milk (https://worldpopulationreview. com/country-rankings/milk- consumption-by-country). There is need to draw attention on negative energy balance and health disorders of dairy animal which eventually affect the loss of milk production. Dairy farmers and our field extension functionaries are not much aware about the prevention of the many diseases e.g. milk fever, acidosis, theliorasis and mastitis which are biggest threat to the dairy industry. Such efforts are being carried out in the Farmer FIRST programme and one of them has been presented in this article for the benefit of the dairy farmers and other end users. Ruminal acidosis: Milk production per cow/buffalo continues to increase 2.0 to 3.0% annually. Genetic improvements accounts for 33 to 40% of the increase, whereas feeding and management contributes the remaining 60 to 67% of the milk production. Fat & SNF Mobile testing Van Indian Farming 15 October 2023 Prepartum and postpartum period of dairy animals is a critical period. Therefore, nutrition is an important factor which has profound effects on all aspects of health, production and reproduction of dairy animals. Negative energy balance must be minimized by controlling proper nutrition in late lactation and optimum nutrition at each stage of the lactation cycle significantly improves health and fertility. Generally, dairy animals with high genetic potentials are required to be fed on maintained and high concentrate diets to fulfil their nutritional requirements. Suddenly changing the feed from fodder to concentrates of pregnant dairy animals leads to rumen acidosis. In rumen acidosis, the rumen pH comes down from 5.5 (normal 6.5 to 7.0) and this is not favourable for proper feed digestion (https://www. thecattlesite.com). At this pH, almost all rumen bacteria which helps in digestion die. Rumen acidosis can reduce weight gain drastically and severe condition may cause animalâ€™s death. This is necessary to maintain the stable ruminant environment which reduces the risk of rumen acidosis and allow dairy animals to achieve their full milk production potential (https://www.thecattlesite. com).
