 Specifically, in India, Karnataka stands out as one of the semid-arid regions, with 60.00% of its districts (18 of 30) located on the Deccan plateau, confronting the adverse impacts of drought conditions (Jayasree and Venkatesh, 2015). During 2018–2019, 64.99% of the total crop area in Karnataka was allocated to rainfed cultivation. This statistic data, despite challenging agro-ecological conditions, highlight the considerable dependence (49.28%) of the state’s entire workforce on agricultural activities (India Ministry of Home Affairs, 2011). Most landholders (76.44%) in Karnataka fall in the small and marginal farmer groups, holding an average land size of 1.55 hm2, which aligns with the broader trend observed in India. By examining the evolving landscape of population pressure on agricultural land in Karnataka, it becomes evident that from 2004–2005 to 2018–2019, the total net crop area has experienced a marginal increase of 1.65×105 hm2 (1.57%). In contrast, the total population surged by 15.69% between 2001 and 2011 (India Ministry of Home Affairs, 2011), posing a growing threat to both food security and livelihood sustainability. Given the ongoing challenges of persistent agricultural land scarcity and constrained possibilities for agricultural land expansion, it becomes imperative to prioritize the enhancement of agricultural efficiency. This is crucial to address the increasing demands of a growing population and attain food security. The prevailing literature focuses primarily on issues related to food security and productivity from an economic standpoint (Panth, 1997; Rao and Deshpande, 2002; Masiero and Prakash, 2015). However, the expansion of agricultural productivity and the judicious utilization of resources are markedly shaped by agricultural efficiency (Alzarliani et al., 2019), which is defined as the highest yield in agricultural land and is intricately linked to factors such as soil quality, climate conditions, and farming methodologies (Shafi, 1960). The augmentation of agricultural efficiency holds paramount importance for increasing food production, uplifting the income levels of small and marginal farmers, and enhancing their access to food (Gallup et al., 1997). To meet the demands of the burgeoning population in Karnataka, enhancing agricultural efficiency emerges as the most viable solution. Key factors such as fertile alluvial soil, the availability of irrigation water, and favorable climate play pivotal roles in boosting agricultural efficiency, vice versa (Shafi, 1960). Dayal (1984) and Toma et al. (2015) asserted that the connection between inputs and outputs, serving as a gauge of agricultural efficiency, plays a crucial role in determining agricultural productivity. Enhanced family well-being is a direct outcome of increased agricultural efficiency (Oshaug and Haddad, 2002). Family income, in turn, impacts agricultural efficiency, thereby impacting the overall family well-being.
