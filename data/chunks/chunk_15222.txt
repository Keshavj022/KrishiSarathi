Introduction Precision agriculture, also known as smart farming or preci- sion farming, has emerged as a transformative approach to modern agriculture, addressing the pressing global challenges of food security, environmental sustainability, and resource efﬁciency. With projections indicating that the global popula- tion will approach 10 billion by 2050, the need for food is predicted to rise signiﬁcantly. This will impose unparalleled challenges on agricultural systems to enhance production using restricted resources [1]. Conventional farming prac- tices, characterized by uniform treatments and practices across large ﬁelds, often result in inefﬁciencies and wastage of valuable resources such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides. Additionally, unpredictable weather patterns and the increas- ing threat of climate change pose additional uncertainties and Wiley Journal of Sensors Volume 2025, Article ID 2460098, 26 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/js/2460098 risks for farmers, making it essential to optimize agricultural operations to ensure long-term food production sustain- ability. In this context, precision agriculture stands out as an innovative method that utilizes advanced technologies, especially smart sensors and data analytics, enabling farm- ers to make informed decisions based on real-time informa- tion [2]. By incorporating smart sensors to monitor and analyzed speciﬁc aspects of crops, soil, and environmental conditions, precision agriculture empowers farmers to tailor inputs and interventions precisely to the needs of individual plants or areas of the ﬁeld. The potential beneﬁts of preci- sion agriculture are multifaceted. First, it offers the promise of signiﬁcantly increasing crop yields and overall produc- tivity while reducing resource wastage [3]. Second, by using resources more efﬁciently and minimizing environmental impacts, precision agriculture contributes to sustainable and responsible agricultural practices [4]. Third, the ability to anticipate and respond to changing environmental con- ditions improves resilience against climate variability, enhancing the sector’s ability to withstand challenges posed by global climate change. The adoption of smart sensor tech- nologies in modern agriculture holds paramount importance in revolutionizing the way we produce food and addressing the numerous challenges faced by the agricultural sector today [5].
