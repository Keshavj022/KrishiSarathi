, INS‐I‐2004‐1, 4, 8, 9, 12, AIS‐(R)‐2004‐2 recorded <30% damage of thrips as against more than 70% in other genotypes and six genotypes viz; INS‐I‐2004‐2, 7. AIS(R)‐ 2004‐1, 4, 5, 8 showed less than 10(% damage of Helicoverpa armigera as against 40‐46% in other genotypes. • Propiconazole (0.1%) and Difenaconazole (0.1 %) were found to be most effective and economical against LLS and rust for 3‐4 years at Aliyamagar and Vriddhachalam. • Integration of components viz. resistant variety (R 8808), spacing of 20 x 10 cm, groundnut + bajra intercropping (4:1), two foliar spray each of Phosphomidon (0.05%) and aqueous leaf extract of Sorghum (l 0%) at 20 and 30 DAS was found most effective in managing PBND at Kadiri and Raichur during three years of experimentation. This module was also found effective in managing PSND at Kadiri. • The genotypes, JB 1101 (21% damage) and VG 9816 (32.5% damage) showed less foliage damage by thrips (c. indicus) as against 85% damage in ICGV 86590 • For the control of major seed and seedling diseases, integration of deep tillage during summer and/or crop rotation with wheat and seed treatment with Trichoderma harzianum @ 4g/kg seed was found most effective and economical (BCR 1:1.58‐1 :1.79). • For control of stem rot, seed treatment with Captan (2 g / kg) followed by soil solarization + seed treatment with Trichoderma harzianum @4 g/kg of seed was found to be effective. • The cultures, CS‐168, CS 86, PBS 29058, CS 19 and CS‐160 possessed resistance against ELS; CS 168, CS 185 and PBS 12169 against LLS and CS 168, CS 151, CS 25, CS 19 and CS 157 against stem rot. The two genotypes, CS 168 and ICR 12 possessed promising multiple disease resistance. Six www.icar.org.in 42 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science NRCG breeding lines (NRCG 1 to 6) exhibited resistance to LLS and rust at the hotspot location (A1iyarnagar) of both these diseases • The genotypes PBS‐29071 and PBS‐14010 have shown high level of resistance to leaf hopper, and genotypes NRCG‐10628, 12698, 10818, ICG‐ 12367,12620,12621,9981,7846, 15119, 11721,2462,3037,4032,5403,9889,2701, 2748 and 4248 are found to be resistant to groundnut leaf miner under filed conditions under optimum disease pressure during the rainy season of 2004 • Based on three years data (2003, 2004, 2005) at Vriddhachalam, Hanumangarh, Latur and two years data at Raichur, soil application of FYM enriched formulation of Trichoderma sp. (T viride IT harzianum) was found most economical in managing the soil‐borne diseases (collar rot, stem rot, root rot, pod rot) in groundnut. At Dharwad, based on 3 years data, seed treatment with Trichoderma sp. @4g/kg seed was found most economical with CBR of 1:2.48. • At Jalgaon, based on 3 years data, it was revealed that the seed treatment with captan @ 3 g/kg seed gave highest ICBR of 56.39 in managing collar rot and stem rot. • At Junagadh, the seed treatment with mancozeb @ 3 g/kg seed was found most effective in managing collar rot disease.
