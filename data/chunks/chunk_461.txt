Application time Atrazine 50% WP Atrataf, Solaro 1.0-1.5 kg/ ha Pre-emergence at 1-2 DAS; broad spectrum herbicide but basically a broad-leaved killer, early post- emergence application within 2 weeks after emergence in maize Pyroxasulfon 85% WG Zidua (BASF) 127 g/ha Pre-emergence at 1-2 DAS; broader spectrum of control of small-seeded broadleaf weeds and grasses Pendimethalin 30% EC Stomp 1.0-1.5 litres/ha Pre-emergence at 1-2 DAS; broad spectrum but basically a grass killer herbicide Atrazine + Pendimethalin 0.75 + 0.75 kg/ha Pre-emergence at 1-2 DAS; tank mix application controls a broad spectrum of weeds Topramezone 33.6% SC Tynzer (BASF) 25 g/ha 25-30 DAS; post-emergence control of tough broadleaf weeds and grasses Tembotrione 42% SC Laudis (BAYER) 112 g/acre 25-30 DAS; broad spectrum post- emergence herbicide for control of broad leaf and grassy weeds Halosulfuron methyl 75% WG Sempra (Dhanuka) 36 g/acre 25-30 DAS; post-emergence control of sedges and other weeds Mesotrione 2.27% + Atrazine 22.7% SC Calarisxtra (SYNGENTA) 1400 ml/ acre 25-30 DAS; pre-mix herbicide application control grass weeds and broad leaf weeds Biological method It includes use of living organisms for suppressing or controlling the weeds. Bioherbicides are composed of phytopathogenic microorganisms or microbial/plant derived phytotoxins that offer effective biological weed control and can be applied using similar methods to chemical herbicides. Such micro- organisms are known as bio-agents which prefer weeds for food intake. Biological methods are costly and lot of investment is required for screening for desirable predator in maize (Table 2).
