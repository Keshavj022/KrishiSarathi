  Provision of airfare for CAFT participants may be considered to avoid low level of participants by faculty; such measure will solve the problem of last minute drop-outs; this may also motivate the faculty of SAUs and AUs even from interior and far-flung areas.  More visits to the experimental and farmers‟ fields may be included; adequate provision for such visits may be included in the budget for CAFT programmes. Sessions for practical exposures and demonstrations must be adequately included; afternoon sessions may be planned with practical and hands-on experiences and demonstration sessions and theory-based interaction sessions may be scheduled during morning hours.
