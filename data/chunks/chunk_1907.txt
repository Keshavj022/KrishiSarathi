 “Wave Bluetooth Sensors and actuators (Source: Keysight technologies) Figure 5: loT Architecture loT devices typically utilize wireless communication technologies, although they may also be connected via wireline. Some of the examples of the loT devices may include smart camera, smart watch, smart meters, tracking devices etc. loT gateways may include POS machines, smart phones, Wi- Fi routers etc. Further, the data collected from loT devices is transferred to the cloud either directly or through an loT gateway for storage and analysis purpose, for taking informed decisions. 3https://tec.gov.in/pdf/M2M/Emerging%20Communication%20Technologies%20&%20Use%20Cases%20inN%2010T% 20domain.pdf TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 7 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 8 2.1. Cellular Technologies 2.1.1. Evolution of Cellular Technologies Figure 6: Evolution of Cellular Technologies4 The GSM standard originally described a digital, circuit-switched network optimized for full duplex voice telephony. This expanded over time to include data communications, first by circuit-switched transport, then by packet data transport via General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE). 2G networks developed as a replacement for first generation (1G) analog cellular networks. Subsequently, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) developed third-generation (3G) UMTS standards, followed by the fourth-generation (4G) LTE Advanced and the fifth-generation 5G standards. The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) was a 3rd generation wireless telecommunication system. UMTS combined the properties of the circuit-switched voice network with the properties of the packet-switched data network and offered a multitude of new possibilities compared to the earlier systems. Some of the key features of UMTS (3G) were enhanced data transfer rates, wider bandwidth, supporting wide range of multimedia services. High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) and HSPA+ were introduced in 3GPP Release 5 and 7 which significantly increased the data rate. 4https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Timeline-of-Mobile-communication-generations-27_fig2_349740908 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report 2.1.
