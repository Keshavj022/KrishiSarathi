 At present, these cakes are either utilized as animal is useful for transporting fish in live condition for marketing at premium price. Live fish carrier system (LFCS) is an electric tri- cycle based live fish transportation system for short and medium distance (about 80 km) transportation of fish including the table carps (rohu, catla, mrigal, common carp, grass carp, silver carp, bighead carp) in live condition from one place to another for marketing, rearing, ornamental displaying and breeding purposes. It is devised with water filtration, aeration and cooling system providing good quality water to reduce fish mortality while transportation. It can travel a distance about 60-80 km with maximum speed of 25 km/h with total carrying capacity of 500 kg (200 kg fish + 200 kg water + 100 kg driver etc.). The invented new system reduces fish mortality to less than 5% for a journey period of about 4-5 hours. The system is convenient to handle fish by single person whereas 4- 5 labours/trip are required in traditional method. The complete system costs ` 2.0 lakh. Fish Conditioning-cum-Storage Tank Fish conditioning cum storage tank of 200 litre capacity has been developed for storing fish harvested from culture ponds and marketing of live fish in the market. The dissolved oxygen was maintained at levels of 3.0-6.0 mg/litre by continuous aeration. The dissolved free ammonia was observed to be below 1.3 ppm at a pH near 7.0 and water temperature of 18.6-25°C. The water renewal was 25% every 12 h. A total fish load of 100 kg/container of Indian major carps (rohu, catla, mrigal) and two Chinese carps (bighead carp and silver carp) of mean size (length) 25-40 cm and weight 0.36-0.78 kg was tested for survival. 95% fish survived after storage for 48 hours. The storage tank is mounted on a trolley for easy mobility. Development of Portable Coconut Fibre Strength Tester The tensile strength of coconut, sisal, and nylon fibres of different linear densities can be tested by this instrument. The instrument can test up to a load of 980N (10kg) at a test speed up to 50 mm/min. The Live fish carrier system Protein isolate pilot plant developed at ICAR-CIPHET feed or being exported to other countries like China and Malaysia. Protein-isolate from these de-oiled cakes (rich in protein) can be incorporated into food products to combat protein malnourishment. Live Fish Carrier System This technology developed at CIPHET, Ludhiana Fish conditioning-cum-storage tank trolley DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 90 POST-HARVEST MANAGEMENT AND VALUE-ADDITION DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 91 dimensions of the instrument are 320 mm (width) × 200 mm (depth) × 510 mm (height) and weight is approximately 16.0 kg. Since, coconut fibre is hard, gripping during tensile loading is a problem. This problem has been addressed by using hide for gripping the sample during testing.
