With the support and guidance of Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), farmers like Shri Indra Bdr. Chettri successfully cultivated this semi-scented, high-yielding variety, achieving a yield of 38.5 q/ha and substantial income gains. The KVK organized training, demonstrations, and awareness programs that introduced farmers to sustainable practices such as seed treatments with Trichoderma viridis to enhance crop protection. The success of the initial trials inspired other farmers to adopt Palam Basmati, leading to increased demand and government-supported seed distribution. This initiative underscores the potential for organic Basmati rice to enhance the socio-economic well-being of farmers in Sikkim through sustainable and profitable agriculture. Keywords: Basmati, High-yielding, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Paddy, Palam Basmati 01, Organic, Rice, Sikkim, Sustainable agriculture S IKKIM is an organic state where ecological principles of organic cultivation for crop management are followed. Organic farming focuses on achieving agro-eco systems which are socially acceptable and ecologically sustainable. Basmati occupies a special status in rice cultivation and Palam Basmati 01 (or HPR- 2612) is a semi-scented basmati rice which contains organoleptic characteristics with taste and aroma that can be easily cooked and palatable. This variety is suitable for cultivation upto 1,000 m above from sea level. In the financial year 2018-19, India exported around 4.4 million tonnes of Basmati rice worth USD 4.7 billion. Whereas, comparably if we look at non-Basmati rice, our country generated USD 3 billion despite exporting 7.5 million tonnes, which is almost double the amount of Basmati rice exported. It is clearly understandable that the importance of Basmati Rice production in our country as well as in Sikkim is more profitable than non-Basmati rice. Implementation and support Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Gyaba, has been playing a major role in uplifting livelihood status of farmers in agriculture and allied sectors.
