 Impact of Nutrient Management on Soil Productivity The long-term application of FYM alone (since 1956) to maize-wheat in acidic red soil at Kanke, Ranchi (Jharkhand), has produced significantly higher yields of crops compared to application of 100% recommended NPK. The yields of maize and wheat were 3.115 and 3.350 tonnes/ha in the former treatment compared to 1.688 and 2.580 tones/ha in the latter treatment became comparable with organic treatment for maize when it was supplemented with lime. The yields of wheat under NPK + lime were significantly higher over organic treatment. Organic manure addition increased soil pH and organic carbon content in the soils. With the addition of lime along with chemical fertilizers, there was increase in soil pH but organic carbon content remained low. Therefore, both liming and organic manuring along with balanced chemical fertilization could be the right proposition for better management of acid soils to sustain high productivity. The addition of lime and FYM are, therefore, crucial for sustainable management of acid soils.

Tracking Inoculated Bacteria in Soil Methods for assessing the survival of inoculated diazotrophs—Azospirillum and Azotobacter—in soil were standardized using stable genetic markers lac Z and gus A. Inoculated Azospirillum lipoferum strains Cd and S-28 marked with lac Z survived in the rhizosphere of wheat up to 120 days. However, lac Z + strain of other heterotrophic soil bacteria were also present in the soil and thus did not provide a specific assay. Since lac Z is non-specific and gus A assays are expensive, using ‘gfp’ (green fluorescent protein) marker combined with tetracycline marker was found more useful for ecological studies as it was stably integrated. Bradyrhizobium sp. nodulating greengram was marked with gfp and identified in soil, nodule and charcoal-based inoculant. l The rhizobial populations in the fields constantly cultivated with same legume crop are very low. Therefore, legume inoculation of rhizobial and other bacterial biofertilizers should be practised by the farmers every year. l The vermicompost prepared from sugarcane trash, pressmud, poultry waste and soybean straw contained 30–40% higher nitrogen compared to the compost prepared by heap or pit methods.
