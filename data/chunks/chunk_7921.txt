 Nutrient use in terms of N, P, and K and extent of adoption of HYVs were furnished for model districts also to explore scope for bridging the yield gap in those lines. Decision support system for white fly in cotton: A weather-based decision support system for white fly in cotton was developed by AICRPAM, Ludhiana centre, PAU for Punjab. Favourable weather conditions identified for the pest are: heavy rainfall > 50 mm, T max (32-39 oC), T min (22-28 oC), Morning relative humidity (73-90%) and evening relative humidity (38- 63%). Diversification of rice-wheat system: A salt tolerant variety (CS58) of Indian mustard was developed for cultivation under moderate to high soil salinity and alkalinity conditions in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi and Rajasthan (North Western Plain Zone) with high seed yield and oil content. It produces seed yield of 2.0-2.2 tonnes/ha under saline and 2.6-2.8 tonnes/ ha under normal conditions, about 25% higher than high-yielding control variety. during rabi, two pulses (chickpea and lentil) and three oilseeds (mustard, linseed, and safflower) were superimposed on kharif treatments with crop resides management, i.e. retaining 30% residue and without residues. Among establishment methods, maximum yield was recorded with ZTDSR compared to ZTTP and CTTP. The ZT-DSR recorded significantly higher seed yield (1348.8 kg/ha), rice equivalent yield (3656.3 kg/ha) and system rice equivalent yield (6226.3 kg/ha). In residues management, significantly higher seed yield (1049.1 kg/ha) was recorded with residues retention of 30%. The highest rice equivalent yield (3271.2 kg/ ha) and system rice equivalent yield (5799.3 kg/ha) were recorded with chickpea as compared to rest of the crops. Diversification of rice-wheat system through climate resilient cropping in Eastern India New varieties: Two varieties of Cenchrus ciliaris, CAZRI 358 and CAZRI 2178 and one variety of Lasiurus sindicus (CAZRI Sewan-1) were recommended for release. CAZRI Sewan-1 has an average green fodder yield of 156.8 q/ha which recorded 2.7 per cent higher than the overall mean (152.7 q/ ha). Frequency in a group of top three genotypes was high (8/11) than the overall mean (5/11) for green forage yield. At Jodhpur (2014-2016), this selection produced 61.9 q green forage yield which was 29.0 per cent more than the general mean (48.0 q/ha). Likewise, genotypes recorded 29.1 per cent more dry matter yield than general mean (19.9 q/ha). Rice establishment methods: Three rice establishment methods, viz. zero-till direct-seeded rice (ZT-DSR), ZT transplanting (ZT-TP) and conventional (puddle) transplanting (CT-TP) were evaluated during kharif 2016. The ZT DSR recorded maximum rice yield (5.14 tonnes/ha), followed by CT (5.05 t/ha) and ZT (3.89 tonnes/ha), respectively. In similar set Wealth from waste Lac mud is the waste product of lac processing industries which is about 2.5â€“4.5% on dry and wet weight basis, respectively, of the raw material (sticklac) processed.
