 This in­ crease reflects the growing realization of the importance of research related to the impact of climate change on resilience and sus­ tainability in the agriculture sector across different countries, including India. This might be due to the repeated occurrence of drought, flood, cyclone, unseasonal rainfall, and an increase in temperature in various parts of the world and in India. Efforts to achieve climate- resilient agriculture have been initiated both at the national and state level. For example, at the national level, the National Innovations Table 1 Key information about the dataset.

Baraj et al. Heliyon 10 (2024) e29586 5 on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) in India under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) was established in 2011 in this direction. Various State Governments have also initiated special projects on climate-resilient agriculture, such as the Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture (PoCRA) implemented by the Government of Maharashtra and World Bank to achieve climate-resilient agriculture in the Vidharbha and Marthwada region of Maharashtra [29]. In terms of total citations (TC), the most cited articles were published in 2018 (TC = 962) and 2015 (TC = 1920), indicating that these publications significantly shaped this domain. The increase in publications in recent years might be due to heightened awareness about issues related to CCRASAI. Furthermore, the United Nations Climate Change Conferences held in Paris in 2015, Bonn in 2017, and most recently in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt in 2022, likely fostered increased interest and commitment towards climate change research. The paper titled “Mapping vulnerability to multiple stressors: Climate change and globalization in India” by O’Brien et al. [30] garnered the highest number of citations. Published in 2004, it likely garnered more citations because it provided a systematic methodology to study the regional variation of vulnerability due to climate change from multiple stressors. The vulnerability analysis is also helpful in preparing and implementing government policies and interventions, both by government and non-government agencies, to achieve climate resilience. 3.2. Most influential authors The dataset was analyzed to identify the most productive authors based on their publication count. Table 2 presents the top 10 most productive authors, alongside the number of citations received and their Hirsch index (h-index) for each.
