English name Botanical name Active ingredients Soft hemp, true hemp Cannabis sativa Linn. Cannabis is cultivated for its narcotic resin, fibre and seed. But the plants cultivated for fibre and seed are not used simultaneously for extracting the narcotic resin. The hilly areas are more suitable for the cultivation of the fibre and seed crop, whereas the arid areas are ideal for the crop yielding the narcotic drugs. The seeds from the seed crop are sent to the areas where the crop is grown for the drugs.
