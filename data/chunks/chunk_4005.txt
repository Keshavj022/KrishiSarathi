Future Prospects This intervention is very promising for effective management of red spider mite and to maximize the productivity and income of the farmers. The acaricides found effective in management of red spider mite in brinjal in Dehradun region of Uttarakhand have great significance in national perspective because brinjal is such a vegetable which is grown around the year throughout the country and incidence of red spider mite has emerged as most devastating pest. Hence, in the present scenario of brinjal cultivation, management of red spider mite has become very challenging for the farmers in which recommendation investigated in the studies and highlighted in the paper will help the farming community in effective, economical and environmental management of red spider mite. Incidence of red spider mite in brinjal Same damaged crop after intervention Close view of red spider mite Scientist and field worker monitoring the crop Damaged crop before intervention Brinjal production in demonstrated crop Indian Horticulture 48 SUMMARY The impact of technological interventions particularly introduction of Chaya and Shamli hybrids, management of red spider mite by timely and judicious application of acaricides namely hexythiazox 1ml per liter of water + propargite 1ml per liter of water+ Sticker 0.5 ml per liter of water at 10 days interval in brinjal crops significantly improved the production, productivity, profitability and sustainability in agri-horticultural production systems in Vikasnagar block of Dehradun district of Uttarakhand. The survey, trainings and demonstrations conducted during 2015 to 2019 encouraged the farmers towards commercial brinjal cultivation. According to an estimate, about 70% increment in yield was recorded under brinjal cultivation which is remarkable impact achieved due to technological intervention particularly introduction of high yielding hybrids and effective management of red spider mite.
