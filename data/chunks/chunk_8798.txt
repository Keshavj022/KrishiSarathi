One hundred and eighty-two samples have been exported to 12 countries. Inland supply comprised 14,684 samples. Plant Quarantine Out of the total of 53,922 samples for quarantine clearance, 41,229 were imported and the rest have been exported. One thousand two hundred and forty-nine samples were infested with insects/mites; 121 were infected/contaminated with nematodes and 364 were infected with plant pathogens. Over 1,600 samples were salvaged. Paddy samples, totalling to 5,267, were given mandatory hot-water treatment. Phytosanitary certificates, 178 in number, were issued for consignments meant for export. A total of 6,628 samples of exotic germplasm were grown in Post-Entry Quarantine Glasshouse/Nursery. Pea seed-borne mosaic virus in EC 455038, EC 455042 from Syria and EC 454029 from Nepal has been confirmed.
