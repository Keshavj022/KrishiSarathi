Mahanga Block in Cuttack district of Odisha was selected as the study village for participatory seed production as it was already there in place. The data was analysed for seed production, seed processing and seed marketing using Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threat (SWOT) analysis and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. Firstly, strength, weakness, opportunities and threat regarding seed production, seed processing and seed marketing were enlisted by farmers. Then the statements were prioritised using AHP method. Top three factors for seed production, seed processing and seed marketing were identified. Based on these factors ‘IT enabled Self- sufficient Seed System for Rice (4S4R)’ model had been developed. FPC is central to this local seed system model. In case of seed production, it was found that Strengths: Availability of suitable irrigated and fertile land for seed production (0.219) and Farmers had basic knowledge about seed production (0.117) and Weakness: Labour problem during peak hour (0.134) were top three factors affecting seed production. Whereas in case of seed processing, it was observed that Strengths: Technical know-how for purification (0.398) and facility for initial processing like threshing and winnowing (0.168) and Weakness: Lack of proper covered threshing floor (0.128) were top three factors affecting seed processing. While in case of seed marketing, the Strengths: Production of quality seed and suitable appropriate variety as per requirement of the locality (0.324) and can provide seed at a cheaper rate than the market price (0.114) and Weakness: Lack of storage facility (0.143) were top three factors affecting seed marketing. As explained earlier, a model for local seed system was developed by NRRI-ABI Centre and five Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) were registered under Company Act, 2013. The Centre supported off-campus incubation of these five FPCs in five different blocks of Cuttack.
