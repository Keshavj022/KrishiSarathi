Spikes are the reproductive organs of wheat plants. Developed an online platform, “Web-SpikeSegNet (http:// spikesegnet.iasri.res.in),” based on a deep-learning framework for spike detection and counting from the wheat plant’s visual images and digital image analysis. As spike detection and counting in wheat phenotyping are closely related to the yield, “web- SpikeSegNet” is a significant step forward in the field of wheat crop yield phenotyping and can be extended to the other cereal crops.
