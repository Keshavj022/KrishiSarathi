 ICARDA has introduced several thousand landraces, wild species and newly developed breeding lines to India of the above crops and shared with its partner institutes. Pre-breeding research on lentil and Kabuli chickpea using wild relatives has generated promising genotypes with combination of desirable traits, which are under field trials. Using ICARDA-supplied germplasm, 10 lentil varieties have been released: NDL-1, Moitree, DPL-62, DPL-58, IPL406, IPL-316, IPL- 526, VL-507, L-4717 and VL-514). Identification and development of improved plant type of lentil rich in micro-nutrients (Fe and Zn) for short-season environments are in progress. Pusa Vaibhav, a high-iron lentil variety (102ppm) has been disseminated to farmers of Bihar & MP. In Kabuli chickpea, 6 varieties have been released: Virat-Phule G 95418, Vihar-Phule G 95311, Pusa 1108, Pusa 1053, Pusa 5023 and GLK 28127. Further 17 lines having high level of Ascochyta blight resistance are in field evaluation for future release. In barley, nine barley varieties have been released for food, feed and malt purposes in partnership with IIWBR. To enhance fodder availability, 67 spineless Cactus varieties have been introduced from Brazil and Italy and several nurseries have been developed. A total of 17,500 cladodes have been supplied to farmers in Janshi and Karnataka. Besides, promising lines of durum and bread wheat, grasspea and faba bean have enriched diversity for several traits including biotic and abiotic stress resistance. Up-scaling of lentil, grasspea and Kabuli chickpea have been done in 10 states covering rice-fallows, and appropriate varieties and production technologies have been adopted by farmers. Mapping of rice-fallows is in progress in West Bengal and Odisha. 2.ii. Contribution during last one year Based on requirements of genetic materials and requests from various partners, the following number of accessions were introduced in India during last one year-Kabuli Chickpea-1064; Grasspea-129; Lentil-1629; Faba bean-234; Barley-2100; Durum wheat-685; bread wheat-2781; and the total is: 8622. Besides, 2400 barley, 1434 lentil and 150 Vicia sp. were introduced as special nursery. Spine-less cactus in farmers’ field in Karnataka introduced from Italy Lentil Variety “Moitree” in rice-fallows in West Bengal ICAR-CGIAR Agricultural Cooperation 19 Crop-specific crosses were commissioned using Indian parents, and segregating populations have been shared with partner institutions. Seven Stemphylium blight resistant accessions, 19 rust resistant lines and 3 Ascochyta blight resistant cultures of lentil and 5 Fusarium wilt and Aschochyta blight resistant Kabuli chickpea lines have been selected. 11 lentil and 3 Kabuli chickpea lines developed from ICARDA genetic materials are in AICRP to test under varying climatic conditions 6,000 cladodes of spineless cactus have been distributed to farmers in Karnataka.
