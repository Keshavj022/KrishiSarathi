 The remaining 24% cases had either anorexia (12%) or inappetance (12%) (Fig. 8). Dung Characteristics: In sapota group (Fig. 4) the dung was loose in 32% cases and watery in 68% cases. It was foul smelling in 36% cases. In jackfruit group, the dung was loose in 60% cases and watery in 40% cases. Foul smelling was Table 3.

Dung characteristics monocyte and eosinophil were 3920 ą 351/ ml 5445 ą 382 / ml , 230 ą 56 / ml and 242 ą 56 /ml , respectively. The total and absolute differential leucocyte counts of diarrhoeic animals of sapota and jack did not differ significantly from normal values of control group (Table 1). The serum electrolytes like sodium, potassium and chloride in the Jack group were 97.81ą7.52 mmolitre, 3.49 ą 0.13 mmolitre and 92.62 ą 2.38 mmolitre respectively. Though the levels were decreased than normal values of control group, there was no significant difference except with potassium (Table 2). The leucogram and serum electrolytes recorded before and after treatment of jackfruit leaves group did not differ significantly.However, the decreased serum electrolyte levels (when compared with normal values of control group) noted during diarrhoea were found to have raised and approached normal value, recorded in the control group (Table 3). Though astringent action for the ITKs used in this validation trial could not be traced though the literature, the action could be attributed to the availability of latex or gum in the plants, sapota or jackfruit tree.
