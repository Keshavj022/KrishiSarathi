 Total operating time required for carbonization of selected crop residues ranges from 84 to 104 min. The average operating temperature of the biochar kiln is 296, 254, 269 and 256°C for wheat husk, maize stalk, maize cob and rice husk, respectively. Biochar produced from wheat husk in the biochar kiln has available nitrogen (5.8 g/kg), available phosphorus (3.5 g/kg), available potassium (92.2 g/kg), phosphorus (10.7 g/kg), cation-exchange capacity (78 cmol/kg), water-holding capacity (71%) and bulk density (0.55 g/cm3). The operational cost of biochar production by the biochar kiln is 78 for wheat husk, 100 for maize stalk, 54 for maize cob and 77/kg for rice husk. Cost for fabrication was approx 10,000. Mechanization and Energy Management icar annual report 2022-23 128 cost, 75% labour and 30–35% seed as compared to the traditional practice. Tractor-operated two-row forward-reverse rotavator for sugarcane crop A tractor-operated two-row forward-reverse rotavator for sugarcane crop was developed. It is also useful for making deep furrows for sugarcane planting operation. In forward direction, it is used for weeding, however, in reverse direction, earthing up is performed. Field coverage is usually less in such type of forward- reverse rotavator, particularly for making deep furrows for sugarcane planting and for inter-culture operation in sugarcane crop during initial growth period of the crop. The field trials were conducted in sugarcane field at Kagal, district Kolhapur and CAAST project field at Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Rahuri, Maharashtra. The total area covered was 33.4 ha with 81% field efficiency. This machine is very useful for saving time, money and reducing drudgery over conventional method. Tractor-front mounted hydraulic operated pruner A small tractor-mounted hydraulic pruner for orchards was developed due to unavailability of suitable indigenous tractor-mounted pruner. Height of cut and the angle of inclination of the blade gangs can be adjusted with hydraulic cylinders for proper cutting and giving shape to the canopy. The pruner can prune the plant up to a height of 3.5 m. The hydraulic system is designed to rotate the blades at about 2500 rpm. The system was been evaluated at ICAR-CIAE, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh farms of mango orchard. The pruner is able to cut the branches in the range of 3 to 65 mm at a forward speed of 1.2 km/h. Field capacity and fuel consumption of the pruner were 0.24 ha/h and 3.5 L/h, respectively. The pruning capacity of machine is 120 plants/h. The overall cost and operating cost of the pruner is ₹4,50,000 and ₹4,910/ha, respectively. SPAD meter 2.0 ICAR-CIAE has developed a low-cost alternative, i.e. the ICAR-CIAE SPAD meter 2.0. It measures the optical density difference at two wavelengths of 655 nm and 950 nm to calculate SPAD values for crops such as rice, wheat, maize, etc. with leaves up to 1 mm thickness.
