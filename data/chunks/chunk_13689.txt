05 between the mean was done by Duncan’s multiple range test using SAS version 9.3. 3. Results 3.1. Total soil organic carbon concentration in bulk soils Significant impacts of land uses on total SOC were observed in all three depths. Under native forest land use (NF), total SOC was signifi­ cantly higher than all other five land uses in the 0–15 and 15–30 cm soil layers. Soils under NF had 124, 70, 36%, 67% and 127% more total SOC than agri-horticulture (AH), native grassland (NG), rice-wheat system (RW), rice-vegetable system (RV) and maize-wheat system (MW), respectively, in the surface soil layer (0–15 cm depth) (Table 2). Soils under RW had 66% more total SOC than soils under MW (Table 2), indicating rice-based system had more potential for C sequestration in the 0–15 cm layer. In the subsurface layer (15–30 cm depth), NF had significantly higher total SOC than all other land uses. In the 30–45 cm layer, soils under NF and AH showed no significant differences between them in terms of total SOC. Interestingly in this layer, AH showed 34% and 51% higher total SOC concentration than NG and RV, respectively, implying that agri-horticulture impacted deep SOC in the region. 3.2. Soil organic C stock Soils under NF had significantly higher SOC stock (26.90 Mg ha−1) in the 0–15 cm depth than all other land uses. Whereas, the least amount of SOC stock was observed under MW system at 0–15 cm depth (11.98 Mg ha−1). Surface (0–15 cm) soils under RW had 49% higher total SOC stock than AH (Table 2). Interestingly, surface soils under RW had 68% more organic C stock (20.15 Mg ha−1) than MW. However, RW, RV and NG land uses had similar total SOC stocks in the soil surface. In the deeper layers, land use didn’t show any significant effect on SOC stocks. The NF had highest SOC stocks on ESM basis across the soil depths. The value under NF plots was ~27–56%, higher compared with the values in the other systems at 0–15 cm soil depth, respectively (Table 3). The RW system had significantly higher SOC stocks on ESM basis compared with NG, AH, RV and MW in the 0–15 cm soil depth. In the 15–30 and 30–45 cm soil layers, these systems did not register any significant differences in SOC stocks on ESM basis. 3.3. Microbial biomass carbon in bulk soil The effect of land use in both soil layers was significant on microbial biomass carbon (MBC, μg g−1 dry soil). In the surface layer (0–15 cm), soils under NF had highest MBC (661.91 μg g−1 dry soil) (Fig. 1a). However, in the subsurface layer, soils under NF showed least MBC (305.81 μg g−1 dry soil). In the 0–15 cm layer, soils under AH had 63% higher MBC and in the 15–30 cm layer 33% more MBC than RW. In the 15–30 cm layer, soils under AH had significantly more MBC than NF, NG and MW land uses (Fig. 1b). 3.4. Soil aggregation In the surface (0–15 cm), soils under NF had significantly more macroaggregates than RW land use (Table 4). Soils under RV had 17% more macroaggregates than RW in the surface layer (0–15 cm).
