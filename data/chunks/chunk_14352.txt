 However, it would be interesting to mention that atmospheric CO2 is increasing at about half the rate of fossil fuel emissions, implying that the remaining CO2 is either being fixed by terrestrial ecosystems or getting dissolved in the seawater (Heinze et al., 2015). Yet, the conditions worsen due to land-use changes (mainly deforestation) and conventional agricultural practices (i.e., fertilizer application). For instance, the application of chemical fertilizers leads to the release of more carbon from soils as CO2, which has also made the agricultural systems an important anthropogenic source for atmospheric CO2 (Chai et al., 2019). It has also been reported that conventional organic fertilizers like compost and farmyard manure increase the emission of CO2 from soil under high soil moisture conditions (Brenzinger et al., 2018). Nevertheless, Case et al. (2014) has indicated that stable carbon alternatives like biochar can reduce the soil CO2 emissions, but its feasibility under high soil moisture conditions needs close monitoring and thus demands further investigation. Satellite observation is a reliable technique to monitor the changes of trace gases in the atmosphere. However, the studies carried out over India in the last two decades demand keen analyses to understand the role of anthropogenic sources and natural sinks of CO2 over India (Nayak et al., 2011; Preethi et al., 2011; Tiwari et al., 2011, 2013; Nalini et al., 2018; Gupta et al., 2019). Ground-based observations of CO2 are of much importance in understanding the role of anthropogenic sources like agricultural activities. Although, a few ground-based observations of atmospheric CO2 are reported over the Himalaya and western India, but their observation period is very short (Anthwal et al., 2009; Sharma et al., 2014; Mahesh et al., 2016). Traditionally, ambient CO2 concentration monitoring is usually based on observations from ground stations spanning around the world. For instance, the global average monthly CO2 concentration above 400 ppm was measured in 2015 (March–May) at Mauna Loa (direct atmospheric CO2 measuring station), which also holds the longest CO2 measurement record available (Dlugokencky and Tans, 2015). These atmospheric measurements are accurate and thus capture even a small variation in atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Le Quere et al., 2009). However, such field measurements are limited (Gurney et al., 2002; Boesch et al., 2011) and therefore, the alternative way is to use satellite measurements. Prasad et al. (2014) presented the annual and seasonal variation in CO2 concentration over India using GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) data for two years (2009–2011) and compared it with SCIAMACHY (Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography) CO2 data. Similarly, Gupta et al. (2019) presented the seasonal and interannual variability of CO2 over India using nine years of AIRS data from 2003 to 2011.
