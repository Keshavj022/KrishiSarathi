Kar et al. Geoderma Regional 32 (2023) e00616 9 parameters increased simultaneously. Additionally, storage of SOM along the soil profile was significantly (p < 0.001) related to the SR (Fig. 7(b) and 7(c)). With the increase in SR, the storage of SOC (R2 = 0.46 and p-value <0.001) and TN (R2 = 0.36 and p-value <0.001) along the soil profile increased significantly. This resulted in a concurrently growing trend in SR and SOM along the soil profile (Tables 1 and 2). It suggests that the SR might serve as a reliable index of SOM storage along the soil profile. Several other researchers reported a similar correlation among SR, SOM, and MWD (Zhao et al., 2015; Chao et al., 2019; Patra et al., 2019a). 3.4. Soil quality assessment by CPI The CPI index was used to monitor the impact of soil disturbance and residue incorporation on soil quality improvement with respect to a reference site, and the outcomes are depicted in Fig. 8. The loss of C from a land use with higher CPI is of less consequences in comparison to the same amount of C loss from a land use having lower CPI (Blair et al., 1995). Hence the state of land degradation can be assessed from the CPI values of respective land uses (Bayer et al., 2009). As shown in Fig. 8, the CPI value increases significantly with an increase in soil depth for three land uses. Additionally, the CPI follows the same trend for each soil depth as for SOC storage: ZT > RT > CT. It indicates that the CPI value decreases with an increase in soil mechanical disturbance level. Simi­ larly, for a humid subtropical region in Southern Brazil, the CPI followed linearly with SOC stock, and higher CPI values were observed for low grazing intensity area (0.79 ± 0.01) than higher grazing intensity area (0.75 ± 0.01) (da Silva et al., 2014). The ZT and RT have significantly higher CPI values than CT up to 15 cm soil depth; beyond that, there are no significant differences among them. The CPI of ZT and RT are respectively 57% and 34% higher than CT. The higher CPI value for CA than CT is attributed to higher SOC storage with deeper depth (da Silva et al., 2014). As the CPI value is sensitive toward aggradation or degradation of SOC (Bayer et al., 2009; de Oliveira Ferreira et al., 2013; Stavi et al.
