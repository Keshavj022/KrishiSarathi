 Vivek Maize Hybrid 57, a high yielding single-cross normal corn hybrid (6,766 kg/ha, 95–100 days) was released and notified for Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand (Hills) and NE Hill Region. The variety is moderately resistant to Turcicum and Maydis leaf blight. VL Gehun 967, a wheat variety, that matures in 160–170 days and yields 18–20 q/ha, was released and notified for timely sown organic rainfed conditions of Uttarakhand hills. Wheat variety VL Gehun 2014, which yields 50–52 q/ha and matures in 130–135 days, was released and notified for timely sown irrigated conditions of Uttarakhand Plains. VL Gehun 3004, matures in 120–123 days and yields 40–45 q/ha, was released and notified for late sown irrigated conditions of Uttarakhand plains. All these varieties are resistant to yellow and brown rust diseases. VLB 130, a dual purpose barley variety with yield and maturity of 18–20 q/ha and 150–155 days, respectively, was released and notified for organic rainfed conditions of Uttarakhand hills. It is resistant to yellow rust and stripe rust diseases. A soybean variety VL Soya 89 with yield and maturity of 2,324 kg/ha and 115–120 days, respectively, was released and notified for timely sown rainfed condition of Northern Hill Zone (Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh). Two varieties of garden pea were released and notified for Uttarakhand hills. VL Sabji Matar 13, an early maturing (124–125 days) variety has average green pod yield 115 q/ha. At maturity, it escapes incidence of powdery mildew disease. VL Sabji Matar 15 is a medium maturing variety (126–130 days), with average green pod yield 128.10 q/ha. The variety is moderately resistant to powdery mildew disease. Both varieties have long pods and high shelling percentage (46–50%). Early sowing of irrigated wheat: Optimization of sowing dates for irrigated wheat in mid-hill region of Uttarakhand to adjust to changing rainfall pattern indicated that when the expected rainfall for the entire season is about half of the normal, sowing by October 25 gives maximum yield. When the expected rainfall is near normal, sowing around the first week of November is ideal. Yield loss of 28 kg grain/ha/day for sowing during the second fortnight of November is estimated in the same region.
