High dietary fibre and low in tannin content Variety Salient features CROP IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 52 Varieties developed through use of genomic resources: Six varieties of different cereal and pulse crops, viz. wheat (PBW 771), maize [Pusa HQPM-5 Improved (APQH 5), Pusa Vivek Hybrid-27 Improved (APH 27), Pusa HQPM-7 Improved (APQH 7)] and chickpea [Pusa Chickpea 10216 (BGM 10216), Super Annigeri-1 (MABC-WR-SAI)] have been developed through genomic assisted selection. These varieties have been improved by introgression of traits for quality, disease and drought tolerance. Use of genomic approach for herbicide tolerance and quality improvement: Marker-assisted backcross breeding was employed to transfer a herbicide tolerance mutant allele of ALS gene from Robin, an Imazethapyr tolerant EMS-induced mutant of Nagina 22, into two elite Basmati rice varieties, viz. Pusa Basmati 1121 and Pusa Basmati 1509. Genome wide association study (GWAS) was employed in rice to map significant QTLs for Fe and Zn for enhancing the endosperm mineral micronutrient density as rice is widely consumed after polishing. In pearl millet, QTLs for grain Fe and Zn content were mapped using 210 RILs (PPMI 683 × PPMI 627). Standardization of CRISPR-Cas9 Technology: The CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology was standardized for different crops to enhance stress tolerance and nutritional quality. In rice, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was employed to develop mutants of DST (DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE) gene for improving salt and drought tolerance. To reduce the seed phytate content, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to mutate GmIPK1 gene. T0 lines showed 6–9-fold reduction in phytate content. Overexpressing abscisic acid receptor OsPYL10 and Isopentenyltransferase 9 (IPT9) genes were found to confer drought and salt stress tolerance to transgenic rice.
