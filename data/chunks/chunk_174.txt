 All these operations requires more number of labour and hence increases the cost of cultivation and also often results in delay in transplanting because of shortage of labour. Increasing water scarcity is also becoming real threat for paddy cultivation. Direct seeding using drum seeder avoids raising of nursery, pulling of seedlings and transportation of the same to main field so that labour requirement for crop establishment is negligible. This method also requires less water as it avoids nursery and reduces crop duration. RASS KVK conducted demonstrations in NICRA cluster villages on direct seeding in rice using drum seeder during 2015 to 2018 during rabi season using the variety RNR-15048, which is a fine grain variety of 125 days duration and blast tolerant. On an average, direct seeded paddy using drum seeder recorded 11.5% higher grain yield (6,442 kg/ha), 18.4% low cost of cultivation (`47,586 per ha) and 64% higher net returns (`50,817 per ha) as compared to manual transplanting method. Majority of the farmers in the district are practicing this technology as it overcomes labour shortage, reduces cost of cultivation, water requirement in addition to yield enhancement. SUMMARY The implementation of climate resilient technologies played a key role in transforming climate vulnerable agriculture to climate smart agriculture in drought prone villages of erstwhile Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh. An integrated participatory approach through natural resource management, productivity enhancement in crops paid dividends in transforming this drought prone village into a climate resilient village. *Corresponding author email: nivassakamuri@gmail.com Demonstration of Arka Samrat tomato hybrid. sprinklers. KVK, Chittoor conducted demonstrations on yield improvement in groundnut by giving supplemental irrigation using sprinklers during kharif 2016 and 2017. During kharif 2016, the groundnut crop suffered due to two dry spells (1 to 29 August: 29 days and 30 August to 30 September: 32 days) during cropping season. During kharif 2017 also, the groundnut crop faced two dry spells (25 June to 10 July: 15 days and 17 July to 30 July: 15 days) at vegetative phase of the cropping period. KVK supplied sprinklers to farmers through Custom Hiring Center to provide supplemental irrigation to groundnut crop to overcome drought situation. About 38% increase in yield was observed in groundnut with supplementary irrigation using sprinklers (2,140 kg/ha). Drought tolerant ‘Dharani’ groundnut variety RASS KVK conducted 40 demonstrations on improved, drought and bud necrosis tolerant Dharani groundnut variety from kharif 2015 to 2018. Yield potential of Dharani variety is 16-26 q/ha (Kharif- rainfed), with 75-77% shelling outturn and 50% oil content. Hundred seed weight is 40-43 g and it is of 100-105 days duration. The variety is drought tolerant (withstands up to 35 days dry spell), uniform in maturity, high SMK (Sound Mature Kernel-90%) and has attractive pods.
