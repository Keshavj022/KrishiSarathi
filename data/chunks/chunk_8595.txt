 The National Research Centre on Equines, Hisar, made an effort to improve the socio- economic status of the poorest of the poor class of the society engaged in donkey and mule activities. Good quality donkey germplasm produced at the Centre was supplied to the village level equine breeding societies for increasing the production potential of the indigenous donkeys. The reports from the societies indicated enhancement of their income from Rs 3,000– 4,000 to Rs 10,000–12,000/year. Thus the centre is helping the underprivileged community of donkey owners in improving their socio-economic status through CHANGING THE LIFE OF DONKEY OWNERS BY ENHANCING GENETIC POTENTIAL OF THEIR EQUINES enhancement of potentiality of their donkey germplasm. PROPAGATION OF VANARAJA FOR RURAL POULTRY FARMING Vanaraja was under focus for its inherent trait of adaptability under varying climatic conditions and diverse topographical regions of the country. Day-old chicks and fertile eggs of Vanaraja were provided to user agencies in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Orissa, North- eastern states, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Feed resources under scavenging conditions were scanty in dry areas and rich in forest and hilly regions. Vanaraja birds adapted extremely well to regional variations and seasonal fluctuations. Under free-range conditions the adult female birds produced 120–140 eggs in a year. The males were utilized for the meat purposes, as they attained 1.5–3.0 kg live weight by 12 weeks of age depending upon the feed resources available to them. LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 109 TURKEY Production performance of female turkey housed in bamboo and thatched house: Daily egg production, feed consumption, FCR and mortality pattern revealed that numerically lower feed intake and better FCR was observed in the birds housed in hut as compared to those in conventional pakka house during first phase (20–42 weeks). During second phase (43–55 weeks) numerically higher egg production and average egg weight were observed in birds housed in hut, whereas better FCR was observed in conventional pakka house. CAMEL Qualitative and quantitative genetic parameters in Indian camel: The growth data over the years (1984–2002) was analyzed at the NRC on Camel, Bikaner, for studying the effect of breed and sex on growth. The weight at birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months were 34.76 ± 1.24 (201), 102.42 ± 4.61 (132), 161.74 ± 5.36 (119), 190.48 ± 6.32 (120), 219.44 ± 6.93 (151), 278.97 ± 6.14 (104), 354.49 ± 8.03 (79) and 448.19 ± 15.44 (78) kg, respectively. The effect of breed was significant at various stages of growth. The effect of sex was nonsignificant at almost all stages of growth. Except initial decline for 2–3 years body weight showed increasing trend in all camel breeds in 2, 3 and 4 years weight. This can be attributed to selection and improved management practices adopted at the centre.
