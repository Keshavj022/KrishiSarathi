On an average, women dedicate 233 min. per day to these activities. In contrast, 34.6% of men aged 6 and above participate in these activities, devoting an average of 330 min. per day to them. Consequently, the agricultural workforce consists of 38.7% women and 61.3% men. To assess the contributions of men and women in agriculture, participation rates were projected to the overall population, and the resulting figures were multiplied by the daily time spent. Notably, in Uttarakhand, women’s contributions were found to surpass those of men in both the crop and livestock sectors. On the other hand, Lakshadweep exhibited the lowest women’s participation in agriculture, with only 6.3%, followed by Bihar at 13.
