 The features of the proposed variety DBW 316 with respect to yield, disease resistance and quality parameters are detailed as under. Yield potential and adaptability to agronomic interventions: As compared to the checks DBW 316 has shown a superior yielding ability in late sown irrigated trials in terminal heat prone areas of Eastern Gangetic Plains over the 3 years of testing in the All India Coordinated multi-location wheat improvement trials. This variety has shown yield superiority over the checks HD 3118 (7.0%), HI 1621 (3.2%), HI 1563 (1.8%) and at par with DBW 107. The new variety has a high yield potential of 68.0 q/ha with an average yield of 41.0 q/ha under late sown conditions of NEPZ. In agronomic trials comparing performance under late sown (LS) and very late sown (VLS) conditions, DBW 316 showed least reduction (27.5) percentage in yield in VLS condition whereas yield reduction in other varieties was higher as PBW 833 (31.9%) PBW 835 (38.3%), HI 1563 (33.2%), HI 1621 (34.3%), HD 3118 (35.5%) and DBW 107 (37.3%). Its 1000-grain weight is highest (40.0 g) among all the test/ check entries in late sown varietal trial. This variety has desirable plant architecture with robust medium stature (average plant height 90 cm under late sown conditions) and average maturity duration of 114 days for NEPZ late sown conditions. DBW 316 is comparable to the check varieties HI 1563, HI 1621, HD 3118, DBW 107, for days to heading, maturity and plant height (Table 1). The package of practices for DBW 316 are given in Table 2. Better disease resistance: The variety was also evaluated for the resistance under natural and artificial epiphytotic conditions (PPSN) to the 3 rust diseases namely; yellow, brown, and stem rusts and other foliar diseases such as leaf blight and powdery mildew. The new variety DBW 316 has shown good level of resistance to all the 3 rusts of wheat. It also carries resistance against wheat blast disease, powdery mildew and foliar blights. In this variety an unknown Lr gene has been postulated conferring resistance against all the reported races of brown rust in India. Good quality: DBW 316 has amber-coloured hard grains with a very high protein content (average 13.2%). High protein content along with good level of Zn (average 38.2 ppm) and Fe (average 38.2 ppm) make this variety superior in nutritional quality as compared to all the checks. Besides, the proposed variety is suitable for multiple products as indicated by high bread loaf volume (593 ml), high bread- quality (score 7.7), chapatti quality Table 1.
