 Appendix Table B1 presents baseline household-level characteristics by treatment status for program-eligible villages and incidental villages. Across both sub-samples, households’ activity status, crop choice, farm input use and market activity prior to the start of the road-building program are similar in treatment and control villages, with a couple of exceptions. For the program- eligible sample, casual days worked in non-agriculture is lower and hybrid seed use is higher for treatment villages relative to control villages. For the incidental sample, casual days worked in non-agriculture is higher and irrigation and farm labor use are lower for treatment villages relative to control villages. To maximize power, I examine the pooled effect of treatment across the direct and incidental connections for several key outcomes. The estimating equation takes the form: 𝑦𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡= 𝛿𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡+ 𝜂𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 + 𝜇𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡+ 𝜌𝑖+ 𝛾𝑠𝑡+ 𝜖𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡 (5) 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡is an indicator that equals 1 if village 𝑣receives a program road before 2006. 5.3. Compositional effects Road infrastructure may induce the movement of workers out of agriculture. In estimating the impact of improved road connectivity on households’ production decisions in agriculture, simply conditioning on households within a village that remain in agriculture would bias estimates as there may be selection in the types of households that move out of agriculture. For example, if the least productive agricul- tural households in the village switch to the non-agricultural sector, this would lead to an over-estimate of the reduced-form impacts on agricultural production. Within village boundaries, non-agricultural opportunities are lim- ited. Workers who seek non-agricultural employment often commute to nearby factories or towns19 for jobs in low-skilled manufacturing or construction. I construct a proxy for households’ access to employment opportunities outside of agriculture using distance to the closest town at 19 A census town is defined as: (i) population exceeding 5000 and (ii) at least 75 percent of the male working population employed outside the agricultural sector. Fig. 2. Distance between REDS village and closest Census town in 1999. This figure plots the distance between a REDS village and its closest town, as recorded in the REDS 1999 village survey. The solid lines denote the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of this distribution, which are 4, 10, and 19.5 kilometers respectively. The dotted line denotes the mean (13.3 kilometers). baseline. Fig. 2 plots the distribution of the distance between each REDS village and the nearest town in 1999 — the median is 10 kilometers. I define a proxy for access to employment in non-agriculture to be a binary indicator that takes the value 1 when a village is within the median distance of the closest town.
