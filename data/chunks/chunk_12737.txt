 Boundary plantation with perennial tree species for forage, green leaf manure, mulching and ecosystem services for moderating microclimate at individual farm level Dryland horticulture with predominant fruit crops along with micro-irrigation, micro- site improvement. Rejuvenation of existing orchads for higher productivity and introducing short duration pulses, horse-gram, Style fodder spp. Diversifying to non-farm linked to agriculture Individual/ Group based income generating activities Seed production & Processing units; Agri clinics & Custom hiring services; Seedling nursery supply units; Vermicomposting; Bee keeping; Mushroom production; Artisans; Farm equipment repair & maintenance; Food processing etc. Approach II. Reducing Production Costs Strategy/ Priority Activity Resource Domain Strategies &Convergence Reducing purchased inputs Organic farming Irrigate/ Rainfed Delineation of organic farming crop zones. Identification of multiple crop sequences including legume components. Identification of combination of organic manures Preparation of production protocols for organic Crops Standardization of certification protocols for organic crop production Green manuring of crops Wider adoption of bio-fertilizers & bio-pesticides 544 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Strategy/ Priority Activity Resource Domain Strategies &Convergence Soil test based Nutrient management Irrigate/ Rainfed Soil resource information system at individual farm level Crop residue recycling, INM & SSNM Revisiting of recommended doses of fertilizers Popularization of use of neem coated urea Soil health -crop advisories Fertigation Irrigate/ Rainfed Popularization of fertigation equipment Identification of suitable water soluble fertilizers Standardization and popularization of fertigation scheduling programmes for both commercial field & horticultural crops Farm mechaniza- tion Irrigate Development, testing and popularization of farm machinery/implements for timely agricultural operations Large scale mechanization in small & marginal farms Promotion of Custom hiring centres (CHC) as a cluster based approach. Establishing a Model Custom hiring, training and maintenance centre Developing entrepreneurship of unemployed rural youth Harnessing comple- ment-arities to reduce input costs Resource & Input use efficiency Irri- gated/ Rainfed Promotion of crop + livestock enterprises to increase soil carbon status using organic manure and reduce fertilizer costs Promotion of INM & IPM to reduce fertilizer & plant protection costs Promotion of Legumes in crop rotation & intercropping systems to fix atmospheric nitrogen and reduce fertilizer & plant protection costs Mapping soil health for precise fertilizer application to increase fertilizer use efficiency and reduce fertilizer costs Approach III.
