Impact of geographical indications on agricultural exports 361 market expansion effect, which are opposite to each other when it comes to increasing production. As GI-tagged agri- cultural products command a premium price and higher global demand, we hypothesise that farmers must have higher motivation to plant these crops. Through our analysis, we propose the net effect of market power and market expansion effects of a GI tag on the production of agricul- tural products. Here, we take cropping pattern as a proxy for the relative production of different crops. We use data on cropping patterns from the agriculture census to study the impact of GI tags on cropping patterns at the district level. We estimate the speciﬁca- tion below: sharecdt ¼ b1GIcdt þ a0 þ acd þ adt þ act þ ncdt ð4Þ We control for crop-district, district-year, and crop-year ﬁxed effects. Here, sharecdt represents the share of cropping pattern at crop-district-year level. On the right-hand side, G Icdt is 1 if a GI tag is available for a particular crop c in dis- trict d at time t. Table 11 reports the results from estimating Equation (4). Column 1 includes all district-crop observations, while Table 7 Concordance table for matching HS2 codes with products.
