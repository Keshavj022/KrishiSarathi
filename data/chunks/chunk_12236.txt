Package of Practice (Annexure VI) 150  Summary of the Proposal • The proposed variety HD 3086 has given higher yield; ranging from 0.52 to 4.19 % in three years of testing against the checks and the qualifying variety DBW 88. The variety has shown a genetic potential of 71.1 q/ha • The proposed variety HD 3086 has shown a very high level of resistance against stripe rust and leaf rust with slow-rusting type of APR reactions compared to checks and qualifying varieties, which showed susceptible reaction in fields and in artificial conditions. • The proposed variety HD 3086 is an Indian bred non-1B/1R material, will add to diversity in the varietal pattern of the NWPZ as the two of the other varieties, PBW 621-50 and HD 3059, already notified for cultivation as well, and the qualifying variety DBW 88 has the common parentage, originating from the CIMMYT nurseries. • In 55 trials, the proposed variety HD 3086 appeared 24 times in first non-significant group as compared to the check varieties DBW 17 (14/55), DPW 621-50 (20/45), HD 2967(10/21) and WH 1105 (10/21). It has shown consistent performance over the years and the locations. The variety has shown highest number of ear-heads/m2 and 1,000- kernel weight in agronomic trials. • The proposed variety HD 3086 showed very high degree of resistance against loose smut and flag smut as compared to all check and qualifying varieties • It has the best HMW sub-units combination for bread-making with Glu-1 score, 10/10. The proposed variety has the best grain appearance score, hecto-litre weight, higher value of bread loaf volume (cc) and bread-quality score. The variety, therefore, may find favour with bread-making industries. • The proposed variety has highest extraction rate (70.5), chapati score (7.65) and wet gluten percentage (31.3), and, therefore, may also find favour with milling and baking industries. 130 GUIDELINES FOR TESTING CROP VARIETIES UNDER AICCIPS Proposal for Identification of Wheat Variety HD 3086 (Pusa Gautami) by Workshop 1 Name of the crop and species : Wheat, Triticum aestivum L.
