Standardization Activities in ISO Standardization roadmap on smart farming was developed by the _ International Standardization Organisation (ISO) Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) on Smart Farming. Nine thematic areas were examined in relation to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): crop production, livestock, urban farming, terminology and semantics, social aspects, supply TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 54 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 55 chains, original equipment manufacturers, climate adaptation, environment and data. ISO standards for agriculture cover all aspects of farming, from irrigation and global positioning systems (GPS) to agricultural machinery, animal welfare and sustainable farm management8. Some of the important standards released by ISO related to agriculture sector are mentioned below- Table 8: ISO Standards related to Agriculture Sl. No. Standards Title 1 ISO 15003 Agricultural engineering – Electrical and electronic equipment – Testing resistance to environmental conditions 2 ISO 24631 Radio frequency identification of animals 3 ISO 11783 Tractors and machinery for agriculture and forestry 4 ISO 22005 Traceability in the feed and food chain – General principles and basic requirements for system design and implementation 5 ISO 20966 Automatic milking installations – Requirements and testing 6 ISO 4002 Equipment for sowing and planting 7 ISO 11783 Serial control and communications data network for agricultural tractors 5.3. oneM2M Standards oneM2M is the global standards initiative that covers requirements, architecture, API specifications, security solutions and interoperability for Machine-to-Machine and loT technologies. oneM2M was formed in 2012 and consists of eight of the world's preeminent Standards Development Organizations (SDOs): ETSI (Europe), TSDSI (India), TTC (Japan), ARIB (Japan), ATIS (USA), TIA (USA), TTA (Korea), CCSA (China).
