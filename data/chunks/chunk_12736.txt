 Productive and risk resilient intercropping systems in major rainfed crops for minimizing risk and enhanced productivity. 542 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Strategy Activity Resource Domain Action Points Real-time contingency crop plan implementation to cope with delayed onset of monsoon and seasonal drought (early/midseason/terminal drought), high intensity rain all events. Soil test based nutrient management - with a focus on INM, balanced nutrition, crop residue recycling, green leaf manuring etc. Increasing Seed replacement Rate Irrigate/ Rainfed Production of breeder, foundation & certified seed. Timely supply of high yielding varieties & hybrid seeds Seed village programme Increasing irrigated area Irrigated Water resource development for Permanent irrigation. Desilting tanks to increase volume of water for irrigation of crops & groundwater stabilization. Augmenting & popularization of use of treated wastewaters for irrigation. Adoption of water saving technologies viz., Drip & sprinkler irrigation in commercial field & horticultural crops. Implementation & popularization of Water conserving technologies viz., drum seeding, aerobic & alternate wetting & drying irrigation practice in rice Rainfed Popularization of in-situ and ex-situ rain water management practices for increasing area under supplemental irrigation Enhancing output price Marketing intelligence & creation of market infrastructure to realize higher prices Irrigated/ Rainfed Linking farmers to Electronic National Agricultural Market to avoid distress sales by farmers Aggregation of produce for collective bargaining; Staggered sales to avoid distress sales by farmers. Procurement of Paddy/other crops through IKP centres Improving holding capacity of produce by farmers in warehouses to avoid distress sales Processing and value addition of pulses, millets, spices, vegetables & fruits Crop planning based on market intelligence Crop colonies to regulate cropped area & production to realize higher commodity prices Seed production through contract farming 543 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Strategy Activity Resource Domain Action Points Diversifying with in farm Sustainable intensification Irrigated/ Rainfed Diversification to high value crops Implementation & popularization of integrated rice + fish culture system Implementation & popularization of integrated maize + dairy + poultry system Strengthening existing traditional rainfed farming systems Implementation & popularization of risk resilient integrated farming systems Identification of appropriate land capability / suitability based agroforestry systems Promotion of pasture, silvi-pasture systems, fodder trees, multiple tree based systems in non-arable on large scale, particularly in village common lands.
