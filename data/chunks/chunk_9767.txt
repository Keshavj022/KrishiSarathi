Choosing appropriate variety depending on location and time of sowing is very important apart from good crop management. Availability of seeds of high yielding varieties is a limitation. By the efforts of ICAR-Indian Institute of Millets Research, 18 Seed hubs have been established at different parts of country with the funding from Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DAF&W). The objective of these Seed hubs along with enhanced Breeder seed production programme by the DAF&W is to supply the latest high yielding variety seeds at reasonable price for enhancing the production of small millets from rainfed agriculture in India. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: hari@millets.res.in Physical chemistry of soil and soil mineralogy are the two pillars which form the basic foundation of soil science.
