 India, on the one hand, has rapidly grown in urban population from 31% Extent of urban agriculture and food security 437 The authors are profoundly grateful to the urban agriculture households who spent the time to answer our questionnaires. The authors also express our deepest gratitude to Ms Wilhemina Kwabeng Owusu for her proofreading of the draft manuscript.

Specifically, the second-highest growth rate of the population is expected to be in Bihar (55.4%) in India (Singh and Singh, 2020). In parallel, Ghana has witnessed a rapid growth in the urban population of almost all its regions (Ghana Statistical Service, 2013a). The swift changes in the urban and rural population of most countries in Africa and Asia have led to a growth in urban food insecurity as well as increasing levels of poverty and other social challenges (Crush and Frayne, 2011). At the same time, an agribusiness opportunity has arisen due to the high demand for agricultural produce. Food security is, “When all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”, by the World Food Summit of 1996’. This definition encapsulates four main dimensions [1]: “physical availability of food”, “economic and physical access to food”, “food utilisation” and “the stability of the other three dimensions over time”. From this, it can be inferred that food security is a multivariate idea influenced by an array of factors. While urbanisation is one of the factors that destabilises food security dimensions, Urban Agriculture [2] (UA) is perceived to be a crucial strategy to curtail food insecurity in urban areas and cities by several international organisations, researchers and practitioners. Few critics, however, maintain that, UA does not really have an impact on the poor since they do not have the economic resources to undertake the same (Haysom and Battersby, 2016). Some studies present a gloomy picture of the unhealthy usage of wastewater in urban farming (Graefe et al., 2008; Dalla Marta et al., 2019) and the extensive unhealthy use of pesticides with gendered long-term effect on health (Nyantakyi-Frimpong, 2016). Nevertheless, many scholars argue that the significance of UA to food security in urban spaces cannot be overemphasised (Poulsen et al., 2015).
