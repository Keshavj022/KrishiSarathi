 Sapota unripe C. Sapota (unripe) smashed and mix D. Jackfruit tree E, F. Jack leaf powder sapota group and jack group. Serum biochemistry dung culture were undertaken only in jackfruit- leaf group. Values of serum biochemistry are available for 13 cases before and after treatment. A preliminary study with culture o f dung samples was undertaken for three animals each of normal and diarrhoeic animals. As the growth pattern was uniform in both the cases, the 296 VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY parameter was dropped from the study. The study also included a control group of six healthy animals for comparison of quantitative data. The study was conducted in 50 cases of diarrhoea in ruminant animals comprising of two treatments groups viz. sapota ( unripe ) and jackfruit leaves with 25 animals each. Sapota Fig. 5.

Jackfruit leaves group comprised 15 cows, 6 bullocks and 4 cow calves. The clinical efficacy of sapota (unripe fruit) and jackfruit leaves in the treatment of diarrhoea was determined. Observations on clinical signs like feed intake and dung characteristics were recorded in all the 25 animals of each group. The temperature was within the normal range in all animals of this study. Leucogram was studied in 14 cattle (including cow, bullock, buffalo, and calves) of each group (Table 1). Serum electrolytes were studied in 13 animals of jack leaves group only (Table 2). In these 13 animals of jack group, leucogram and serum electrolyte changes between before and after treatment were also studied. All the quantitative data were subjected to appropriate statistical analysis viz.CRD or paired ‘t’ test. respectively ( Fig. 7 ) . No side - effects were observed in either trials. Duration of therapeutic response: In sapota group (Fig. 7), 57% animals were cured in 2 days and 29% animals in 1 day only. The other 14% animals required 3 days treatment (Fig. 7). In the jack group, 50% cases each required 1 day and 2 days treatment only. Clinical signs Feed intake: In animals treated with sapota (Fig. 3), inappetance, anorexia and normal feeding habits were recorded in 48%, 36% and 16% cases respectively. In the jackfruit group, 76% of the animals had normal feeding habits.
