 In the study area, excellent to good zone has 19 % (n = 18) of groundwater samples, good to permissible zone has 50 % (n = 47) of groundwater samples, permissible to doubtful zone has 8 % (n = 7) of groundwater samples, and doubtful to unsuitable zone has 23 % (n = 22) of groundwater samples. Consequently, the permissible to unsuitable water types indicates that there may be risks to plant development. Fig. 4. Suitability of groundwater for irrigation quality (after USSL 1954). M.R.

Residual sodium carbonate (RSC) RSC is a method for assessing the hazard of soil alkalinity resulting from low-quality irrigation water. HCO3 – and CO3 – are significant factors for identify the quality of the groundwater suitable for irrigation and agricultural practices. RSC is a combination of HCO3 –, Ca2+and Mg2+ions. High concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions dissolved in water and its impacts on irrigation water quality is determined by the index (Singh et al., 2019). The total concentrations of HCO3 – are lower than that of Ca2+ and Mg2+ indicating that the water is likely to precipitate more Ca2+ and Mg2+. It limits crop productivity when used for irrigation (Saraswat, et al., 2023). RSC values are from −16.9 to 4.02 meq/L with average of -3.44 (Table 4). Based on RSC classification, 89 % (n = 84) of groundwater samples showing RSC below 1.25 meq/L are of good type, 5 % (n = 4) of groundwater samples come under doubtful (1.25––2.25 meq/L) type, and 6 % (n = 6) of groundwater samples are present in the unsuitable type (> 2.25 meg/L) in the area of interest (Table 5). In the good category majority of samples are present and few found negative RSC. This indicates partial precipitation of divalent Ca2+ and Mg2+ and in water. These ions fail to precipitate completely in the water due to the counter ions having negligible and no hazard to the Na+ value in the water sample (Unigwe et al., 2022). 3.2.4. Permeability index (PI) PI assesses irrigation water quality based on the ratio of cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+) and anions (Cl−and HCO3 −) dissolved in water. On the basis of permeability index, Doneen (1964) established three categories of water quality. (1) Class I (100 %), (2) Class II (75 to 100 %), and (3) Class III (25 %), which are measured as good, moderate, and unsuitable water quality categories for irrigation, respectively (Fig. 6). PI values vary from 13.05 to 99.5 with average of 62.56 (Table 4). About 41 % (n = 39), 45 % (n = 42), and 14 % (n = 13) of groundwater samples come under good, moderate, and unsuitable types for irrigation, respectively (Table 5). Based on Doneen’s classification, 64 % (n = 60) of groundwater samples have Class II (75 to 100 %), 33 % (n = 31) of groundwater samples have Class I (100 %), and the remaining 3 % (n = 3) have Class III (25 %). High permeability favours irrigation purposes and crop yield. 3.2.5.
