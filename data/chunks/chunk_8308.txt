, 1992 with minor modifications from safflower, saffron and their mixtures where the concentration of Safflower in Saffron was kept 1%, 3%, 5%, 7% and 10%. PCR based SCAR markers: ScCt131 (Torelli et al., 2014), SAF L-40, SAF L-4 (Javanmardi et al., 2011) and DNA barcodes: ITS2, psbA-trnH (Chen et al., 2010) primers were synthesized and used for detection of Safflower adulteration. Gradient PCR with varying Magnesium concentration was performed for the optimization of annealing temperature for all set of primers. In case of SCAR markers SAF L-40, SAF L-4 and ScCt131, an annealing temperature of 55ºC and 2mM MgCl2 was found to be optimum. Amplification products of 414 bp for SAF L-40, 412 bp for SAF L-4 and 131 bp for ScCt131 were observed. Safflower concentration as low as 1% could be detected by using primer SAFL-40 and ScCt131 which gave the amplification product of expected size 414 bp and 131 bp, respectively. PCR amplification of safflower and saffron with DNA barcodes ITS2 and psbA-trnH were also optimized. An annealing temperature of 50°C and 2mM MgCl2 was found to be optimum in all the cases that yielded the product of approximately 500 bp with ITS2 and 500bp with psbA-trnH in safflower. In case of saffron, a product of approximately 500 bp with ITS2 and 650 bp with psbA-trnH was obtained. Therefore, the psbA- trnH barcode could be used for detection of safflower adulteration in saffron. Safflower concentration (500bp amplicon) of as low as 1% was detected by using primer set psbA-trnH and it could also detect saffron (650bp amplicon). Amplification of safflower and saffron with psbA- trnH. Lane no. M: 100bp DNA ladder; Lane 1-7: pure safflower , 1% safflower in saffron, 3% safflower in saffron, 5% safflower in saffron, 7% safflower in saffron, 10% safflower in saffron and pure saffron Pear Canning in non-nutritive sweetener A process for canning of pear slices was developed at ICAR-CIPHET by using stevia extract as non- nutritive sweetener in order to produce a low calorie food. Sugar syrup of 40 oBx and stevia extract to the taste of 40 oBx were prepared and mixed in five different proportions of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100 for using as a canning syrup. The composition of non- Integrated Small Scale Lac Processing Unit (a) Seedlac manufactured in integrated small scale lac processing unit; (b) Seedlac manufactured in small scale lac processing unit (a) (b) Advantages of integrated lac processing unit: Lighter colour seedlac with impurity content of around 2% (approx.), reduced requirement of water (5-6 times of the raw material) and manpower are some of the key advantages of the unit. Lighter colour lac dye with dye content above 50% could be produced from wash water of first batch washing through Integrated Small Scale Lac Processing Unit compared to 30– 35% dye content from wash water of conventional and continuous washing process.
