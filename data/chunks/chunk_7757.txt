Salient achievements • Whole set of marker defined chromosome segment substitution lines of rice were developed for the first time in India. These were developed from inter-specific crosses between two elite cultivars (MTU1010, Swarna) and two progenitor wild species (Oryza nivara, O. rufipogon). • Swarna × O. nivara derivative RPBio4918-228S with high resistance to brown plant hopper and multiple pest resistance in AICRIP was registered with NBPGR as INGR18002. • CMS based canola mustard hybrid RCH1 was approved by the research evaluation committee of Punjab Agricultural University for adaptive evaluation in farmers’ field in Punjab. When commercially released, this will be first canola mustard hybrid in the country.
