 l Indigenous bulls are being selected by progeny testing at organized farms. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 100 years). Overall conception rate in heifers was 41.7% and in cows 55.4%. In test matings 33 bulls have so far been used in 4 sets (8+8+8+9). The balance of semen doses available on closing date at Germplasm Unit was 12,810, 12,355, 29,010 and 18,595 (total 72,770) from first, second, third and fourth set of bulls, respectively.Average age at first calving, first lactation milk yield and peak yield were 51.15 months, 588 kg and 3.77 kg, respectively. First dry period, service period and calving interval averaged 331, 240 and 544 days, respectively. Based on the daughters’ first lactation yield, two sets, which comprised 8 bulls in each set, were evaluated and ranked. Top two bulls from first set were L–15 (sire index = 583) and L–10 (sire index = 579), and from second set L–12 (sire index = 517) and L–35 (sire index = 503).Draught power studies revealed that power varied from 0.64 to 1.13 HP among the bulls. Gir: At the GAU, Junagadh, the germplasm herd reported 87 calvings out of which 11 were from the heifers. Age at first calving of these heifers was 53.0 months.Mean lactation yield, lactation length, dry period, service period and calving interval were 2,100 litres, 338 days, 133 days, 184 days and 457 days, respectively. Field Progeny Testing Under the Frieswal Project and other Holstein–Friesian crossbred bulls are being progeny tested under field conditions at the PAU Ludhiana, KAU Mannuthy, and BAIF, Uruli-kanchan.At the PAU, Ludhiana, inseminations were done from bulls of third set (746 inseminations) and fourth set (4,084 inseminations) of the Network programme. The production performance of the first set of bulls showed that the daughters of bull No. WAM 303 recorded highest average milk production of 3,208.1 ± 405.7 kg (first lactation 305 days), and daughters of bull No. DON recorded the minimum (2,030.7 ± 300.3 kg) indicating considerable variation in their breeding values–the age at first calving was 34.7 ± 0.03 months, and the fat percentage at second, fifth and eighth month of lactation was 3.4 ± 0.03, 3.8 ± 0.03 and 4.2 ± 0.03, respectively. At the BAIF, Uruli-kanchan the average milk production of 8,076 daughters of 19 bulls was 2,969.8 ± 9.99 kg, ranging from 1,892.32 kg for the daughters of Tony bull to 3,753.35 kg for the daughters of Nabha bull. Out of 17,239 inseminations followed for pregnancies, 7,673 pregnancies were confirmed and the conception rate was 44.51%. At the KAU, Mannuthy, the overall average first lactation milk yield of the daughters of tested bulls was 2,056.7 litres as compared to their dams yield of 1,764.1 litres in different parities. The average age at first calving of the daughters was 34.5 months. The overall averages of fat percentage were 3.51 and 4.27 in the morning and evening milk samples, respectively, at second month, 3.87 and 4.47 at the fifth month, and 4.06 and 4.
