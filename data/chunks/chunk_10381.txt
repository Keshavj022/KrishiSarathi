 Nasal and ocular discharges were common in diseased animals. The death and infection rates in newly exposed populations were very high and sometimes up to 95-100 % leading to huge economic losses. Before the 1950s, a large number of bovine deaths were reported every year due to rinderpest in the country. The incidence of disease decreased to some extent (100-150 thousand) after 1935, when Goat Tissue Vaccine (GTV) developed at IVRI Mukteswar in the year 1927 (Edwards, 1927) was applied in livestock population. Subsequently during the 1st plan period (1954), a mass vaccination campaign against the cattle plague in the name of National Rinderpest Eradication Programme (NREP) using GTV vaccine was launched. The cattle and buffalo above 6 months of age were vaccinated using GTV vaccine. Subsequently, a safer vaccine developed by Plowright and Ferris (1962) namely Tissue Culture Rinderpest (TCRP) vaccine was introduced in India during 1970s (Yadav et al. 2016). The TCRP vaccine was safe for pregnant and lactating animals, and conferred life-long immunity. Calf hood vaccination was done at 6-12 months of age and it was also efficacious in cross breed cattle, sheep, goats and pigs. Therefore, this vaccine was widely adopted. Between 1956-1989, a total of 1300 million doses of vaccination against rinderpest were carried out. These interventions led to reduction in disease outbreaks in India; however, extensive surveillance was required to prove absence of disease as per OIE pathway of rinderpest eradication. The overall sero-conversion rates/herd immunity of more than 70% were achieved at the completion of the national vaccination campaign in 2000. This effort totally stopped the transmission cycle of rinderpest virus. The mAb-based rinderpest competitive ELISA kit developed by ICAR-IVRI, validated by FAO and recommended by OIE, was used during the final stage of rinderpest eradication. The sero-surveillance using indigenously developed competitive ELISA kit (Singh et al. 2000) was continued till the year 2004 in order to prove that no virus is circulating in the population. The effect of vaccination on rinderpest related disease incidence & mortality is shown in Table 1. Table 1.
