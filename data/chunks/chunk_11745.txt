Feed and water troughs should be designed and located such that the animals cannot get into them and the troughs remain clean. Where feed and water troughs are provided in the loafing area, the access areas should be sufficiently wide to permit free movement of animals and prevent routes becoming wet and slippery. The feeding and watering space requirements according to BIS are given in Table 3 and the dimensions are presented in Table 4.

Research in the field has indicated that elevated mangers are not desirable with regard to the feeding behaviour of the cow or feed utilization. The fence-line feeding system which allows access to feed from ground level while preventing the animals from walking and defecating on the feed by using fencing is better for natural ingestive behaviour, economical to construct and saves labour. Standard dimensions for fence-line feed barriers for cattle are presented in Table 5.

The bigger sized Gaushalas must have a veterinary clinic / dispensary attached to them.
