Several abiotic (drought, frost, hailstorms, floods, and insufficient chilling) and biotic (insect pests, diseases, nematodes, monkeys, stray/wild animals, and birds) are the major constraints to increase farm productivity. Because of the monkey menace and crop damage by the wild/ stray animals, many farmers have given up crop cultivation in many parts of Himachal Pradesh.
