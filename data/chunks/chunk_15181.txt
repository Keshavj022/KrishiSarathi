, 1989), which takes account of the changes in atmospheric δ13C through time and therefore enables comparison of isotopic data from different time periods (Ferrio et al., 2005). The stable nitrogen isotope values of crop remains, and specifically grains/seeds, primarily reflect the δ15N value of the soil in which the plant grew. This is influenced by the land use history (Peukert et al., 2012) and can reflect agricultural practices such as manuring (e.g., Fraser et al., 2011; Bogaard et al., 2013; Styring et al., 2016a, 2016b; Nitsch et al., 2017; Styring et al., 2017), while factoring in the effects of environmental constraints such as aridity (e.g., Styring et al., 2016a, 2016b; Styring et al., 2017). Previous studies have shown that intensive A. Nayak et al. Journal of Archaeological Science 141 (2022) 105591 4 manuring can elevate the crop δ15N values by as much as 10‰ and so the δ15N value can provide insights into the intensity of manuring in agri­ cultural practices (e.g., Fraser et al., 2011; Bogaard et al., 2013; Styring et al., 2016a, 2016b; Santana-Sagredo, 2021). Additionally, soil water regimes affect δ15N of plants, with waterlogged soils having elevated values as a result of denitrification (Kendall, 1998). However, as Lim and colleagues (Lim et al., 2015) have shown with rice agriculture, restricted nitrification in a paddy field may result in lower δ15N values compared to rice grown in upland soils. Moreover, nitrogen cycling is a complex environmental process, which can affect crop δ15N values in a number of additional ways (e.g., Nadelhoffer and Fry 1994; Handley et al., 1999; H¨ogberg 1997; Hobbie and Ouimette 2009; Hobbie and H¨ogberg 2012, Szpak 2014; Tashi et al., 2016). Consequently, similar to stable carbon isotope data, the interpretation of stable nitrogen isotope data from archaeobotanical plant remains is limited in providing a complete view of ancient agro-ecological conditions owing to the high number of un­ knowns about the past. 4. Sites, samples, methods 4.1. Sites and samples 4.1.1. East India: Gopalpur, Golbai Sasan and Harirajpur-Bang The three East Indian sites that form part of this study, Gopalpur, Golbai Sasan and Harirajpur, are all mound settlements with their in­ habitants practicing agriculture of domesticated crop (rice and pulses, with small amounts of millets) and animal species (Basa and Mohanty, 2000; Fuller and Harvey, 2006; Harvey et al., 2006; Mohanty et al., 2012). The sites are located in close proximity to each other (Fig. 1), with a distance of 24 km separating Golbai Sassan and Harirajpur, and Gopalpur located 21 km to the west of the former. Additionally, all three sites are roughly contemporaneous, with Gopalpur spanning c.1395-915 BCE, Golbai Sassan spanning c. 1500-900 BCE, and Harirajpur-Bang spanning 1370–1115 BC (Harvey et al., 2006; Kingwell-Banham et al., 2018).
