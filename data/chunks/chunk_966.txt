Linseed, although a lesser- known oilseed crop requires less management inputs with comparatively more economic benefits as well as nutritional values. With the prevailing climatic situations and the available natural resources of the region, this crop could be one of the most viable alternative options to fit into different cropping systems especially in rice fallows during winter (rabi) season. Sensitization on the health benefits of flaxseed, its processing techniques, value addition, marketing, scope for entrepreneurship with the aim to enhance income are some of the areas to be reiterated upon.

Linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) crop is being grown either for oil or fiber (linen) purposes depending on the varieties selected. Since linseed oil is prone to oxidation, hence it is mostly used as an ideal drying oil with many industrial uses. Linseed crop also provides high protein feed stock after oil extraction along with the straw as animal feed, fibers and shives as by-products. It contains about 40â€“50% oil, which is mostly made up of beneficial polyunsaturated fatty acids. For centuries, flaxseed has been used as a natural medicine and is a potential future functional ingredient with a wide variety of clinical benefits. It is reported to be one of the richest sources of lignin (800 times more than any other plant seed) which provides protection against certain forms of cancer owing to estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activity in the body. Flaxseed is considered as functional food owing to the presence of three main bioactive components-alpha-linolenic acid, lignans and dietary fiber. Many studies have reported that flaxseed has hypoglycemic and hypolipemic properties, causing foods to have a lower glycemic index.
