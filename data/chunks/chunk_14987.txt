Sahoo et al. World Development Sustainability 4 (2024) 100127 8 agricultural decisions is 28.992. This implies with one unit increase in the experience in overall agrarian activities, the relative risk of being in the female group would be 28.992 times more likely, i.e., if someone in the household wishes to make her experience count in the overall agricultural decision-making, she would be expected to be the owner of the land in the family, a case of women empowerment. Similar is the result for the procurement of seeds (RRR is 72.286), the decision on agricultural expenditure (RRR is 251.53), the timing of agricultural decision (RRR is 320.167), and the marketing decision on agricultural produce (RRR is 33.873). Further, the RRR of the land ownership by both male and female members of the households for procurement and collection of seeds are 3.445 and 10.634, respectively. Such finding justifies the theoretical argument made earlier and is supported by literature ([2,9,30,33,48] add citation). Joint ownership of land by both men and women also raises the agrarian decision-making power of the females. Experience in overall agrarian activities is inversely related to the overall agricultural decision to be taken by the female. The RRR of experience in overall agrarian activities for overall agricultural decision is 0.25, which is one unit increase in the experience in overall agrarian activities for females relative to males. This implies, with one unit in­ crease in the experience in overall agrarian activities, the relative risk of being in the female group would be 0.25 times more likely, i.e., if someone in the household wishes to make her/his experience count in the overall agricultural decision making, she/he would be expected to be a Male, a clear case of gender biasness. Further, the information on overall farming is also negatively related to the overall agricultural decision to be taken by the women (the coefficient is -4.453, and the RRR is 0.012). The result implies that even if someone has sufficient information on farming activities, she needs to be a Male for her voice to be heard. Similarly, the decision on agricultural expenditure and timing of agricultural activities are negatively associated with the experience and information of women in overall agrarian activities (the RRR in both cases is less than one, indicating male dominance in these households).
