Lucern: Variety: Guj. Anand Lucern – 3, 4 ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 321 Zone-IX mAdHyA PRAdesH Wheat Prepare fallow field to conserve the moisture in case of un-irrigated area. Select the variety viz: C-306, JW3020, JW3280, JW3137, HI1531 Select the wheat varieties viz. JW3288, JW3020, JW3211, HI1531, HI74672 in case of facility of one or two irrigation For irrigated timely sown condition (15-30 Nov.) use high yielding varieties viz- JW3382, JW3465, JW1201, GW322, GW273, GW366 Under irrigated late sowing condition (1-30 Dec.) preference should be to early and terminal react to tolerant variety viz- JW3336, NI1633, HD2864, HD2932 and lok-1. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 322 Seed treatment with fungicide (vitavax or thiram) 2.5 g/k to protect from seed from soil borne pathogens. Seed rate for sowing should be 100 kg/ha in case of 1000 seed weight (38-40 g). Every increase of per from add 2kg seed. Use Recommended dose of fertilizer to harvest potential yield FR – 40:20:10 NPK kg/ha Limited/partial irrigation – 60:40:30 NPK kg/ha Irrigation – 120:60:40 NPK kg/ha Use of micronutrient as per soil test value for harvesting the good yield Zine - 25 kg/ha sulphur - 10 kg/ha Borex - 2 kg/ha Management of irrigation as per availability One irrigation - 35-40 days Two irrigation - 30-35 days 60-65 days Five to six irrigation - 20-25 days 40-50 days 65-70 days 85-90 days 100-105 days Control of weeds should be necessary to use appropriate herbicides Broad leaf - 2-4D @ 0.5 kg a.i./ha Metsulphuron - 10g/ha Narrow leaf Sulphosulphuron - 25g ai/ha Clodinophop - 100 g ai/ha ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 323 At proper maturity harvest the crop and give the solar treatment before storage it to avoid the losses from insect pests. For improving soil health use of 3 tons FYM Use of PSB and Azotobactor 500g/100kg of seed at the time seed treatment always facilitate the production. Chickpea Use of high yielding and pest tolerant varieties JG 315, JG 74, JG 322, JG 14, JG 11, JG 130, JG 16, JAKI 92-18, JG 63, JG 412, JG 226, JG 36, PBG 1, BG 267, GNG146, RVG 201, RVG 202. Use high yielding varieties of Kabuli Chickpea JGK 1, JGK 2, JGK 3, KAK 2 and pink chickpea variety JGG 1 for sowing. Sowing must be done in the first fortnight of November by using Ridge and Furrow method or Raised Bed Method for saving of seed and water. Intercropping of chickpea + coriander /mustard in the ratio of 8:2 must be done.
