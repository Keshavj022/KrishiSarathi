 coli in control group while negligible numbers in treatment groups and higher germination percentage in treatment groups as compared to control. C:N ratio in treatment groups was maintained at 30:1 and water content at 50–55%. Ferrification (0.1 M) and acidification (0.1 M) of poultry biogas resulted in reduction of H2S and NH3 level below 4.0 ppm and CO2 below 16% in dilution-acidification-carbonization (DAC) technology developed at CARI, Izatnagar. Simultaneously, CH4 level rose to almost 79%. ❑ 4. Genetic Resources Germplasm augmentation, conservation and use: A total of 23 explorations were undertaken and 2,623 accessions were collected (2,026 cultivated and 597 wild) from parts of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar, Bihar, Karnataka, Odisha, Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Nagaland, Tripura, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. Important germplasm lines collected included cold tolerant barley and wheat (46), Allium spp. (21) from Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir; landraces of paddy (93), taro (10), chilli (9), cowpea (12) and urd (8) from Assam; rice landraces (32) from Manipur; rice landraces (28) and legumes (mainly urd-1; pigeonpea-10) from Meghalaya; rice landraces (15) from Upper Siang, Arunachal Pradesh; vegetables (189) from Tripura; maize (11) from Mizoram; different cucurbits (65) from Bihar; coriander (54) from Madhya Pradesh; and tropical underutilized minor fruits (39) from Goa and Konkan region of Maharashtra. Among the collected wild relatives of different crops, mainly of wheat and barley (Elymus spp.-34; Leymus secalinus- 11) were collected from the cold desert of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir; and wild okra (43) from Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. A total of 376 herbarium specimens were processed (in addition to 886 virtual herbarium specimens) and added to the National Herbarium of Cultivated Plants (NHCP), New Delhi bringing the holdings to a total of 23,942 specimens. Germplasm conservation: A total of 12,417 accessions of orthodox seed species were added to the National Genebank for long-term storage and currently the base collection of National Genebank has a total of 4,42,909 accessions. A total of 24 accessions of fruits, tubers, bulbs and medicinal plants were added to the In Vitro Genebank, making the total collection of 1,879 accessions in the form of ~38,000 in vitro cultures of 54 genera. In the Cryogenebank, 491 accessions of seeds, pollen and genomic resources of different crop species were successfully cryopreserved, leading to total collection of 13,814 accessions belonging to 820 species. Germplasm exchange: A total of 1,59,687 samples were imported from 40 countries including 46,145 germplasm accessions and 1,13,542 samples of CGIAR trials/nurseries. A total of 2,041 samples were exported under various collaborative research projects.
