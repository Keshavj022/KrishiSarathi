 RAPD-PCR fingerprints: Most of the random primers yielded scorable polymorphic amplified fragments in the individual of selected and control WLH chicken lines. The size of scorable amplified fragments ranged from 300 to 3,100 bp. Genetic identity index (I)- The band frequencies data were used to estimate the genetic identity index between lines. The highest genetic identity was observed between IWH and IWI lines. Garole sheep breed is being characterized by using microsatellite primers Microsatellite in double-humped camel (DH), single humped camel (SH), cattle (C), buffalo (B), sheep (S), and goat (G) LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 91 Band sharing frequency (BSF): The overall average within the BSF estimates ranged from 0.641±0.072(IWI) to 0.803±0.049 (IWC). The average BSF estimates between lines ranged from 0.580±0.051 (IWG-IWI) to 0.710±0.037 (IWC-IWJ). The medium to high estimates of BSF between lines represented the genetic relatedness among the lines taken in this study. Genetic distance (Dxy): A FORTRAN programe was developed to estimate within and between lines BSF estimates and also to calculate the genetic distance based on BSF estimates. The D estimates ranged from 0.059±0.025 to 0.122±0.040. Introgression of Major Genes associated with Tropical Productive Adaptability using DNA Based Markers A resource population from the crossing of five heterozygous Naked Neck broiler males and 20 normal feathered White Leghorn birds was generated. A panel of microsatellite markers from the markers placed on chromosome 3 was identified from the chicken genome database available of ‘CHICKMAP’ (www.ri.bbsrc.ac.uk <http://www.ri.bbsrc.ac.uk>). These microsatellite markers were used in a segregating family of 6 randomly picked progenies along with the parents. The results revealed that on 6% native PAGE, the microsatellite markers LEI 166, MCW 0040, LEI 0065 and LEI 113 seemed to be informative. Fowl: At the NBAGR, Karnal, blood samples of Aseel fowl were collected from Bastar district of Madhya Pradesh and Khaman districts adjoining Andhra Pradesh. Blood samples (60) were processed for DNA isolation and 45 DNA samples were of acceptable quality for further analysis using microsatellite primers. Blood samples from Nicobari fowl (35) were collected and processed for DNA isolation. The PCR product was resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gel for alleles and data were recorded. Genetic distancing using allelic frequencies and the dendrograms were produced. The genetic distance revealed by UPGMA method clustered the Aseel and Nicobari fowl together with the genetic distance of 0.5899 (Node 1) while the genetic distance from Miri poultry was 0.8758 (Node 2). The number of loci supporting the node were 6 out of 15 giving a value of 40% while the Node 2 was supported by all the 15 loci. The data were further analyzed using unbiased values and the genetic distances were obtained for Node 1 and 2. The values obtained were 0.5609 and 0.
