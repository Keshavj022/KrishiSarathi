 It has an average grain yield of 2,728 kg/ ha in the lower hills and 1,757 kg/ha under the mid-hill conditions. It has a maturity duration of 110 to 120 days. Mera Gaon Mera Gaurav (MGMG): Under the MGMG programme, 31 villages in 6 clusters in the Almora district were taken up. The activities carried under MGMG during the period were demonstrations of improved varieties of soybean (VL Soya 63 and VL Soya 65), rice (VL Dhan 65), ragi (VL Mandua DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 Soybean Demonstrations in Raun-Dal Villages Millet Demonstrations in Tunakot Village 324 and VL Mandua 352) and barnyard millet (VL Madira 172). Four goshthis/ meetings were conducted. Eight crop based advisories were also sent to farmers through mKisan portal and need based SMS service. Linkages between farmers and NABARD were strengthened. 119 RESEARCH FOR TRIBAL AND HILL REGIONS DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 120 EASTERN HIMALAYAS Diversification of rainfed upland rice system in the Eastern Plateau and Hill Region: Under rainfed upland conditions of Eastern Plateau and Hill Region, the experiment on diversification of direct sown upland rice was conducted during kharif 2016. The treatments were, sole crop of rice, finger millet, blackgram, horsegram, pigeonpea, vegetable cowpea, rice + blackgram in area ratio of 1:1, rice + horsegram in area ratio of 1:1, finger millet + blackgram in area ratio of 1:1 and finger millet + horsegram in area ratio of 1:1. The sole crop of vegetable cowpea recorded the maximum rice equivalent yield of 16.4 t/ha followed by that of pigeonpea (15.0 t/ha), horsegram (9.9 t/ha), blackgram (9.7 t/ha) and finger millet (6.2 t/ha). The study highlighted that the diversification of rainfed upland rice system with vegetables, pulses and millets would be more profitable in Eastern Plateau and Hill Region. Strong anti-inflammatory activity revealed in indigenous crops of Manipur: Indigenous plants (24) were screened for their inhibitory activity against Cyclooxygenase-I (COX-I) and -II (COX-II) enzyme. COX-I is constitutively expressed in cells involved in normal physiological functions, whereas COX-II is induced by various cytokines, growth factors and carcinogens. Among the plant extracts evaluated, maximum inhibition of COX-I enzyme was observed with Cuscuta reflexa (92.50%), followed by Cephalotexas (90.30%). Maximum inhibition (71.98%) was found in Rhus semialata; followed by Arisaema tortusum (61.35%) and RCM-MP-SSR-1 (51.69%). All these three plants showed the potential for development of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Radical scavenging and anti-cancer activity of Rhus semialata: For searching potential agent against reactive oxygen species, water extracts of 15 diverse indigenous crops were screened for DPPH radical scavenging activity. Among the extracts, Phylantus uranium has shown maximum activity (0.24 mg IC50 value), followed by Rhus semialata (0.40 mg IC50 value) and Paris polyphylla (0.73 mg IC50 value).
