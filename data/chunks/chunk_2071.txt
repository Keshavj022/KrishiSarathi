 By promoting sustainable farming practices, investing in rural infrastructure, and ensuring equitable access to resources, the G20 aims to create a future where no one suffers from hunger or malnutrition. The G20 works to address major global issues related to food security, nutrition, economy, financial stability, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and sustainable development. The Meeting of Agricultural Chief Scientists (MACS) in G20 is a scientific track of information exchange on the issues of utmost relevance and crucial needs for joint action in the future. The MACS 2023 has been steered by DARE-ICAR and was held with the theme of ‘Sustainable Agriculture and Food System for Healthy People and Planet’. The discussions on issues of relevance for food security especially in the context of the International Year of Millets, resilience to the crisis through climate resilient agriculture, One Health approach, and emerging issues, e.g. digital agriculture and public-private partnership for R&D were held. The meeting specifically featured Millets and Other Ancient Grains International Research Initiative (MAHARISHI) and was accepted by all member countries with emphasis on millets-based local food systems for agrobiodiversity, food and nutrition security. The outcome of the MACS 2023 has been very encouraging with all G20 Members accepting the followings: Food Security and Nutrition: Safeguard global food security and nutrition by strengthening G20 efforts towards sustainable agriculture and food systems by leveraging science, technology and innovations.
