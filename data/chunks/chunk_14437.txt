 In particular, we observed that Madhya Pradesh became the second-largest contributor to CRB and associated emissions across all states in India, which has been minimally discussed in previous studies (Deshpande et al., 2022a; Verma et al., 2019). For the decade 2011–2020, the state has shown a 300 % increase in the area under rice cultivation, from 1.70 million ha to 7.20 million ha, and a 120 % in­ crease in the area under wheat cultivation, from 4.20 million ha to 10.20 million ha, making it the largest producer of wheat in 2020. We found a similar trend in the second largest non-IGP contributor to residue burning, Rajasthan, which has shown exponential growth in wheat and cotton cultivation during our study period. Due to the high residue-to- crop ratio for cotton, Rajasthan's share in DMB from cotton residues during the Kharif season has increased from 3 % (7186 t) in 2011 to 27 % (43,440 t) in 2020. This increase in wheat and cotton area may be due to the introduction of new crop species that are more resilient to harsh environments and increased irrigation through the canal system. Other non-IGP states, such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttarak­ hand, which showed noticeable DMB, have followed a three-season cropping system. The relationship between the intensity of cropping systems and crop residue burning has been reported in many studies, indicating that the limited availability of time to prepare fields after harvest and the cost-effectiveness of CRB make it a preferred manage­ ment strategy (Bhuvaneshwari et al., 2019; Datta et al., 2020; Dutta et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2020; Sarkar et al., 2018). The seasonal rela­ tionship described in this study provides a comprehensive understand­ ing of residue burning in each state for each crop, which can help in designing targeted technology dissemination and more effective policies and market incentives (e.g., direct payments, carbon farming, etc.) to curtail CRB. Our ABA products also indicated the changes in CRB trends associ­ ated with the adoption of different agricultural technologies and policies during 2011–2020. For example, the Indian agricultural system has adopted multiple technologies to enhance production and reduce the human labour use, and prominent agrarian states like Punjab and Har­ yana practice highly mechanized farming (Grover et al., 2016; Jain et al., 2014). Use of technologies like combine harvesters, rotavators, and super seeders has revolutionized farming in India, increasing effi­ ciency and productivity while reducing human labour costs (Ramulu et al., 2023). However, studies report that using these technologies and resulting intensification have prompted farmers to burn crop residues as they are often left with large amounts of residues scattered in the field, up to 9 t.ha−1, and burning is the only option to dispose of the residue quickly and in a cost-effective manner (Dutta et al., 2022; Mittal et al., 2009; Ramulu et al., 2023).
