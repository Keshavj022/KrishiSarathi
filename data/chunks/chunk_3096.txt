 3 Average Agronomic Efficiency (kg grain/kg nutrients) of N, P, and K for different crops at Bangalore and Ranchi YIELD SUSTAINABILITY As discussed earlier, a sharp decline in crop productivity has been observed since few years after the inception of the experiment in Alfisol due to continuous imbalance nutrient use, either N alone or NP. The superimposition of P, K and FYM in 100% N treatment (original) resulted in quantum jump in yield from 5 to 31.06 q ha‐1 in finger millet and 0.8 to 16.8 q ha‐1 in maize at Bangalore (Table 5). However, application of lime over and above 100% NPK + FYM did not have any additional beneficial effect on yield of both the crops. Similarly, in 100% NP treatment, reduction in P dose and addition of K and FYM also increased the productivity of both the crops. Here, in this treatment also application of lime over and above 100% NK + 50% P + FYM did not show any beneficial effect on yield. Thus, results of superimposed treatment clearly brought out that for sustaining the productivity application of K, P, S and FYM is must. An eye on P status must be kept to avoid unnecessary built up of P. This would not only curtail expenditure on P but also minimize water pollution. The grater sustainability yield index (SYI) of all the crops (Table 6) in NPK+FYM/lime treatment is again supports the finding that to enhance and to sustain the productivity application of FYM/lime is essential along with balanced nutrition. FYM not only act as ameliorating agent but also rule out the possibility of hidden hunger of micro‐ and secondary nutrients. Whereas, application of lime also acts as an amendment and creates a conducive environment in root zone which facilitate plant root growth and availability of nutrients by controlling the soil pH. -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 AE (kg grain/kg nutrient) Hybrid Maize Wheat PALAMPUR N P K www.icar.org.in 53 2002‐2007 Table 6.

Continuous use of either N or NP or NPK without S is dangerous. To sustain the productivity balanced fertlization as per the need of crop is essential.
