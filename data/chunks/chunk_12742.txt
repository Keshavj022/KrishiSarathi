Presently, only 1.0 m MT green fodder is available against actual requirement of 4.0 m MT.   Shortage of dry fodder: At, Tripura, paddy straw is the main source of dry fodder and only 0. 62 m MT dry fodder is available against actual annual demand of 3.82 m MT.   Acute shortage of feed: Feed is one of the major inputs in the pig and poultry farming and accounts for 60-70% cost of total cost of pig and poultry farming. The important feed ingredients have marginal average at Tripura, and thus the demand of the feed is met through import from other states at huge cost. The high cost of feed make livestock farming unsustainable.   Lack of supply of good quality germplasm of poultry: More than two third poultry population is local with comparatively lower body weight and egg production (60 – 70 eggs/ layer/annum).   Inadequate Veterinary Services: The veterinary infrastructure in Tripura is inadequate in terms of both quantity as well as quality. The inadequacy of infrastructure had resulted in less access of livestock farmers to veterinary services. Again, the available facilities were mainly used for curative purposes and very less attention was being paid for the prophylactic measures.   Unscientific livestock farming: The traditional feeding and management practices in dairy, pig, goat and poultry farming are still in vogue in rural households. Livestock are maintained under unhygienic conditions with suboptimal feed, fodder and medicine.   Unorganized marketing of Livestock and livestock products.   Lack of cooperative society for collection of milk, meat and eggs.   Less awareness and training among the livestock farmers.   Lack of food processing units like milk processing unit, meat processing unit etc. · Lack of cold storage infrastructure.
