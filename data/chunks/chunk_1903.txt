 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report loT gets benefitted by a number of other technologies such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, Artificial Intelligence (Al), Machine Learning (ML), Big Data, Cloud/Edge Computing, Cellular & Non-cellular communication technologies. Research and development in these technologies will further help in creating smart infrastructure in various verticals and in turn improving the quality of life of citizens. 1.2. Machine to Machine (M2M) Communication Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication refers to the direct communication between devices or machines without human intervention. This type of communication enables devices to exchange information and perform actions based on the exchanged data. M2M communication can include industrial instrumentation, enabling a sensor or meter to communicate the information it records (such as temperature, inventory level, etc.) through a network (wireless, wired or hybrid) to application software that translates the captured event into meaningful information. Smart Application Figure 2: Machine to Machine (M2M) Communication 1.3. loT Solutions in Various Verticals loT based solutions are being used in various verticals as summarized below: 1.
