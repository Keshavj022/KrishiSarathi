 The nitrogen must be applied just before irrigation for increased nitrogen use efficiency. Harvesting Final harvesting is done similar to grain purpose wheat when the plant turns golden yellow. The grain becomes hard and the straw turns dry. The crop should be harvested when the plant attains physiological maturity and when the grain moisture percentage is around 18- 20%. The grain yield reduces by 10- 20% if not harvested on time. SUMMARY The selection of appropriate varieties, good nutrient management especially nitrogen and timely harvesting of green fodder of dual-purpose wheat is helpful to fulfill the green fodder and food security of livestock-based farming communities. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: Hardev.Ram@icar.gov.in Indian Farming 14 October 2023 Cation-based mineral supplement to prevent acidosis in dairy animals of Karnal district Shashikant Goyal1*, Gopal Sankhala1 and P P Rohilla2 1ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana 132 001 2ICAR-Agricultural Technology Application Research Institute, Zone-II, Jodhpur, Rajasthan 342 005 Negative energy balance must be minimized to improve health and fertility. Dairy animals with high genetic potentials are required to be fed on maintained and high concentrate diets to fulfil their nutritional requirements. Suddenly changing the feed from fodder to concentrates of pregnant dairy animals leads to rumen acidosis. The rumen pH comes down to 5.2 (normal 6.5 to 7.0) and this is not favorable for proper feed digestion hence called Rumen acidosis. At this pH, all rumen bacteria which helps in digestion die. Dietary cation and anion difference (DCAD) based ration feeding is another way to balance the acid-base chemistry of the dairy animals which can be altered by manipulating major anion and cation inclusion in diet. Study was designed with randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. A total of 300 farmers were selected for study after complete enumeration of seven villages. Out of 300 farmers, 210 most desirable farmers were selected for the study. A 12% increase in milk in case of buffaloes and 14.50% increase in case of cows of treated group was obtained. The net income to variable cost was more in case of buffalo rearing farmers’ (`17025) than cow rearing farmers’ (`13437).

The total livestock population in India is 535.78 million which has increased 4.6% over the previous livestock census; in which total bovine population (buffalo, cattle, mithun and yak) is 302.79 million in 2019 which increased about 1%. The total population of cattle and female cattle population was 192.49 and 145.12 million which increased 0.8% and 18.0%; respectively (Basic Animal Husbandry Statistics 2019). The total number of buffaloes in the country is 109.85 million showing 1.
