S. Ranguwal et al. Energy Nexus 11 (2023) 100238 3 KWh is kilo watt hours, HP denotes horse power, and 1 HP is equivalent to 746 W Furthermore, the sources of direct energy (DE) and indirect energy (IE) for each agricultural input were identified. DE refers to the sources that directly produce the desired energy and covers fuel (diesel), human and animal labor, and electricity. The IDE sources include agricultural equipment, pesticides, fertilizers, and seed. The various energy sources are further divided into non-renewable (NRE) and renewable (RE) sources. While NRE consists of fuel, machine usage, electricity, fertil­ izers, and chemicals, RE consists of human and animal labor, FYM, and seed [51,52]. Human and animal labor, electricity, FYM, and seed are examples of commercial energy sources, whereas fuel, fertilizers, chemicals, and agriculture machinery are examples of non-commercial energy. Weights were given to the crops based on how much of the state’s total cultivated area they occupied to calculate the ratios of various inputs to the total input energy needed for agricultural pro­ duction at the state level. 2.2. Energy indices Energy is used and produced in agriculture. The ratio analysis has been used to assess how effectively various crops transform input energy to output energy. Netenergy ( MJha−1) = Outputenergy ( MJha−1) −Inputenergy ( MJha−1) Specificenergy / EnergyIntensity ( MJkg−1) = Inputenergy(MJ)/Cropyield(Kg) Energyuseefficiency(EUE)= Outputenergy ( MJha−1) /Inputenergy ( MJha−1) 2.3. Estimation of GHGE Using the CO2 emission coefficient of the various agricultural inputs, the amount of GHG emissions throughout cropping cycles was deter­ mined (Table 2). Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) were the three main GHGEs that were fully considered. By multiplying various inputs, such as fuel, fertilizer, chemicals, FYM, and electricity, alongside their accompanying emissions, the CO2 equivalent production was computed as suggested in previous studies [58]. Through volatili­ zation and leaching of nitrogen (N), which penetrates adjacent ecosystems once they leave the field, agricultural farms directly release N2O. The CH4 emissions from the incineration of agricultural residues at the fields and the flooded paddy fields were calculated [58]. 3.
