 The SR value of MWD >2 indicates an improvement in soil quality (Franzluebbers, 2002a). Furthermore, in the current research, the SRs for all the soil depths for forest land use was >2, and for ZT, all the soil depths except surface soil (0–5:5–10) were >2. For RT, only the bottom two layers had SRs >2. In the case of CT, none of the soil layers had SR values >2. It indicates that the minimum soil disturbance-based conservation agriculture leads to improved soil Fig. 3. Depth distribution of MWD (mm) under different land use practices (Forest, ZT, RT, and CT). The bars present mean ± SD (m = 3). The different uppercase alphabets imply significant differences across treatments for a given soil depth, and the lowercase alphabets imply significant differences across the soil depths for a given treatment (P < 0.05).

However, a nonsignificant increase was observed in ZT and CT land uses (Table 1). For forest land use, except the surface layer (0–5:5–10), all the soil layers had SR >2, whereas, for ZT, the bottom two layers (0–5:20–25 and 0–5:25–30) had SR >2 and for RT, only the bottom layer (0–5:25–30) was having SR > 2. However, for the CT land use, all the soil layers had SR < 2, and no significant differences in SR were observed among layers. The SR values varied from 1.25 ± 0.22 to 3.56 ± 0.11 for forest lands, 1.72 ± 0.01 to 2.05 ± 0.12 for ZT, 1.45 ± 0.12 to 2.00 ± 0.12 for RT and 1.02 ± 0.02 to 1.23 ± 0.14 for CT. Similarly, the SR of TN also increased significantly with the increase in the soil depth for all three land uses except RT (Table 1). The forest land use had SR > 2 at (0–5:15–20) and (0–5:25–30), while ZT had SR > 2 at (0–5:25–30). However, the RT and CT had SR < 2 for all the soil layers. The ZT land use had significantly higher SR values than RT and CT for all the soil layers, although there was no significant difference between RT and CT. It implies that soil quality improves more rapidly under CA than under CT. Hence the adoption of conservation agriculture will enhance soil health. It was observed that converting land use to CT reduced the SR of SOM drastically. However, by adopting CA, the SR had been restored to near-normal in forest land use. The highest SR of SOC and TN in forests and CA are in line with the observations of other trials (Franzluebbers, 2002a; Xue et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2015; Patra et al., 2019a), which indicate better sequestration of SOM and thereby improvement of soil quality in forest and CA practices over CT (Zhao et al., 2015). Due to the continuous build-up of higher SOM in the sur­ face layer, the SR of SOM was higher in forest and CA land use compared to CT land uses (Franzluebbers, 2002a; Zhao et al., 2015; Chao et al., 2019).
