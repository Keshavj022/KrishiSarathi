 Some general rules for watering potted orchids 1. While watering, grower should be careful to look after the matter that, the potting material should never be soggy. Potted plants must be sufficiently watered to prevent them from becoming bone dry. 2. In general, watering once in a week is optimum, but small pots (5” or less) need more frequent watering than large pots (6” or more). 3. Different potting materials and different sized potting materials will dry at different rates. Clay pots will evaporate more water than plastic pots when other factors are constant, so clay pots will dry faster than plastic pots. Clay orchid pots, because of their openings, will dry out faster than regular clay pots. So orchid pots needs regular monitoring, by regular monitoring one can gain experience and can provide optimum water to orchids. 4. Finally, temperature, light, air conditioning and heating will influence the drying rates of potting material. Watering habits should be adjusted, as the season changes. 5. By a thumb rule method, one can insert his/her finger an inch or two in the potting media and feel the moisture condition of it, it should be moist not soggy, if not moist, need to add water to moisten it, and if it is soggy; it should be kept for drying. 6. During watering, some water may get in between leaves or new growth. If this water stays there overnight, it may promote the growth of bacteria and fungi that may harm or kill orchids or the new growth of the orchid. To reduce this risk, sound watering practices should be adopted, like   Orchid should be watered only on sunny days. If the weather is cool, cloudy or rainy, wait for a day or two before watering.   Watering should be done early in the day. This will allow water (that got in between leaves or new growth) to evaporate before nightfall. Watering should be stopped before 2 PM in the summer, before 12 noon in the winter and before 1 PM in the spring.   Orchids should be watered with room temperature water or lukewarm water. Because a difference of 10 degrees or more between the temperature of the water and the room temperature may cause injuries to the plants. 7. Watering should be done from the top, and it should continue till the water runs freely through the drainage holes, or the plant may be immersed in water up to 1/2” or so below the rim and it may be allowed to absorb water for 10 minutes or so. 8. Water splashed on the leaves or in between the leaves should be wiped out. Using a straw is a convenient way to flow air and blow out water from in between leaves. March–April 2021 23 Common method of fertilizing orchids In a 30-10-10 fertilizer formulation, 30% of the total content is nitrogen 10% phosphorous and 10% potassium. Nitrogen derived from urea is not readily available to orchid plants, so urea should not be used as an N source to orchids. Also organic fertilizers are not well suited for orchids. Application of silicon to orchids improves heat and drought tolerance.
