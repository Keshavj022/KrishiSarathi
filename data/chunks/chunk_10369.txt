 2020) and Avena sterilis ssp ludoviciana (Dur.) in wheat were determined through models. Other significant achievements included impact of climate change on weeds, biology and control measures of Orobanche, weedy rice problem and management, understanding crop weed-fertilizer-water interactions and their implications for weed management in agricultural systems for doubling farmersâ€™ income (Rao et al. 2020). 5.2. Herbicide recommendations Generally, phenoxyalkanoic acids in 1940s; carbamates (thiocarbamates) in 1950s (1954 onwards); phenylureas in 1950s (1951 onwards); dinitroanilines in 1950s (1955 onwards); acetamides in 1950s (1956 onwards); triazines (symmetrical triazines) in 1950s (1956 onwards); uracils in 1960s (1962 onwards); aryloxyphenoxypropionates (APPs) in 1970s (mainly in the late 1970s and early 1980s); imidazolinones in the 1970-80s; sulfonylureas in 1980s were developed/reported in the world. Candidate herbicides of these respective groups were commercially used contemporarily to these years or later. Initially non-selective inorganic herbicides like sodium chlorate (NaClO3) were used in the world and to a limited scale in India for weed control in bunds, roadsides, and non-crop situations. Then came several selective herbicides for weed control in cropped situations. These herbicides were used in higher doses, usually in kg/ha like triazines (atrazine, simazine, propazine, cynazine, ametryn, prometryn, etc.), dinitroanilines (pendimethalin, fluchloralin, trifluralin etc.), phenylureas (diuron, linuron, isoproturon, chlortoluron etc.), phenoxyalkanoic acids (2,4-D, MCPA, etc.). Recently, there has been a tremendous shift in herbicide molecules, called novel herbicides, having specific mode of action. They include imidazolinones (imazamethabenz, imazapyr, imazaquin, imazethapyr, imazamox), sulfonylureas (halosulfuron-methyl, pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, nicosulfuron, flazasulfuron, sulfosulfuron, chlorimuron-ethyl, bensulfuron-methyl, primisulfuron-methyl, sulfometuron-methyl, chlorsulfuron, metsulfuron-methyl, triasulfuron, tribenuron-methyl), pyrimidinylthiobenzoates (pyrithiobac-Na, bispyribac- Na, pyriminobac-methyl), triazolopyrimidines (penoxsulam, pyroxsulam, flumetsulam, cloransulam-methyl, diclosulam, metosulam), which are recommended at lower doses, have high potency and lower residual toxicity. 5.3. Integrated weed management Cultural and mechanical practices were evaluated and included into the packages of integrated weed management programmes (Das et al. 2012). The utilization of weeds such as Lantana camara, Eupatorium odoratum, Parthenium hysterophorus, Eichhornia crassipes for compost/green manure/soil mulch in several crops and cropping systems was explored. Integrated weed management practices were also developed for several crops across regions.
