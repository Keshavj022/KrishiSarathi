 During the reporting period, 260,659 semen doses were produced and 189,530 semen doses were sold/used and the closing balance was 777,709 semen doses of Murrah breed. Progeny testing in Murrah breed is carried out at participating institutions DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 60 LIVESTOCK IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 61 Balance stock of frozen semen of buffalo bulls other than Murrah breed is 213,094 doses. Performance of participating Murrah herds: The herd strength of associated Murrah herds was 2,041, which includes 1,067 breedable buffaloes. During the period under report, 16 bulls of 17th set were used for test mating. The weighted average of 305 days lactation milk yield in Murrah buffalo revealed an overall 58.98% improvement since inception of the project in 1993. The weighted average for age at first calving and service period were 43.37 months and 140.02 days, respectively. The weighted wet average of Murrah buffalo was reported the highest (8.37 kg) since inception of the project and revealed an overall 57.83% improvement since 1992–93. Goat Jamunapari goats for better body growth: The average body weight of Jamunapari goats under intensive management at 12 months of age was 38.74 kg and the highest body weight observed was as 45.5 kg. The average daily weight gain (ADG) of the kids under intensive management was 113.38, 167.73 and 114.97 g/day, respectively, during 3–9, 6–9, and 6–12 months. Requirement of breeding bucks: Multiplier flocks of Barbari goats were developed in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttarakhand for genetic improvement, conservation and promoting scientific goat farming among educated youths and farmers. Interventions were provided for development of livelihood models. Multiplier flock at Patna, Bihar Increasing protein percentage in goat milk: The effects of CSN1S1 polymorphism on milk production and composition traits were analysed in different breeds. The total casein content of goat milk is positively correlated with these allelic variants of CSNIS1 and was higher for A, B and C alleles. The goats homozygous for E or F allele produce milk with low protein, fat content, and cheese yield. The tropical goats are producing lesser milk as compared to temperate breeds, however, the milk casein locus carries higher frequency of A and B alleles. The effect of genotype was established with milk composition traits and milk yield in Jamunapari goat population. CSN1S1 polymorphic pattern provides an opportunity to select and breed goats for producing milk with desired protein content. Sheep Network Project on Sheep Improvement: The aim of this project is genetic evaluation and continuous improvement of indigenous sheep breeds through selection for better growth and wool production. Presently, there are six ongoing cooperating centres with its coordinating unit at ICAR-CSWRI, Avikanagar. Four of these units are farm based units while two are field based units.
