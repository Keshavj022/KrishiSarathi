 The time taken to complete one girdling (2–3 mm depth and 3–4 mm width) operation with the tool is 2–4 min as compared to 15 min with traditional knife. It was also demonstrated to litchi farmers in Muzaffarpur district for its popularization and adoption. Pollinator for greenhouse Greenhouse provides a desired climatic condition for crops but at the same time, has obstacles for natural pollination. A pollinator was designed on the principle of a pulsating air jet for pollination. Three pulsation units (3D printed) were used to provide varied air pulsation frequency and angular movement to cover the complete flower bed. An operator in the greenhouse alleys can easily move the unit. The developed unit is compared with hand pollination and pollination by a blower in tomato crops. The highest pollination efficiency (83.66%) was achieved at 1.99 m3/min airflow rate, 23.50 Hz pulsation frequency and exposure time of 19.40 sec; an average yield of 19.52 kg was observed at 1.99 m3/min of airflow rate, 22.25 Hz of pulsation frequency and exposure time of 15.78 sec in flowers of 5 m length sections. The yield was also higher with developed pollinators compared to pollination by a blower (36.6%) and controlled plot (95.7%). Cost of the pollinator is ` 15,000 and cost of operation is ` 400/ha as compared to `1,500/ha with manual hand pollination. Health hazards of workers in rice/flour mill The major problems in rice huller are noise and dust. The workers are mostly exposed to dust generated, which causes pulmonary diseases, eye irritation, nose conjunction, choking of throats, etc. Some of the workers cover the face with cotton clothes. Dust concentration in the rice mill at different distance is 1, 2, 3 and 4 m from the feeding site and found value of PM2.5 (mg/m3) is 362, 348, 293, 282 and 264 respectively. Similarly value of PM10 (mg/m3) is 466, 442, 360, 341 and 322 respectively. A dust-arresting chamber was fixed in one of the rice-hulling unit so that dust can be arrested and thrown out. The intervention can reduce the dust concentration by 22%. Even then dust concentration level was more than safe limit. It is recommended that workers should use dust mask for proper safety. Bullock drawn 4-row seed drill for millets In Odisha, small and marginal farmers generally use manual broadcasting method for sowing of small seeds MECHANIZATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 101 (finger millet, small millet, sorghum; mustard, sesamum, linseed) after ploughing under upland condition. A four row bullock drawn seed drill for millets was developed. Cost of a seed drill is `22,000. The effective field capacity of seed drill is 0.12 ha/h at 1.85 km/h speed for sowing of finger millet. The draught and power requirement of the equipment are 378 N and 0.206 kW, respectively, which are within the draughtability of a pair of bullock/ buffalo. Animal drawn straw collector An animal drown straw collector was developed.
