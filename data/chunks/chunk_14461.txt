 However, due to high tempera­ tures and unpredictable rainfall, agricultural lands have been under severe stress. Due to climatic variables, the croplands of ACZ I and ACZ III are experiencing severe vegetal degradation and have had a negative impact on crop vegetative growth. The VCI derived from the NDVI is shown in Fig. 4, which also demonstrated that ACZ I and III often have the lowest VCI values. The maximum seasonal LST of 32.88 ◦C was recorded in the years 2005–06 in the southwestern part (Haryana) of the study area, and temperatures in this part remained high during the entire period of investigation. The minimum seasonal LST, i.e., 16.55 ◦C and 16.56 ◦C, Fig. 3. Spatio-temporal representation of Standard Precipitation Index (SPI-12) from 2001-02 to 2019-2020. L. Kaur et al. Agricultural Water Management 274 (2022) 107956 8 was observed in the years 2018–19 and 2019–20, mainly in the northern part (Punjab). The spatial extent of LST < 20 ◦C was prevalent in the major part of the study area during 2011–12 and 2018–19, while LST > 26 ◦C prevailed over the study area during the years from 2001–02 to 2005–06, 2008–09, 2009–10, and 2015–16. In general, the LST in the northwestern part of the study area remained low, while LST was usually high in the southwestern part. The lowest value of TCI depicts the driest soil moisture conditions, while high values of TCI reflect the wet con­ ditions. The lowest TCI, i.e., > 40.0, was mainly prevalent in ACZ I in most of the years. ACZ II had the lowest TCI (<31) in its major part in 2014–15, while ACZ III and some parts of ACZ II had low TCI (<32) in 2016–17 (Fig. 5). The spatial distribution maps of Vegetation Health Index (VHI) derived from the weighted linear combination of VCI and TCI, given in Fig. 6. Despite the fact that the majority of the study area did not exhibit a drought (VHI > 40) condition during the period of this study, ACZ I consistently exhibited low VHI values. The linear relationship between VCI and TCI, the omission of a normalizing component for the compu­ tation of VHI from VCI and TCI and classification thresholds may explain why VHI did not reflect drought conditions in ACZ II and ACZ III. Fig. 7 shows the spatial distribution of mean GPP over the selected agro-climatic zones of Punjab and Haryana for wheat growing season. GPP was significantly higher in ACZ II from 2001-02 to 2007-08, while its lowest values were observed in ACZ I for the same time period. From Fig. 4.

Since GPP is sensitive to dry and wet conditions (Wang et al.
