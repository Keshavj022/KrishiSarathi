5 ha/day at 3–4 km/hr speed DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 136 Wheat raised-bed planter. Its cost of operation with 45-hp tractor for fresh beds is estimated at Rs 200/hr. With this, wheat yields obtained were 4.48 tonnes/ha, compared to 4.08 tonnes/ha of flat sowing Modified PAU self-propelled rice transplanter. The estimated cost of the machine is Rs 70,000 as against Rs 120,000 of the imported unit Modified sprouted rice transplanter. Seeding of sprouted rice with 4-row seeder has been found 70.8% labour-, 87.11% energy- and 83.67% cost-effective compared to mechanized trans- planting of seedlings Tractor-mounted sugarcane trash-shedder. Its soil-mixing blades dig soil from the sides of the ridges and mix it with chopped trash. Due to its soil digging, fibrous roots of stubbles could be removed; which is useful for the ratoon-crop Tractor-mounted hydraulically-opeated hoist for harvesting mango, guava, sapota and coconut. It is safe and stable in operation, and easy to transport, and its cost of operation is Rs 336/hr FARM IMPLEMENTS AND MACHINERY AT A GLANCE AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY 137 A commercial straw combine for straw harvesting has been field evaluated. It is recommended for faster collection of chopped straw from combine-harvested wheat field Tractor-operated straw-chopper-cum- spreader. For rice-straw management, a tractor-operated, straw-chopping machine has been developed. The machine chops straws of 5-cm length and spreads it in the field. Its capacity is 4 ha/day Tractor-mounted turmeric digger. It could dig turmeric bulbs from 12-cm depth with 4% bulb damage FARM IMPLEMENTS . . . AT A GLANCE (continued) DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 138 Raised-bed Planter for Planting Wheat The effective field capacity of the raised-bed planter for fresh beds was 0.2 ha/ hr, and its cost of operation with 45-hp tractor was Rs 200 per hour. And its time, cost and operational energy used per hectare with preparatory tillage were found 17.61, 22.83 and 19.70% higher than flat sowing. Three rows of wheat were planted shallow (depth of planting = 40 mm) at the inter-row spacing of 150 mm on each bed with 80 kg/ha seed rate and N : P : K at 90 : 30 : 15 kg/ha, based on the soil test. The peformance of the bed-planted wheat was found superior to flat sowing in respect of growth, active tillers and yield. The yield of the bed-planted wheat was 4.48 tonnes/ha compared to 4.08 tonnes/ha in flat sowing. Wheat planting on permanent beds was more advantageous than fresh beds with preparatory tillage and flat sowing with conventional tillage.
