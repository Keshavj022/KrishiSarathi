 B K Singh*, Bhuvaneswari S, Pradip Karmakar, B Singh and P M Singh Research Field view of Kashi Gobhi-25 Curd of Kashi Gobhi-25 Indian Horticulture 18 Kashi Gobhi-25 in farmer’s field to initiate bolting, flowering and seed development. The curds are developed during last week of October to first fortnight of November in Varanasi conditions at 22-27°C and suitable for raising nursery during 4th week of July to 2nd week of August followed by transplanting of 25- 30 days old seedlings. It can be transplanted 15-20 days earlier in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab due to prevalence of required temperature. The curd of this variety is ready to harvest in 65-70 days after transplanting. The frame size is medium with 55-58 cm, and average curd size varies from 9.5-11.0 cm in length and 12.5-14.5 cm in breadth. The marketable curds weigh about 500-600 g, hemispherical in shape, whitish in colour and medium-compact. The variety is adapted to warm weather and curds are free from riceyness, leafiness and fuzziness. The potential yield of the variety is 22-25 t/ha. Kashi Gobhi-25 has also been performing very well in the farmer’s field of Robertsganj, Sonbhadra, UP during last week of October, having average marketable curd weight of 550-700 g, about 15 days earlier than the commercial hybrid and earned net return of ` 75,000 per acre. Cultivation practices Kashi Gobhi-25 is grown in soil with good fertility and good moisture regime, especially loam. The soil having pH range of 6.0-7.0 with higher organic matter content and good drainage is suitable. Nursery raising of the crop is recommended from last week of July to second week of August. Soil solarisation for 20-40 days during May-June, and need based drench of the nursery bed with mancozeb+metalaxyl 72% WP @ 0.2% or mancozeb 75% WP @ 1.0% and or Al-Fosetyl 80% WP @ 0.1% is recommended to avoid the incidence of damping-off. The recommended seed rate is 350-450 g/ha. Transplanting of 25-30 days old seedlings to be taken up in last week of August to second week of September with spacing of 50 cm between rows and 45-50 cm between plants. Recommended NPK requirement is 120:60:50 kg/ha along with borax @ 15 kg/ha as basal application or 0.2- 0.5% as foliar spray and ammonium molybdate @ 2 kg/ha as basal or 0.02-0.03% as foliar spray. Transplanting on ridges is recommended for proper drainage of rainwater. Plant protection Tobacco caterpillar (Spodoptera litura) is the major pest attacking cauliflower. Spraying NPV @ 250 LE/ha in evening, need based alternate spray of insecticides like indoxacarb 14.5 SC @ 250 ml/ha or chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC @ 50 ml/ha or cyantraniliprole 10 OD @ 600 ml/ha or spinosad 2.5 SC @ 15-18 ml/ha is recommended to control the pest. Alternaria leaf spot is a major disease in the crop. To check the disease, adopting crop rotation with a minimum two year rotation with non-crucifer crops is recommended. To control the disease, foliar spray with diafenconazole 25% WP @ 0.
