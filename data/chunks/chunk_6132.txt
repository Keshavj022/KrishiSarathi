Water stored in polythelene-lined tank terracing and trenching. Trenching enhanced water conservation through harvesting the run- off water and the water directly from the rains and snow. Terracing alone was also effective in conserving moisture by directing the flow of run- off towards plant basins. Terracing and trenching Contents RAIN WATER MANAGEMENT thus should be practised in rainfed orchards for harvesting and conserving rain water in situ. Effect of mulching The effect of mulching on soil-moisture conservation is shown in Table 5. Mulching retained more soil moisture than no-mulch.
