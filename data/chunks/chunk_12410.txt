No. Technology Title Brief Description 1. Soil and Water Conservation technologies on Sloping Land for fruit and plantation crops In cashew, Continuous contour trenches with Stylosanthes scabra and Vetiveria zizanioides reduced runoff by 44.5% under 4 m × 4 m spacing. 2 Biological control for plant health management in Coastal regions.   Application of talc formulation of bacterial antagonists in nursery (50g/m2) and while planting (1.25g/plant) reduced the incidence of bacterial wilt in brinjal.   Application of talc formulation of Trichoderma to the seedlings (1.25g/plant) reduced the incidence of Fusarial wilt in watermelon.   Application of talc formulation of bacterial antagonists and Trichoderma during planting (50g/plant/year) reduced the incidence of foot rot in black pepper.   Application of talc formulation of bacterial antagonists in nursery (50g/m2) and while planting (1.25g/plant) reduced the incidence of soil borne diseases in chilli.   Application of bio agents improved the growth and increased the yield in the above crops. 3 Heliconia as intercrop in coconut makes coconut farming more profitable in Goa Heliconia- an exotic introduced flower crop performed extremely well under coconut plantation for three years. The study included 45 varieties of heliconia under coconut garden for various vegetative and floral characters. The flowers were supplied to the market and the feedback from the market is documented to short list the most promising heliconia types with high floral value. 4 Turmeric production Technology for Goa Improved turmeric varieties were introduced, evaluated and standardized commercial production under Agro-climatic conditions of Goa which eventually resulted in recommendation of improved varieties like Prabha, Pratibha, Kedaram, Alleppey and Megha turmeric -1 for commercial production. Production technology is standardized. This technology is now taking off in the state of Goa both as pure crop and also as intercrop in cashew and coconut plantations.
