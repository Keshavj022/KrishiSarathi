 Besides, 8 open- pollinated and 8 hybrids have been identified under AICRP for release. These include PMR 57/88 K in chilli, NDBG 104 in bottle gourd, CM 20 and PCUC 28 in cucumber, NDVP 250 (resistant to powdery mildew) in mid-season pea, DMDR 2 in muskmelon, VRO 4 (resistant to YVMV) in okra and CHES 309 (resistant to BW) in brinjal. Hybrid BH 1 in brinjal (round), DTH 8 and CHTH 1 in tomato (determinate), ARTH 128 in tomato (indeterminate), Sungro 86-235 in chilli, Lario in capsicum, MHY 5 in muskmelon and DVR 4 in okra were identified for release. Female sex associated RAPD marker in pointed gourd has been identified. The marker could be used in breeding programme to screen the gender of plants at seedling stage. Five bitter gourd populations with very high proportion of pistilate flowers (>90%) have been developed from gynoecious lines. Development of such populations will be useful in hybrid seed production. Raising of hybrid seedlings of tomato, viz. Apoorva in potting plugs at Kanpur, ARTH 3 in polybags at Coimbatore and Avinash 2 in polybags at Varanansi has been recommended. Planting of tomato hybrid ARTH 4 at 80 cm × 45 cm along with staking and pinching of side branches at 30 cm from ground gave highest yield (372.4 q/ha) and maximum C : B ratio (1 : 2.8) at Sabour. However, the same hybrid at the above spacing and without pinching gave highest yield (470.8 q/ha) and C : B ratio of 1 : 2.9 at Ambajogai. Hybrid Avinash 2 at 50 cm × 30 cm spacing along with staking and maintaining single shoot per plant gave 1,227.0 q/ha yield under low-cost polyhouse at Pantnagar. Application of 20 tonnes FYM + half recommended dose of NPK (150 : 80 : 100 kg/ha) in tomato hybrid Avinash 2 gave maximum yield (773.0 q/ha) and C : B ratio (1 : 4.0), at Varanasi. At Faizabad, maximum yield (332.05 q/ha) and C : B Bottle gourd DVBG 1 Bitter gourd DVBTG 1 IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF HORTICULTURAL CROPS 59 ratio (1 : 3.45) of tomato Narendra Tamato 2 was recorded with green manuring + recommended dose of NPK (60 : 30 : 30 kg/ha) when seedlings were transplanted at 60 cm × 45 cm. The highest yield (346.87 q/ha) and C : B ratio (1 : 2.35) were obtained with the application of FYM @ 20 tonnes/ha + recommended dose of NPK (150 : 60 : 60 kg/ha) in tomato S 7 at Sabour. Highest dry yield of 16.4 q/ha of chilli G 2 was obtained under fertilizer dose of 240 kg N + 60 kg P2O5 + 60 kg K2O at Hybderabad. Application of 75% of recommended N dose (150 kg/ha) + Azospirillum as seed treatment, seedling dip and soil incorporation at Varanasi gave maximum yield of green chilli LCA 235 (117.52 q/ha) along with maximum C : B ratio (1 : 1.77) followed by application of 50% recommended dose of N + Azospirillum. Application of Azotobactor as seed treatment, seedling dip and soil application of 75% recommended dose of N (140 kg/ha) in cabbage Pride of India gave maximum yield (379.0 q/ha) and C : B ratio (1 : 3.4) at Pantnagar. Similar results were also obtained at Hyderabad.
