The Sahyadri mountain ranges provide a natural backbone to the State on the west, while the Satpuda hills along the north and Bhamragad- Chiroli- Gaikhuri ranges on the east serve as its natural borders. The State is surrounded by Gujarat to the northwest, Madhya Pradesh to the north, Chhattisgarh to the east, Telangana to the south east, Karnataka to the south and Goa to the south west. Maharashtra is the second largest state in India in terms of population and has geographical area about 3.08 lakh sq. km. As per Population Census-2011, the population of the State is 11.24 crore which is 9.3 per cent of the total population of India and is highly urbanised with 45.2 per cent people residing in urban areas. Agriculture is major occupation of the people in Maharashtra. Both food and cash crops are grown in the State. Maharashtra is spread over 9.4 % of the geographical area of the nation and hosts about 9.3% of the population of the country. About 7.4 % of the rural population and 13.5% of the urban population of the country reside in Maharashtra. Literacy rate in the state is 82.3 which is slightly more than the national average. Net area sown to various crops in the state is about 12.3 % while gross area sown accounts for 11.3 % as compared to the corresponding figures at the national level. The state contributes 55.4, 34.6, 21.9 and 10% of the area sown to sorghum, cotton, sugarcane, and the bajra respectively. However, contributes only 6.2 % to the national livestock population. About 9.3% of the national electricity is produced by the state but consumption is about 13.9% indicating that the state faces electricity problems. Diversity of agriculture in Maharashtra is largely influenced by rainfall ranging from 500 to 6000 mm rain and diverse types of soil with varying level of water holding capacity. Since more than 12 ICAR institutes and 5 SAUs are in action and hence there is scope to address the issues relevant to doubling the farmers income in concerted manner. In addition to crops, livestock can play a significant role in enhancing the farmerâ€™s income if the marketing channel is streamlined. While substantial areas are covered by fruits and vegetables, a small proportion of cultivated land is devoted for floriculture. In order to maximize the production from the available resources and prevailing climatic conditions, need-based, location specific technologies need to be generated. Delineation of agro-climatic zones based on soil, water, rainfall, temperature etc. is the first essential step for sustainable production.
