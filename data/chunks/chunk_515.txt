 As a result, we can anticipate the invasion of new and aggressive insects, diseases, and weeds that pose threats to our crops. Temperature fluctuations significantly impact vegetable crops, affecting growth, yield and quality. To counter these effects, farmers and researchers must account for temperature sensitivities, adjusting cultivation and mitigation strategies accordingly. Flooding: Flooding jeopardizes vegetable crops as it deprives their roots of oxygen, impairing vital processes of the crops. Nutrient absorption is hindered, stunting growth or causing plant demise. Tomatoes for instance, face heightened ethylene production due to flooding-induced low oxygen. This stress elevates l-amino- cyclo-propene-l-carboxylic acid, a precursor to ethylene, compounding the threat by further impacting oxygen and nutrient availability. Drought: Most vegetables are highly sensitive to drought, with over 90% water content, making them prone to water scarcity effects. Drought leads to significant yield reductions as plant cells undergo changes that lower water potential, damaging cell membranes and disrupting processes like photosynthesis. Drought’s timing, intensity and duration affect vegetable production, especially during flowering and edible part development stages. Stress during these critical periods can cause substantial production losses. If climatic factors such as rainfall undergo significant changes in a particular region, surpassing the tolerance levels of the species inhabiting it, the natural distribution pattern of those species may be disrupted and altered. Salinity: Salinity is a significant problem affecting crop productivity in India and worldwide. The increasing salinity in the soil threatens vegetable production, especially in irrigated farmland, which is crucial in supplying 40% of the world’s food. The excessive presence of salts in the soil negatively impacts the growth and yield of various vegetables at different stages of their development. Onions are highly susceptible to saline soils, while crops like cucumbers, eggplants, peppers and tomatoes show moderate sensitivity. Under extreme temperature conditions, when evapotranspiration is high, there is a substantial loss of water, leaving behind salt deposits around Factors affecting vegetable crops due to change in climate Indian Farming 27 September 2023 the roots of plants. These salt deposits interfere with the plant’s ability to absorb water, leading to adverse effects. The plants experience a loss of turgor pressure, reduced growth, wilting, curling of leaves, shedding of leaves, decreased photosynthesis, changes in respiration, compromised protective outer layer (cuticle), tissue necrosis and in severe cases, even death. The detrimental effects of salt stress on plants result in visible symptoms and physiological changes that ultimately lead to reduced crop productivity.
