 OIE recognized the country free from rinderpest infection in the year 2006 and finally, global eradication of rinderpest was declared by FAO in the year 2011. To mark this stupendous achievement which ushered an era of agricultural revolution in the country, ICAR-IVRI installed a commemoration pillar at its Mukteswar campus on 2nd June, 2012. The pillar depicts important landmark achievements made possible through contributions of all national and international organizations (Fig. 2). The successful implementation of rinderpest eradication programme has yielded major economic benefits which enhanced food and nutrition security. It was observed that investment made in NREP launched in 1954 yielded net benefit and significant increase in growth rates in milk production. National Programme on Rinderpest Eradication (NPRE) was launched in 1991-92, to eradicate rinderpest following the pathway prescribed by World Organization of Animal Health/ OIE. The benefits of NPRE can be appreciated from the increased access of India’s bovine meat and milk in the international market (Rich et al. 2012). Indeed, Indian exports of bovine milk picked up substantially around 1992-94 and simultaneously India’s dependence on milk imports also reduced drastically at the same time (Bardhan 2007). These developments ultimately contributed enormously to White Revolution and enhanced per capita availability of milk in the country. The growth rate and economic benefits during rinderpest control and eradication is depicted in Table 2. As against the huge economic benefits accrued from rinderpest eradication in India, the expenditure on rinderpest vaccine research and production was estimated to be Rs. 47,856 million (1063.46 million US$) over a period of 92 years from 1913 to 2005 (Yadav 2011). The FAO estimated that India gained additional food production valuing 289 billion US dollars between 1965-1998 (Yadav et al. 2016). Fig. 2.

Growth rate and economic benefits during rinderpest control and eradication Parameters Growth rate/benefits 1.a. Growth rates in milk production (1961 to 1983) 1.b. Growth rates in milk production (1983 to 2016) 3.11% per annum 4.66% per annum 2a. Net benefit during NREP (1956/57) 2b. Net benefit during NPRE (1994/95) Rs. 1576 million Rs. 6933 million 3. Net benefits accrued to the nation during 1992/93 to 2015/16 Rs. 4619 million per annum 4. Net Present Value of rinderpest eradication Rs. 34.63 billion 5. Benefit Cost Ratio of NPRE (BCR) 4.37 There have also been several indirect benefits of rinderpest eradication, which include capacity building in terms of human resource development, development of disease surveillance and diagnostic infrastructure, acquisition of vehicles and equipment, establishment of epidemiology units, creation of a wide network of veterinary departments and research institutes.
