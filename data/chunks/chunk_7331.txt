 Plant quarantine: A total of 124,152 samples were processed (122,842 under import and 1,310 for export) comprising germplasm accessions, nurseries/trial breeding material of various crops including both true seed and vegetative propagules for quarantine clearance. Of these, 5,443 samples were subjected to X-ray radiography. A total of 1,272 samples were infested/ infected with different pests; 1,184 samples were salvaged through physico-chemical methods and 88 samples were rejected due to fungal and viral pathogens, and insects of quarantine importance. Important interceptions included—fungi Claviceps purpurea in barley from Morocco, Tilletia barclayana in rice from China, Bipolaris maydis in maize from Thailand; insects Bruchus ervi and B. dentipes on Lens culinaris and Vicia faba, respectively, from Lebanon; nematodes Aphelenchoides besseyi on Oryza sativa from China, Philippines and USA, Tylenchorhynchus sp. on Persea americana imported from Kenya; and weeds Bromus secalinus, Echinochloa crus-pavonis and Lolium rigidum. A total of 665 samples of exotic germplasm of various legume crops were grown in PEQ greenhouses, and indexed for viruses; and 25 viruses were detected and intercepted, viz. ArMV, BBWV, BCMV, BCMNV, BPMV, BYMV, CLRV, CMV, CMMoV, CPMV, GFLV, HPV, MCMV, PMMoV, PepMV, PSV, RpRSV, SBMV, SMV, TBRV, TBSV TRSV, TSV, ToMV and ToRSV. Ten viruses, viz. BPMV, CLRV, HPV, MCMV, PMMoV, PepMV, PSV, RpRSV, TBSV and ToRSV are not reported to occur in India and are quarantine pests for India. This resulted in rejection of 61 accessions including soybean (41), chilli (2), corn (1) and tomato Drone-view of cowpea germplasm characterization at Issapur farm of ICAR- NBPGR Variability in cucumber germplasm characterized and maintained at NBPGR, RS, Thrissur, Kerala GENETIC RESOURCES ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 20 (17). The harvest of the virus-free plants was released to the indenters. In addition, 19 PEQ inspections of exotic germplasm of barley (4,651), carrot (29), chickpea (1,350), corn (4,951), chilli (255), faba bean (471), grass pea (326), lentil (2,157), soybean (792), tomato (1,130) and wheat (14,723) were undertaken at indenter’s sites. A total of 14,928 seed samples were subjected to prophylactic treatment with fumigation; 2,642 samples of paddy were given mandatory hot water treatment; 1,153 vegetative propagules were also given prophylactic pesticidal dips treatment and 608 samples of Capsicum spp. and Solanum lycopersicum were treated with tri-sodium orthophosphate (10%). A total of 19 post-entry quarantine inspections were carried out by Plant Quarantine scientists for imported consignments. About 1,360 samples were processed for export after issuing 8 Phytosanitary certificates. Seed health testing for pest-free conservation: A total of 4,906 indigenous samples including 139 cryo samples were processed for pest-free conservation.
