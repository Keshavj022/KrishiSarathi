  TECHNOLOGIES AND INITIATIVES FOR FARMERS’ WELFARE i FOREWORD The Indian Council of Agricultural Research under the governance regime of the Department of Agricultural Research and Education, Govt. of India has been pioneering in the science-led growth and development of Indian agriculture. Taking this endeavor forward, the organization was able to achieve rapid strides in the development of new varieties of field and horticultural crops including 52 biofortified varieties to impart food and nutritional security. Our new varieties, particularly in pulses enabled higher varietal replacement; availability of high-quality seeds of such varieties contributed significantly to the pulses revolution during 2016-19. Further, rising to the national commitment for conservation and improvement of indigenous animal breeds, 41 animal breeds including poultry were registered We focused on development of new vaccines and diagnosis kits for efficient management of animal diseases and increasing animal productivity. Towards Blue Revolution, induced breeding technologies were standardized with a focus on ornamental fishes; promoted open-sea cage farming by providing technology backstopping, and developed as well as commercialized several nutraceutical/health products from sea-weeds. Minilab for soil testing at affordable price - its development and deployment, was a milestone in the area of soil health assessment. New integrated and organic farming system models were developed. Upscaling of our IFS models by state governments of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in thousands of farmers fields was noteworthy. We strengthened the process of accreditation of agricultural universities/ colleges to ensure high-quality higher agricultural education and took measures to attract talented students to agricultural education and research. Implementation of the Fifth Deans’ Committee Report and National Higher Education Project brought greater emphasis on skill and entrepreneurship ii development in our students. We intensified our efforts in development and use of ICTs to reach as many farmers as possible particularly through the energized KVK system.
