Role of intrinsic motivation and government policies in adoption of sustainable agriculture practices by farmers in Maharashtra, India Deepika Swami a,*, Devanathan Parthasarathy b a Department of Sustainable Energy Engineering, Chandrakanta Kesavan Centre for Energy Policy and Climate Solutions, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India b Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Maharashtra, India A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords: Agricultural sustainability Sustainable agriculture practices Environmental beneﬁts Structural equation modeling Institutional and behavioural factors A B S T R A C T Indian agriculture system is facing severe crisis due to multiple stressors, including climate change, excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides, poor socio-economic condition of farmers and water scarcity. Adoption of sustainable form of agriculture is one of the remedies to deal with these stressors. Despite this, adoption of Sustainable Agriculture Practices (SAPs) is quite limited among farmers, which necessitates understanding the factors driving farmers’ adoption of SAPs. So far, studies have majorly prioritized socio-economic and demographic variables and lack comprehensive understanding of institutional and behavioural factors towards adoption of SAPs by farming community. Current research aims to address the underlying gaps, by focusing on understanding the contribution of institutional, attitudinal and perceptual factors manifesting in attitude and perception.
