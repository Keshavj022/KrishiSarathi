 Variation in yield obtained with farmer’s practice was 0.4 to 1.02 tonnes/ ha. Increase in yield under demonstration over the yield of farmers’ practice (local check) ranged from 48 to 206% over the years. District average yield ranged between 0.20 tonne/ha and 0.43 tonne/ha from 1991-92 to 1999-2000. TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, REFINEMENT AND TRANSFER 179 Under demonstration the yield increased from 1.43 tonnes/ha in 1991-92 to 1.68 tonnes/ha in 1998-99 to 2000-01 over the local check. During the same period the local check increased from 0.49 tonnes/ha to 0.88 tonnes/ha; resulting in decline in the percentage of increase over local check from 190 to 91%. Overall the percentage of increase of local check increased from 15.8% during 1991-92 to 1993-94 to 79.3% during 1998-99 to 2000-01 over the base year of 1991-92. TRAINERS’ TRAINING CENTRES There are eight Trainers’ Training Centres. In these centers, training is imparted through work experience, lectures, field visits, demonstrations and discussions. During the year, 229 training courses were organized benefiting 5,513 participants. During the year, two more TTCs in the areas of vegetables and citrus will be established. MONITORING MECHANISM The Project is monitored through 8 Zonal Co-ordinating Units, located at Ludhiana (Zone I), Calcutta (Zone II), Shillong (Zone III), Kanpur (Zone IV), Hyderabad (Zone V), Jodhpur (Zone VI), Jabalpur (Zone VII) and Bangalore (Zone-VIII). The Zonal Units monitor the frontline extension programmes by organizing Workshop at State level and Zones, Scientific Advisory Committee Meeting and visits. During the year 8 Zonal Workshops were organized with the participation of the Incharges of all the KVKs to review the work done during the year and formulation of action plan for the next year. Similarly, 32 state-level workshops were organized in order Increase in local check due to demonstration conducted on mustard Year No. of Area Average yield (tonnes/ha) % increase in % increase in demonstration (ha) Demonstration Local check yield over yield of local local check check over 1991-92 50 39.2 1.43 0.49 190 - 1991-92 to 1993-94 107 64.2 1..47 0.57 159 15.8 1992-93 to 1994-95 82 350 1.57 0.72 117 46.8 1993-94 to 1994-95 69 30.0 1.60 0.76 109 55.6 1994-95 to 1995-96 68 30.0 1.71 0.76 123 54.1 1995-96 to 1996-97 68 30.0 1.58 0.62 152 27.2 1996-97 to 1997-98 74 30.0 1.60 0.64 148 30.8 1997-98 to 1998-99 75 30.0 1.50 0.74 102 50.9 1998-99 to 2000-01 75 30.0 1.68 0.88 91 79.3 ● TTCs organized 229 training courses, benefiting 5,513 participants.
