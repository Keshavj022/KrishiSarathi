 Plant germplasm registration: The XXXXI meeting of Plant Germplasm Registration Committee was held on 29 September 2020 in virtual mode. Out of 88 proposals received, 78 belonging to 38 species were approved for registration. Some notable registered germplasms were, rice with high zinc in grains, purple leaves and panicles; wheat tolerant to drought stress; barley highly resistant to stripe rust with high 1,000- grain weight (47.5 g) and low protein content (9.5%); first CMS line in radish with higher heterosis for yield, root length and root weight; oil palm with more number of bunches and slow vertical growth; wild diploid potato with wider genetic base highly resistant to late blight disease etc. Plant germplasm registered by PGRC during 2020–21 with current status Crop group XXXXI PGRC Current (29 September 2020) status Cereals and pesudocereals 22 565 Millets 1 83 Fibre and forages 1 120 Grain legumes 8 159 Vegetables 7 91 Commercial crops 4 104 Medical and Aromatic Plants 10 101 and spices Ornamentals 7 69 Oilseeds 15 218 Fruits and nuts – 44 Tubers 3 42 Agro-forestry – 8 Grand total 78 1,604 GENETIC RESOURCES ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 21 Trait-specific germplasm registered during 2020–21 Crop National INGR Novel (unique features) identity number Rice (Oryza sativa) IC0599273 20001 High temperature tolerance IC0635011 20002 Carries xa5, xa13 and Xa21 genes for bacterial blight (BB) resistance IC0627947 20075 Tolerant to salinity stresses up to ECe 10 dS/m with long bold grain IC0635010 20003 High zinc (3,169 ppm) in grains, purple leaves, purple panicles IC0635009 20004 Tetraploid cytotype (2n=4x=48) Wheat (Triticum aestivum) IC0635014 20005 Resistant to stem leaf and stripe rusts.
