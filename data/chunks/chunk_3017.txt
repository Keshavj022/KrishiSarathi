92) were obtained in cabbage hybrid cv. Meenakshi with the application of Ferrous sulfate @ 100 ppm in addition to recommended dose of NPK (180:60:60 kg/ha). Hence, it is recommended for Hyderabad conditions. Insect Pest Management • At Ludhiana, application ofFYM @ 10 t/ha and azotobacter @ 1.25 kg/ha followed by need based NSKE (4%) spray at 10 days interval is recommended for the management of pest complex on brinjal with highest C:B ratio • At Rahuri, application ofNPK @ 100:50:50 along with 4 sprays NSKE (4%) was best in managing brinjal shoot and fruit borer with maximum C:B ratio (1 :4) followed by application of FYM 10 t/ha + Azospirillum @ 1.25 kg/ha along with 4 sprays of NSKE (4%) are recommended for BSFB management with the C:B ratio of 1:1.8. • For effective and economical management of leaf miner in cucumber, erection of yellow sticky trap @ l/hill, clipping oflower 2‐3 infested leaves followed by application of neem soap @ 109/lit or NSKE (4%) at cotyledonary leaf stage and two foliar sprays ofdeltamethrin (0.005%) along withjaggery (2%) at 50% flowering stage is recommended under Anand and Rahuri condition with maximum C:B ratio Disease Management Survey and surveillance 1. Based on 3 years pooled data it has been concluded that average incidence of grey leaf spot (Stemphyllium solani) and early blight (Alternaria solani) in tomato was 66 and 39.7% respectively during November to February; in brinjal Phomopsis blight (Phomopsis vexans) accounted for 36%; with the incidence of 37.4% in powdery mildew (Erysiphe polygonii) in pea. Alternaria brassicae and www.icar.org.in 39 2002‐2007 A.brassicicola with predominance of the later in cauliflower were severe and recommended to take control measures in the region. 2. In tomato, Alternaria blight (A. solani) and buckeye rot (Phytophthora parasitica)were graded serious having varied incidence of 28‐39.4% and 21.6‐29.2%. Fruit rot of capsicum (Phytophthora capsici) was predominantly serious over the years at Solan valley with 18.9‐23.4% incidence. Suitable recommendations should be adopted in the region. Integrated Disease Management 1. Green manuring along with Trichoderma viride @5 kg/ha alone or in combination with neem cake @ 10 q/ha has been found effective in minimizing tomato diseases viz. Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotium rolfsii, Pythium and Phytophthora spp. Upto 50%. The treatment combination of green manuring + neem cake + bioagent was adjudged best in reducing Rhizoctonia/Fusarium root rot/wilt incidence thereby increasing the pea yield considerably and is recommended for Varanasi region. 2. Green manuring + neem cake @10 q/ha + antagonists (Trichoderma viride) 6 kg/ha recorded the minimum Fusarium wilt incidence and increased yield in chilli and okra. The highest C:B ratio 1.03 in chilli and 3.03 in okra was obtained in the treatment. This treatment combination is recommended for effective control of Fusarium wilt in chilli and okra in Rahuri conditions. 3.
