Mushroom cultivation Oyster mushroom may be cultivated in almost all the rice growing areas in Arunachal Pradesh. It may be started immediately after harvesting of paddy crop. The required spawns (Mushroom seeds) may be collected from reliable sources. Proper training is essential for cultivation of this crop. Interested farmers are suggested to contact nearest KVK for cultivation of oyster mushroom Mushroom house is fully clean, dark, ventilated and must be dust free.

Paddy straw are to be chopped into 3-5 cm pieces and soaked in fresh water for 8-16 hours in formalin solution or boil them for at least half an hour. Drain the water completely. It is ready for bagging. 14 x 22-inch PP polybag may be used. 4 to 5 layers of straw may be inserted with some spawn placed on each layer towards the ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 256 sides of the bag. Finally, the bag is be tied tightly and make 30-40 holes with a sterilized knife. Keep the bags in mushroom house hanging one after another. Keep on watering the bags once daily. After 22 days all the bags will turn whitish and in such condition the poly bags need to be removed. Keep on watering twice a day when temperature is above 28oC and when temperature is below 200C spray water once only. Growing mushrooms will be visible from around 28 â€“ 30 days.
