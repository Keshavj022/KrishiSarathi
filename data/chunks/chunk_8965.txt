Hand-operated rotary disc type sheller could not be operated beyond 30 min. due to muscular fatigue involved in the operation. After every 30 min. a rest of 15 min. is must to restart the work. It was also observed that in the traditional method there was a high probability of injury of finger during operation. Strength measurement set-up with both hands (top), in paddle operation in sitting posture (bottom) MEASUREMENT OF STRENGTH PARAMETERS OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS A set-up for measurement of various strength parameters of workers useful for ergonomic design of agricultural equipment and machines has been designed and developed by Bhopal Centre of All-India Co-ordinated Research Project on Human Engineering and Safety in Agriculture. The strength parameters which can be measured by the set-up are push and pull forces by one or both the hands in sitting and standing posture, leg and foot strength of right and left leg in sitting posture, steering force which a tractor operator can apply on a steering wheel with one or both hands in clock-wise or anti clock-wise direction and cranking force with one or both the hands during push or pull mode in standing posture. For accurate and reliable measurement of strength parameters, the set-up uses a straingauge type load cell with indicator which could be mounted with appropriate fixtures provided for the purpose. The indicator also has a provision for analogue output for recording of the data with a suitable recorder. The set- up is portable and can be dismantled into different components for easy transport from place to place. AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY 135 PROTOTYPE FEASIBILITY TESTING Tractor-mounted Rotavator The JNKVV, Jabalpur and PDKV, Akola Centres of AICRP on FIM carried out feasibility testing of tractor-mounted rotavator of 1,250 mm size. Testing of the rotavator was carried out for preparation of puddle bed for rice in 11 ha and seedbed for wheat in 24 ha at JNKVV, Jabalpur and 61 ha at PDKV, Akola for cotton crop. Use of rotavator reduced the number of operations, thereby increasing the overall field capacity and reducing the time required for seedbed preparation. The seedbed quality obtained was better than that with conventional practices and the rice stubbles were also incorporated in the soil. Tractor-mounted Potato Planter A tractor-mounted potato planter was field evaluated at AADU, Allahabad Centre of AICRP on FIM, at recommended seed rate (2.5 tonnes/ha). At row spacing of 560 mm and average seed-to-seed spacing of 127 mm the machine was tested for forward speed of 1.29 to 1.65 km/hr. The field capacity varied from 0.08 to 0.14 ha/ hr with corresponding field efficiency varying from 55% to 73%. The plant population/m row and yield varied from 0.8 to 1.0 and 29.5 to 31.
