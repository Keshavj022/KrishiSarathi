 Monthly composites of NDVI for growing season of wheat from December to March for a period of 19 years (2001-02 to 2019-20) were prepared in Arc Map. 2.2.3. Land Surface Temperature (LST) data Land surface temperature data of MODIS Terra 8-day product: MOD11A2 collection v006 was obtained from LPDAAC for the growing season of wheat from 2001-02 to 2019-20. Monthly composites of LST for growing season of wheat were prepared after the quality check in Arc Map, and were then translated from a digital number (DN) to degree Celsius (◦C) by using Eq. (1). LST(℃) = 0.02 × DN −273.15 (1) where 0.02 represents the scale factor and DN represent the digital number of the pixel. 2.2.4. Other data Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) data from MOD17A2HGF, v006 acquired from the LPDAAC, website and groundwater level data ob­ tained from the online archives of India Water Portal from 2001 to 2020, were also used to understand the impact of droughts on them. The groundwater locations taken into consideration were between 571 and 722 from 2001 to 2020, as some borewells become dysfunctional due to declining groundwater level or for some other reasons and on the other hand some new borewells are drilled from time to time. 2.2.5. Data quality and integrity Data quality flags provided by LPDAAC were used for the quality analysis of GPP using MODIS-VIIRS python toolbox and Arc Map soft­ ware. To assess the validity of GPP, wheat yield predicted from the GPP was compared with actual economic wheat yield obtained from the statistical abstracts of Punjab and Haryana. Further, both the yields were year wise correlated with each other, and the results indicated moderate to strong positive correlation in each ACZ. Due to linear positive cor­ relation between GPP derive wheat yield and economic wheat yield, GPP was used for the correlation analysis with NVSWI also. Bandyo­ padhyay et al. (2018), studied the accuracy of gridded data from IMD (0.25 × 0.25) with the precipitation data taken from the in-situ obser­ vatories over India, and found its performance satisfactory (coefficient of determination (R2) values between 0.6 and 0.8 and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) value greater than 0.5 in Punjab and Haryana area). 2.3. Computation of drought indices 2.3.1. Rainfall data time series and computation of SPI Gridded rainfall data (of over 30 years) was converted into point data in Arc Map and monthly time series was prepared from the year 1986–2020. Area wise monthly rainfall was averaged for ACZ- I, II and III, to compute the SPI. R package "SPEI" (CRAN repository) was used to calculate SPI on one (1), there (3), six (6), and twelve (12) month scales for evaluating meteorological drought in this work. The index is based on converting aggregated monthly precipitation into a standard normal variable via an equi-probability transformation. In fact, calculating the index entails fitting a probability distribution to aggregated monthly precipitation series (e.g.
