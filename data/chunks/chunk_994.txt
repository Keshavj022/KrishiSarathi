 This is the opportune time for special issue in view of International Year of Millets being observed in 2023 across the globe. Millets, termed as ‘nutri-cereals’ enjoy the indispensable place in Indian dietary system, since time immemorial. Post-Green Revolution, the acreage of millets decreased due to area expansion under irrigation and consequent area shift towards wheat, rice and maize. It is imperative to create awareness among the masses and farmers about the nutritional, health and environmental value of millets. This special issue provides precise knowledge, scientific facts, and technology on millets. The key achievements made by ICAR’s institutes in these nutri-cereals have been documented. However, the millets were grown in sizeable area due to their resilience in against climatic stresses and withstand under water stressed conditions. I hope that the information provided through this special issue, shall be of immense use to farming community and serve as our magnum opus on millets covering their important aspects for benefit of the masses. I wish to congratulate all authors and the team of editors involved in this publication and a great success to International Year of Millets, 2023.

The Millet crops, traditionally grown in resource poor agro-climatic conditions, are gaining importance because of high level of nutritional and health benefits as compared to wheat, rice and maize. The millet grains so called nutricereals, are best alternative to address the nutritional deficiency such as protein, iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc prevalent among population. It is matter of great pride for all of us that India is taking lead in observance of International Year of Millets 2023. Awareness is to be extended amongst masses for the benefits of millets.
