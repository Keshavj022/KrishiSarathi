The rates of B application for achieving optimum yield varied with crops, season, type of soil. Mustard, maize, sunflower, onion and lentil gave optimum yields at 1.5 kg/ha. of B application and that of kharif (summer) crops groundnut, maize, onion, yam bean and blackgram gave the best yield at 2.0‐2.5 kg B/ha. Application of 2.5 kg B/ha causes reduction in yield due to boron injury Screening crop cultivars to tolerance of manganese deficiency • Deficiency of manganese in wheat is rapidly spreading in coarse textured alkaline soil having low organic matter content. Soil application of 20‐50 kg Mn/ha is the optimum, but is highly uneconomical as compared to 2‐3 foliar sprays of 0.5‐1.0% manganese sulphate solution at weekly interval.. The response of wheat and other crops to foliar sprays ranges from 200‐ 3000 kg/ha over NPK. Most often manganese application decided entire failure or success of crop production in about 1.5 lakh hectares area Data in Table 6.3 showed that tolerant cultivars need less number of foliar sprays of manganese as compared to susceptible cultivars of wheat..

Studies showed that Zn and S fertilization significantly influence the yield quality of produce menthol. The highest content of menthol but the lowest level of menthane and menthyl acetate was recorded under the treatment combination of 10 kg Zn+ 20 kg S ha‐1. The response of green gram to multi micronutrient application indicated that the highest grain yield of mustard (1357 kg ha‐1) was recorded by use of 5 kg Zn + 40 kg S ha‐1 in mollisol. Efficacy of Multi Micronutrient Mixture in Improving Crop Production • Multi micronutrient mixture grades for foliar and soil application were prepared in the laboratory equivalent to Govt. recognized grades for their testing in important crops under different agro‐climatic situation of the Gujarat.
