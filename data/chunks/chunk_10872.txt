 Maize   Deep summer plough to destroy pests and conserve moisture   Sow medium duration varieties/hybrids DHM-117, DHM-119 DHM-121, Bisco-855, Bio- 9637, Bisco-740, Kaveri Ekka-2288, Kaveri -2020, Kaveri-3696 and short duration hybrids DHM-115, Pioneer-3342, KH-5991, DKC-7074 during 15th June to 15th July. Sowing can be extended up to July end if monsoon is delayed.   Sow on receipt of at-least 50-60 mm rainfall for better germination and complete sowing in a week for reducing the incidence of FAW   Spray NSKE 5% or neem oil 1500 ppm @5ml/l after sowing and at weekly intervals   Dibble seeds with tractor drawn cultivator or seed cum ferti drill on ridges and beds   Intercrop red gram varieties PRG-176, WRG-97 in 2:1 ratio in light soils and in 4:1 ratio in heavy soils to reduce incidence of FAW ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 153   Follow IPM for FAW management: summer ploughing, growing single cross hybrids, clean cultivation, intercropping with pulses, balanced fertilization, release of egg parasitoids (Trichogramma sp) and spraying Chlorantraniliprole @ 0.4 ml or spinetoram @ 0.5 ml or Emamectin benzoate @ 0.4 g per litre in plant whorls. Pigeon pea   Sow high yielding varieties WRG-65, PRG-176, PRG-158, ICP-8863, ICPL-87119, WRG-27, WRG-53, LRG-41 during 15th June to 15th July at a spacing of 150-180 x 20 cm in black soils and 90-120 x 20 cm in red soils   Treat seeds with thiram or captan @3g/kg followed by rhizobium culture @200-400 g/ kg   In case of rainfed red soils, redgram should be taken instead of cotton for realizing better   Soil application of 25 kg ZnSO4/ha is recommended for red gram under irrigated conditions.   Intercropping in Red gram + Cotton (1:4/ 1:6), Soybean (1:4/ 1:6), Green gram/ Black gram (1:7) should be followed   Treat the Red gram seed with Trichoderma viride @ 10 g/ kg seed to protect the crop from soil borne diseases.   Spray pendimethalin @ 1 - 1.5 lit in 200 liters of water within 24 – 48 hours after sowing will be effective in controlling the weeds in Red gram.   Post emergence application of quizalofop ethyl @ 400 ml/ acre for control of grasses and imazethapyr 10 % @ 250 ml to control both grasses and broad leaved weeds.   If there is submergence due to excess rain, drain excess water at the earliest and spray 1% KNO3 or 19:19:19, 20:20:20 or 21:21:21   Collect and destroy blister beetles in morning times   Practice nipping wherein terminal branches are removed so as to facilitate lateral branches thus improving yields.   Take need based plant protection measures against pod borer complex from bud initiation to pod development stage. Groundnut   Seed rate recommended is 200 kg/ha and practice seed treatment with imidacloprid 600 FS @ 2 ml/kg followed by tebuconazole 2 DS @ 1g or mancozeb @ 3 g/kg or Trichoderma viride @ 10g/kg to control sucking pests , collar rot, PSND in the early stages.
