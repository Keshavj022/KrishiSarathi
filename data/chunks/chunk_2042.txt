 Data management The sensor embedded with the IoT system captures DO level and temperature of the nearby water area preferably in 10-minute interval. The huge continuous data are transferred and stored in the cloud system. The data can be viewed from any location via developed web Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report -Outcomes/ results of use case Automated DO management system will help to take automated decision that will immediately respond to improve the environment by controlling DO level in the waterbody and hence will prevent further deterioration of ambient water condition. It also generates real-time water parameter status report in the cloud-based application for monitoring purpose which is accessed via internet from any desktop or mobile (Table 2). The temporal variation of the DO level of the pond system is plotted in Fig 2.

Architectural considerations a. Data management The sensor embedded with the loT system captures DO level and temperature of the nearby water area preferably in 10-minute interval. The huge continuous data are transferred and stored in the cloud system. The data can be viewed from any location via developed web TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 109 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 110 interface and downloaded in excel format for any further research. Web-interface was developed using ThingSpeak IoT analytic platform service. b . System architecture The architecture of the DO system is described in the Fig. 3. The system is made up of a microcontroller, an internet connectivity source for connecting to the internet and it attached with a DO sensor which is installed in the waterbody. The devise is capable of detecting the DO sensor and convert it into digital form. The converted DO reading is transmitted over the internet and store in the cloud space. A web interface was developed using ThingSpeak IoT analytic platform service to display the real time DO reading of the waterbody with an interval of 10 minute. The date wise DO status of the waterbody can be downloaded in Excel format. Farm owner/end user can access the real-time DO level and temperature of the waterbody via internet from any location.
