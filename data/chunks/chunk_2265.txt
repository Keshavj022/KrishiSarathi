 This model enables small and marginal farmers to achieve bargaining power and economics of scale by strengthening backward and forward integration along the supply chain, lowering costs, and improving efficiency by synchronizing and harmonizing selected key operations (such as: land preparation, planting, and harvest). Fig. 17. Mini Tubers Production using Apical Rooted Cuttings Technology Facility ICAR-CGIAR | ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 55 CIP piloted the SFLF model in 12 locations of Odisha (Fig. 19) and in 3 locations of Assam (Fig. 20). Through this model CIP has demonstrated the benefit of collective efforts in farming operations (Table 7). While the model emphasizes on bringing the small and marginal farmers together, at the same time it opens doors for better availability of inputs (seed, machines, fertilizer and other chemicals) through backward linkage to input suppliers. The potatoes framers from Odisha and Assam, participating in this model shared that for the first time they saw, learned and practiced mechanization for the potato crop â€“ the initiative introduced mechanized potato planters and diggers in all the pilot locations. The initiative got overwhelmed response from farmers in both the states. Farmers participating in this farming model, have claimed that their productivity has doubled, and profit has increased three to four times. Fig. 18.
