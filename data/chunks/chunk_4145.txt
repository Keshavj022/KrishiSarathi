After preparing the sunken beds, the beds were filled with sand and cocopeat. The lower 6 inches (15 cm) of the bed were filled with sand while the upper 6 inches (15 cm) were filled with cocopeat. The purpose of digging out soil from the beds is to fill it with sand and cocopeat to make soilless beds conducive for planting the cuttings, and to avoid weeds and reduce the water requirement considerably. The cuttings of 30 cm size of pencil thickness (8-10 mm) with 8-9 buds were selected and planted in the first week of March in these beds. The lower portion of the cuttings was given a horizontal cut and light cut on either side of the cutting at the base to expose more of the cambium for callusing. Before planting, the cuttings were given fungicidal treatment (Carbendazim 3 g/litre of water) for 20-25 seconds and dipped in rooting hormone Indole Butyric Acid IBA (2500 ppm) for 10-15 seconds. The cuttings were planted in the soilless beds at a spacing of 3 inches (7.62 cm) both in a row-to- row and cutting-to-cutting to accommodate 52 cuttings per sq. meter area. With this technology, 40-45 plants with well- developed root systems were harvested per square meter area of the soilless beds. This technology will revolutionize the production of clonal rootstocks in the country from the wasted portion of the plant. By adopting this technology, the cost of rootstock/planting material will get reduced and dependence on import for quality planting material will decline drastically.

Waste generated in 423 Class-I cities works out to 72.5% of the total waste generated each day and this needs to be tackled on priority. Research R A Ram* M unicipal solid waste comprises 30 to 55% of bio- degradable (organic) matter, 40 to 55% inert matter and 5 to 15% recyclables. Composition of waste varies with size of city, season and income group. Per capita waste generation varies between 0.2 to 0.6 kg per day in cities with population ranging from 1.0 to 50 lakhs. An assessment has been made that because of increasing per capita waste generation of about 1.
