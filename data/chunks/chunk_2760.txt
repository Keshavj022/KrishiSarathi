 Your table indicates that in T3 generation, 917 plants belonging to T-1-8-l0 were advanced further. Does it mean that progeny of T-l-ll, on which Southerns were done, had not been advanced further? Tl-ll is nothing but Tl-8-10 5. You had indicated that in 2009, you had found that T8 standing crop contained only MONS3l. What was the month of testing? I presume that this crop grown during the 2009-10 season. August- November, 2009 6. You had indicated that plants containing cryIAc and 5"3 not containing MONS31 were identified in January 2010. Does this mean that old seeds (6200 in number) of multi- copy Bt containing TS generation were grown in the 2009- 10 season? What was the reason to grow them during 2009- 10 growing season? Old seed was sown ~n January, 2010 ~n green house fur screening only 7. When did you first come to know that BnBt had been contaminated with MONS31? August 2009 Yours sincerely Katageri Dr.IS. Katageri, Principal Scientist (Cotton), Agriculture Research Station, Dharwad farm., Dhanuad-580007 INDIA. kfobile:+919448822266 ~Jice:0836-2741092 - - Request for infonnation to be made available during visit of sub-committee to NRCPB on 24th March 2012 • The details of the gene construct and plasmid vector provided by Dr. Ananda Kumar to UAS, Dharwad is to be provided. This information should include the sequence of the vector and it's restriction map. • Was this vector and gene construct developed at NRCPB? If not, what is the source of this vector? Was this vector obtained via an MTA? Is a copy of the MTA available? • Is-there a single Hindlll site within the T-DNA of the binary vector provided by Dr. Ananda Kumar? Is Southern analysis with Hindlll digested genomic DNA expected to reveal a junction fragment of BnBt (BNLA106 event)? • The Southern blots presented in Kategeri et al 2007 (Current Science) and the recently conducted Southern blots on purified Bn-Bt· are be presented to the committee. Would original lab records from the earlier analysis and the recent analysis be available? Are the old DNA samples still available? • How was the sequence of the flanking DNA and vector DNA sequence at the integration site established with the purified BnBt event? Was this outsourced or done 'in-house'? The details of this recent work need to be provided? How is this different from the earlier work done by Avasthagen? • The newly obtained sequence of the BnBt event that shows the flanking DNA and vector DNA sequence at the integration site is to be made available. Can a 7 kb Hindlll fragment, that encompasses the Cry 1Ac gene in the event, be predicted by analysis of this sequence? • Have the newly developed "event specific primers" been used with old genomic DNA from the 2007 work (if that DNA sample is available)? • How as the "purification" of Bn-Bt carried out.
