 Dry chilies were used in storage as protection against pests. In the initial evaluation the samples of greengram seeds, three each from 10 practitioners, were taken from the Benakunda village. These samples were drawn during August 2001 within 2 months of putting the seeds for storage and were Table 4. Status of seeds stored in gunny bags under different treatments at farmer’s level just before sowing Treatment Moisture (%) Purity (%) Germination (%) Infected seeds (%) Mixed with dry chillies (ITK), 10.49 99.60 66.00 4.72 Treated with chemical 10.27 99.56 73.60 7.50 (aluminum 4 phosphide powder) Smeared with mustard oil, n = 1 9.80 99.64 90.00 4.00 No treatment (control), n = 3 10.88 99.54 55.00 5.33 subjected to initial physical purity and germination studies. Physical purity was found to vary from 25% to 99% and g ermination from 20% to 98% (Table 4) at the level of different practitioners. This clearly indicated the variation in the processing of seed at the farmer’s level. In order to study the effect of chilli along with other methods of ITK being practiced in the village, 20 samples were collected randomly almost just before sowing in January. The seeds were stored in August and kept for about 6 months in gunny bags. The quality testing was done by State Seed Testing Laboratory, Bhubaneshwar. GRAIN/SEED STORAGE The seeds treated with mustard oil (Table 5) were found to be the best in respect of moisture (9.8%), purity (99.8%), germination (90.0%) and seed health (4.0%). The disclosed ITK, i.e. mixed with dry chillies, stood second best with respect to purity (99.60%) and seed health (4.72%) and third in moisture (10.49%) and germination (66.00%). Seeds without any treatment showed lowest germination (55.00) and highest moisture content. Fusarium spp. was the dominant fungus which affected (from 3_15%) almost all the seed samples. Rhizophus, Alternaria, Penicillium and Sclerotium were among the other fungus species reported in the samples. CONCLUSION Use of dry chillies in storing pulses has been found in practice in Benakunda village. The farmers also use alternative methods like use of chemicals (aluminum phosphide) mustard oil, neem leaves and begunia leaves. Use of gunny bag in storing seeds is more popular than metal or tin containers. Sand layering either at the bottom or top was not in practice, instead sealing of the containers with lid of straw and mud plastering was reported. Treatments of dry chillies and mustard oil helped store the seeds fairly effectively.  GRAIN/SEED STORAGE Code : 1465 Title of the ITK : To protect cereals and pulses during storage through use of fingermillet heads Description of the ITK : The ragi (fingermillet) cobs have some smell and produce some chemical which helps in keeping away insect pests from stored grains. The mature cobs of ragi are put inside the grain stores along with rice, wheat and pulses during storage.
