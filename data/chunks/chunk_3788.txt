 I am shouldering the responsibility as Chairman Project Steering Committee (PSC) relating to R&D under Central Sector Scheme for conservation, development and sustainable management of medicinal plants of central sector scheme of funding research projects under NMPB (Ministry of AYUSH) in various aspects of medicinal plants for the last six years and I have found that a good number of effective research projects have been submitted on at least twenty important medicinal plants. The time is ripe for Indian farmers to harness the power of medicinal and aromatic plants and chart a path towards a more sustainable and prosperous future. ICAR-DMAPR, Anand and ICAR-AICRP on MAP and Betelvine have embraced all these challenges and developed a number of varieties and technologies for the farmers and still working towards the development of technologies and varieties for sustainable development of MAPs. Jai Hind (Dr Suresh K Malhotra) Septemberâ€“October 2023 3 Message Medicinal & Aromatic Plants - Key for health M EDICINAL and aromatic plants (MAPs) have played a crucial role in human healthcare for centuries, offering diverse remedies ranging from herbal teas to pharmaceutical compounds. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 80% of the global population still relies on traditional plant-based medicine for primary healthcare needs. The cultivation of medicinal plants has advanced over time, transitioning from small backyard gardens to large commercial plantations. This progression stems from agricultural technology advancements, rising demand for plant-based medicines, and the imperative to safeguard endangered medicinal plant species. Cultivating medicinal plants entails a complex interplay of factors such as selecting suitable plant species, optimizing growing conditions, and managing pests and diseases. Medicinal plants and their by-products constitute an important part of the foreign trade showing continuous growth in export over import and thus, signify their importance outside the boundaries of the territory. The estimated global herbal industry is valued over US$ 60 billion mainly in the form of pharmaceuticals (US$ 40 billion), spices and herbs (US$ 5.9 billion), natural cosmetics (US$ 7 billion) and essential oil (US$ 4 billion). It is growing at the pace of 7% per year and is expected to reach US$ 5 trillion by the year 2050. India is emerging as a major player in the global trade of plant based medicines. However, this requires a good strategic plan, taking a holistic view of the entire situation to boost the export and minimize the import. Increasing demand for MAPs has raised concerns about the conservation of their genetic diversity, habitat loss, quality in terms of clean (free from physical and chemical contaminants/adulterants), consistent (dependable production and bioactivity levels), and certified (identifiable for origin and history) products.
