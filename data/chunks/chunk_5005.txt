 The number of armyworm larvae and the plant infestation rate showed similar declining pattern. Fig. 3. Efficacy of different insecticidal spray against number of infested plants per plot  PEST AND DISEASE MANGEMENT On fiftieth day after spray The decrease in number of aphids and armyworm larvae took place in all the plots with a marginal difference in CU + VN and CU + FA treatments. The total eradication of wheat aphids and larvae of armyworm took place in plots treated with monocrotophos and CU + VN + FA. These results show that the combination of CU + VN + FA as bio-pesticide was significantly more effective in controlling the infestation of wheat aphid as compared to other biopesticide treatments. Statistically all the treatments are at par. Though quantitatively the CU+VN was least effective, followed by CU, CU + FA, the remaining two, i.e. CU + VN + FA and MC were significantly most effective in reducing effective treatment in controlling the aphids fully except on 20th day. The CU + VN + FA controlled the insect pest completely only after 40th day. Other treatments did not fully control the pests, though they reduced the aphid population significantly as compared to control. Combined treatments was more effective than sole treatments, and the best combined treatments was CU + VN + FA. The population of armyworm larvae showed an increase till 20th day, after which it declined. All the treatments were effective after 1st day. All the treatments except CU alone, including MC were almost equally effective in controlling the larvae of armyworm. The results revealed that toxicity in terms of different insecticide formulation was maximum A B Fig. 4. Wheat plants affected with aphid (a) and armyworm (b) Fig. 5. Armyworm larvae infesting wheat crop on day 40; wheat crop on day 40 after spray and the crop at maturity population of aphids. Regarding the comparative efficacy of different treatments, statistically they were at par, though CU + VN + FA was the best, followed by CU + FA and CU + VN for aphid control. Similar was the case with larvae of armyworm, but CU + VN + FA was followed by CU + VN, CU + FA and CU respectively. Regarding infested plant/ plot, CU + VN + FA and MC treatments showed significantly less infested plants as compared to control. The other treatments did not give significant results and the results remained consistent in different days of observations. Statistically it is revealed that MC was the most PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT with CU + VN + FA in comparison with CU+VN and CU+FA, suggesting that addition of nirgandi (Vitex negundo) and hing (Ferula asafotida) to cow urine acts as a catalyst. These results also indicate that cow urine with addition to above mentioned herbs is a slow-acting insecticide in comparison to chemical method of insect control with monocrotophos.
