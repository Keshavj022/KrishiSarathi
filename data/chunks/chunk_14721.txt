 Quanti­ ty/Intensity plot represents the relation between changes in the amount of soil labile K (quantity factor) and the activity ratio (ARe K) (intensity factor). A typical Q/I isotherm plot has been presented in the Fig. 1. Each Q/I isotherm plot is marked by a curvilinear line which can be resolved into two parts. One is the straight line and the other is the curved part of the line. The linear relationship is observed at the high activity ratios and as the activity ratio declines the straight-line trans­ forms to curved one. Beckett (1964b) showed that the linear portion of the plot represents ion exchange on the planar surface of the clay, whereas the curved portion of the plot represents K release from the specific sites, i.e. from edges and the interlayer positions with high af­ finity (Beckett and Nafady, 1967). Quantity intensity relationship is basically a permanent character of a soil (Schindler et al., 2005) and any alteration in the Q/I parameters owing to changes in management practices may be considered an important topic of research. Quantity intensity relationship of K was determined following the method of Beckett (1964). 2.5 g of soil was taken in a 50 mL poly­ propylene centrifuge bottle and 25 mL of 10 mmol L−1 of CaCl2 was added having 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mmol L−1 K. The soil samples containing incremental doses of K in 0.01 M CaCl2 back­ ground was shaken for 2 h at 150 rpm. The tubes were left for 24 h for attaining equilibrium. Thereafter, the samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was collected after filtration through Whatman No.1 filter paper. Potassium content was analyzed in the supernatant by flame photometer and Ca++ and Mg++ by Versenate titration method (Black et al., 1965). The quantity of K+ gained or lost ( ± ΔK) by the soil (quantity factor) was calculated as follows: ΔK ( mg kg−1) = (CKi −CKf)v w (1) Where, ΔK is expressed in mg kg−1; CKi and CKf are expressed in mg L−1; Fig. 1. Typical Quantity intensity curve. K. Rani et al. Soil & Tillage Research 228 (2023) 105644 4 v is the volume of CaCl2 solution added and w is the mass (g) of the soil taken. ΔK is expressed in cmol(p + )kg−1 as per the Eq. (2). ΔK(cmol(p+)kg−1 = ΔK(mg kg−1) 390 (2) The intensity factor or activity ratio (ARe K) of K was determined relative to Ca++ and Mg++ species for each equilibrium concentration using the formula: ARe K = aK ( aCa+Mg )1/2 = CK (CCa+Mg)1/2 × fK (fCa+Mg)1/2 (3) Where, ARe K= activity ratio of K+ to Ca++ + Mg++ after equilibration (mol L−1) ½; aK= activity of K+ (mol L−1); aCa+Mg= activity of Ca++ + Mg++ (mol L−1); fK= activity coefficient of K+;fCa+Mg= activity coefficient of Ca++ + Mg++; CK (CCa+Mg)1/2= Concentration ratio (CRe K); CK = concentration of K (mol L−1) and CCa+Mg= concentration of K (mol L−1).
