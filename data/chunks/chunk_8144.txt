 Drainage-cum-recharge well was designed and evaluated for rainwater, runoff water and greywater (wastewater) under north Bihar conditions by Pusa centre of AICRP on Irrigation Water Management. The filter combination, i.e. coloured gravel + sand + charcoal showed highest recharge rate of 2.6 litres/s and 79.3% reduction in turbidity. Nutrient management Mapping current status of Zn and B deficiency: Status of Zn and B deficiency in Indian soils were assessed and mapped based on nearly 2.04 lakh geo- referenced soil samples across the country covering 58 agro-ecological sub regions (AESRs). Zn deficiency status in soils of AESRs 1.2, 6.4, 14.1, 14.2 and 16.2 was recorded as less than 10% while soils of AESRs 7.3, 12.3, 14.2, 14.4, 15.1, 15.3, 16.3, 17.1, 18.3 and 19.1 were having 10–20% deficiency. The soils of these regions are mostly acidic in nature containing high organic carbon content. The highest (> 50% soils) Zn deficiency was reported in soils of middle (AESRs 4.4, 10.1, 10.2 and 10.4), western (AESRs 2.1 and 2.2) and southern (AESRs 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 18.1) parts of India. In general, the other AESRs falling in western India (AESRs 2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3) were having acute Zn deficiency as compared to north east, east and extreme northern parts of India. The soils of AESRs 4.1, 4.2, 7.1, 9.1, 11, 12.1, 12.2, 14.5, 18.4 and 19.2, were having 20–30% Zn deficiency. Filter to recharge groundwater through borewells (Rahuri) Composite filter in operation (Ludhiana) Filter assembly of drainage-cum- recharge structure (Pusa) SOIL AND WATER PRODUCTIVITY DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2018–19 14 In contrast to Zn, B deficiency occurs predominantly in eastern (AESRs 12.1, 12.2, 12.3 and 15.1), north east (AESRs 15.2 and 16.3), extreme north (AESRs 14.1 and 14.3) and south western (AESRs 6.1, 8.2 and 8.4) parts of the country where soils are acidic in nature. Boron deficiency of less than 10% soils were reported in central (AESRs 4.4, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4), western (AESRs 2.1 and 2.2) and south eastern (AESRs 7.3, 18.2 and 18.3) parts of India. The soils of AESRs 1.2, 7.2, 9.2, 11, 13.1, 19.2 and 19.3 had B deficiency in the range of 20–30%. The digitized maps of micronutrients status developed for different AESRs would be helpful in providing site-specific variable rate application of micronutrients prescription for sustainable agricultural productivity. Synthesis of new potassic organo mineral fertilizer: Presently, requirement of potassic fertilizers are fully met out through import with a foreign exchange burden of about ` 20,000 cr/annum. India has huge deposits (87.12 million tonnes) of low grade potash bearing feldspar mineral in Rajasthan. Accordingly, a new method was developed to convert this mineral into organo-mineral fertilizer (OMF) by mixing it with chemically treated leonardite which is an oxidized form of lignite and found abundantly in the country (estimated reserves 2.05 billion tonnes).
