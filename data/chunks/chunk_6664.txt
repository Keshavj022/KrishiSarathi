 Genomic diversity was estimated in Arunachali yak population based on data generated using ddRAD sequencing. Three indices,viz. nucleotide diversity (0.041 in 200 bp windows), effective population size (Ne = 83) and runs of homozygosity (>90% were short and medium length) revealed that the genomic diversity in Arunachali yak breed as of now is optimum. Fish Improvement: Successful natural spawning of green snapper, Lethrinus nebulosus was achieved icar annual report 2022-23 4 in recirculatory aquaculture system (RAS). It is a large tropical marine fish species that grows to 80 cm in length and 8.4 kg in weight. Lethrinus nebulosus were collected from wild and developed into functional broodstock in 10 t RAS system. Simple non- invasive breeding and culture protocols have been developed for four indigenous ornamental fishes of the Western Ghat, viz. Pethia setnai, Pethia nigripinnis, Dawkinsia tambraparniei and Dawkinsia arulius. Similarly, breeding technique were standardized for two endangered species of genus Dawkinsia, viz. Dawkinsia tambraparniei, the Tambraparniei barb and Dawkinsia arulius, the Arulius barb. Two backyard recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) models of rearing tanks size 3 and 7 cubic metrewith production capacity of 30 kg per m3 were designed, fabricated and validated for small- scale farming of rainbow trout by the farmers of hill states to reduce the initial cost of investment. Genetic Resources: Total 890 accessions (450 cultivated and 440 wild) including unique landraces of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables and germplasms of wild edible fruits and wild relatives of the cultivated crops collected through 18 explorations. Under National Gene bank 5,152 accessions of orthodox seed species added for long-term storage resulting into the total of 4,62,923 accessions in its present base collection. In Cryogene bank, 404 accessions of seeds and pollen genomic resources of different crop species were cryopreserved, making the total collection of 12,480 accessions. Total of 41,557 accessions were imported from 37 countries and 14,641 entries from trails/nurseries from CG centres. Imported samples numbering 133,673 were processed for quarantine clearance. One plant quarantine database and two web-based applications were developed. ICAR-NBAIM, the nodal agency for developing DNA fingerprints of microbial cultures to be registered as biopesticides developed fingerprints of more than 487 samples for accurate identity. A total of 26 microbes were accessioned under safe deposition and 72 cultures were sold to academia and companies fetching 2,91,600 revenue to the institute. In horticulture, a total of 3,346 accessions were collected and 26 accessions showing unique traits have been registered as novel genetic stock. Five genotypes of longan of fruit size (8.1 – 8.5g/fruit), an oilpalm cross progeny number 483 (599NATP × 33D) promising for more oil to bunch ratio (21.37%) and 175 fungal mushroom accessions identified.
