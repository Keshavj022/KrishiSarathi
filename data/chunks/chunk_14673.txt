 However, the excessive application of nitrogen reduces crop yield and adversely affects crop quality. Phosphorus promotes seed germination and viability, increases plant root length, and promotes flowering [38]. It also stimulates plant cell division and enlarges cell tissue [81]. As a result, the initial growth of phosphorus-deficient plants is gradual [62], and their overall growth is with fewer leaves [77]. Table 6.

Banana Peel Biochar Biochar is a fine, carbon-rich, organic material synthesized through the pyrolysis of biomass [96]. In pyrolysis, biomass decomposes at temperatures greater than 400 ◦C in limited or in the absence of oxygen. A mixture of gas (syngas), liquid (bio-oil), and solid (biochar) products are formed [97]. To favour biochar formation, biomass is normally pyrolyzed slowly, at a heating rate of 5–20 ◦C per minute and with higher residence times [98–100]. The properties of biochar are directly impacted by its pyrolysis conditions, such as the type of feedstock material (size and shape) used, temperature, reactor shape and type, heating rate, residence time, and chemical activation [101]. These also affect its applications. Table 7 presents the synthesis conditions of BP biochar from the different studies reviewed in this work. Long residence times, high catalyst masses, and low temperatures were found to give better yields. Generally, biochar exhibits high biodegradability, high contents of total carbon and organic carbon, and optimal concentrations of micro- and macro elements (potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, copper, zinc, iron, etc.). Properties such as these have given it applications related to the various fields of agriculture, and specifically to soil health. Biochar from wheat has been reported to increase soil permeability by 35.4–49.5%, decrease bulk density by 5.5–11.6% in clay loamy soil using saline irrigation water, and further increase the yield of wheat grain [102]. Due to its porous nature, it is efficacious at retaining water and water-soluble nutrients [102]. It can effectively reduce soil emissions of CO2 emanating from the excessive usage of chemical fertilizers [103–105]. Several studies Agriculture 2024, 14, 1894 15 of 24 reported an improvement in soil microbial activity [106] and soil properties such as pore size distribution, soil organic carbon [107], pH [108], soil structure [109], and cation exchange capacity (CEC) [110] upon its application.
