 In this meeting, the seven strategic areas were finalized as (i) Biotechnology, genomics and allele mining in plants, animals and fisheries; (ii) Abiotic and biotic stresses and, quality traits in plants, animals and fisheries; (iii) Precision agriculture and management of natural resources and application of sensors in crops, animals and Fisheries; (iv) Nanotechnology in agriculture, (v) Metabolomics in agriculture; (vi) Farm Mechanization and energy and (vii) Social Sciences and policy in agriculture. Monitoring of ongoing projects: The on-going projects are being monitored at three levels, i.e. the projects are being reviewed by the ‘Expert Committees’ and the ‘Empowered Committee. Besides, to mentor, monitor and review the projects each project also has an ‘Advisory Committee’. Six Annual Review meetings were held in the months from December, 2019 to February, 2020 and August, 2020 to review the 59 ongoing projects. More than 10 advisory committee meetings were held during 2019–20 to mentor, monitor and evaluate the projects. Besides, the Empowered Committee also reviewed the progress of three mega projects, viz. ‘Genetic improvement of rice for yield, NUE, WUE, abiotic and biotic stress tolerance through RNA Guided Genome Editing (CRISPR-Cas9/Cpf1)’, ‘Development of sustainable management tools for the invasive pest, Fall Armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) in maize’ and ‘Production of multiple copies of elite buffalo bulls using animal cloning technology in September, 2020. In addition to the results in terms of high impact publications, patents and technologies, a strong and sustainable platform for developing scientific capacity and culture that encompasses the extended NARS is being established. This will ensure continuous flow of knowledge, ideas and working together among different stakeholders in the basic, strategic and frontier application research for solving problems in agriculture and also forming science policy in agriculture. Salient achievements During 2019–20, besides having more than 70 research publications in reputed journal, NASF had seven patents and 10 technologies. The research highlights of some selected projects are as follows: Phenomics of water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency in rice: RIL population (170) of ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 174 SUPPORTING BASIC AND STRATEGIC RESEARCH ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 175 BVD109 (drought tolerant) × IR 20 (drought susceptible) was phenotyped for diurnal and nocturnal water use towards identification of donors for component traits of water use. RILs C-822-103, C- 822-105, C-822-123, C-822-130, C-822-99, C-822- 124 and C-822-129 showed high transpiration efficiency as compared with both the parents BVD109 and IR20. The parents and RIL population were genotyped with 50 K SNP chip for QTL mapping. QTLs for nocturnal and diurnal transpiration and WUE were mapped.
