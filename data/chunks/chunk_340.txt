However, the grain production could be sustained initially due to enhanced yield levels resulting from development of high-yielding cultivars. A number of high-yielding grain sorghum cultivars were released at national level as well as at different sorghum growing states with regional adaptability for enhancing the productivity at the farmers’ fields. The farmers have a wide choice of hybrids, mostly released at national level, and varieties with both high grain and fodder yield to enhance the profitability out of sorghum farming in the dryland production systems. With a number of cultivars developed by the respective State Agricultural Universities, the local availability of quality seeds of these cultivars should not be a limitation to the farmers in adopting latest varietal technology to enhance their income. The renewed interest in millets and availability of latest high yielding cultivars will help in stabilizing the production of grain sorghum in the country. *Corresponding author e-mail: hari@millets.res.in Table 8 (Concluded) SCAN QR Code to Purchase Online Indian Farming 19 December 2023 Stevia farming: A moneymaking venture for farmers Pooja Rajendra Dhange1, Srinatha T N2* and Kavita Kandpal1 1University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560 065 ²ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi 110 012 India stands first in terms of population, along with rise in population, it also has world’s largest diabetic population. Major driving force for diabetes is linked with consumption of sugar or high glycemic rich foods. Stevia is a natural sweetener having nutritional, therapeutic and industrial importance. Stevia is popularly called as ‘methi tulsi’ by Indian farmers due to its sweet essence. Stevia leaf contains more than 20 steviol glycosides, such as stevioside and rebaudioside, which are 200–300 times sweeter than sucrose. It is widely used as zero calorie sweetener and a substitute for sugar all over the world. Wide range of climatic conditions of our country offers great scope for commercial cultivation of stevia for farming community as it is a perennial crop and gives high returns with B:C ratio of 1.86. Realizing the importance of stevia in global market, Government of India is also promoting this crop by providing technological support and subsidies.
