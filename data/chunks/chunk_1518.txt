 By focusing on the cultivation of drought-resistant fruits, vegetables, and other horticultural crops, dryland horticulture offers a sustainable solution for improving food security, enhancing farmer livelihoods, and promoting climate resilience. The yield of horticultural crops in dryland regions varies significantly based on the quantity and distribution of rainfall. Dryland horticulture emphasizes efficient water-use through techniques like drip irrigation, mulching, and rainwater harvesting, which maximize crop yields in water-scarce areas. By cultivating drought-tolerant crops such as fruits, nuts, and vegetables, farmers can increase their income and diversify production, boosting economic stability. This approach also supports climate- resilient farming, helping communities adapt to rising temperatures and erratic rainfall. Additionally, dryland Indian Farming 44 January 2025 horticulture enhances food security by providing a diverse, nutritious food supply and promotes sustainable land use practices that preserve soil health and prevent erosion. Utilizing native or adapted crops further aligns farming with local ecosystems, fostering biodiversity and long-term land productivity. Crop selection for dryland horticulture Choosing the right crops is critical for the success of dryland horticulture, especially in arid and semi- arid regions as the primary focus in crop selection for dryland horticulture is to identify species that are drought-tolerant, adaptable to harsh conditions, and capable of yielding high economic returns. Dryland crops should be deep-rooted and perennial, with low water requirements and the ability to withstand harsh conditions. These crops typically have small, thick, shiny leaves to minimize water loss. They should be hardy, capable of enduring intense monsoons, and able to shed leaves during the summer, with flowering and fruiting occurring in the rainy season. Examples of crops suited for dryland horticulture are given below. Fruit crops: Drought-tolerant fruit trees like fig, karonda, jamun, bael, phalsa, dates, ber, guava and pomegranate are ideal for dryland regions. These crops can thrive with minimal water and are known for their resilience to dry conditions. Table 1.
