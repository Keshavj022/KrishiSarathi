 The one-way ANOVA serves as a crucial statistical method for examining the differences among multiple groups and enables researchers to determine whether observed variation in a dependent variable is attributable to genuine differences between groups or merely due to random fluctuations. Eta square (η²) is a measure of effect size commonly used in the context of the one-way ANOVA or other types of linear models. It quantifies the proportion of total variation in the dependent variable that is attributable to the variation between groups, relative to the total variation across all observations. This statistical method is employed for comparing three or more means (Hesamian, 2016; Wahid et al., 2018). Moreover, the Levene’s test is a statistical method used to assess the equality of means across different groups or samples. It is often employed as a preliminary analysis before conducting certain parametric tests, such as the t-test or the one-way ANOVA, which assumes equal variances among groups. This test can compare the variability (or spread) of data within each group. It calculates a test statistic based on the absolute deviations of individual data points from their group means, then evaluates whether these deviations differ significantly between groups. If the P-value resulting from the Levene’s test is below a predetermined significance level (P=0.05), it suggests that the variances are significantly different between groups, indicating that the assumption of equal variances may not hold. In such cases, researchers may opt for alternative statistical tests that do not require the assumption of equal variances or apply appropriate adjustments to account for the unequal variances. If the P-value is above the significance level, it indicates that there is no significant differences in variances between groups, and the assumption of equal variances is reasonable for subsequent analyses. Further, the Welch’s test and Brown-Forsythe test are alternative statistical methods, which can be used to assess the equality of variances across different groups, similar to the Levene’s test. However, they are more robust when the assumption of equal variances is violated or when dealing with non-normally distributed data. Both the Welch’s test and Brown-Forsythe test are useful alternatives to the Levene’s test when dealing with non-normally distributed data or when the assumption of equal variances is violated. 4. Results and discussion 4.1. Spatio-temporal variation of agricultural efficiency in Karnataka Upon classifying agricultural efficiency index into four categories of low (<90.00), medium (90.00–110.00), high (110.00–130.00), and very high (>130.00), we can see the distinctive spatio-temporal variation of agricultural efficiency index as shown in Figure 2. During 2004–2005, the spatial distribution of agricultural efficiency index spanned from 73.69 (lowest) in Dharwad District to 211.
