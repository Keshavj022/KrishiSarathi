 Livestock Impact of climate change on livestock: Preliminary results of life cycle assessment (LCA) of green house gas (GHG) emission from the selected dairy farms in Karnataka, indicated that the CH4 emission from enteric fermentation (IPCC tier II) in dairy HF cross cows Change in establishment and future distribution of Bactrocera zonata in India, based on the establishment risk index (ERI) for current and future climatic (2050) conditions Change in number of generations per year of B. zonata in India, based on the generation index (GI) for current and future climatic (2050) conditions In vivo enteric methane emission measurement in cattle and sheep CLIMATE CHANGE AND RESILIENT AGRICULTURE DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 21 was 93.7 to 100.4 g/head/d. The CH4 emission from manure management system was 1.51 to 1.56 g/ head/d and nitrogen excretion was 96.7 to 116.6 g/ head/d. Supplementation of tamarind seed husk significantly reduced methane production in vitro and in vivo in cattle. Supplementation of condensed tannin (CT) and hydrolysable tannin (HT) at moderate levels significantly reduced methane production without altering digestibility in vitro. Similarly, supplementation of saponins at low level significantly reduced methane production in vitro. Further, supplementation of the combination of saponins, CT and HT was found most effective than individual supplementation in reducing methane production in vitro. Cattle: Differential expression profiling of bovine NOD1/2 and certain acute inflammatory cytokine genes during thermal stress among native and crossbred cattle revealed that during thermal stress NOD1/2 as well as certain cytokine gene expressions are significantly higher in native cattle compared to crossbred counterparts. Mitigating climatic stress through dietary approaches: Addition of magnesium sulphate @ 1.2 or 2.4 g/kg basal diets improved body weight, feed conversion, immuno-competence, cost economics and other welfare parameters during both hot (Apr–May, 31.0±0.70 to 37.0±1.4°C, RH, %: 58.0±1.3–70.1±0.6) and hot-humid (Aug-Sep, 26.0±0.10–34.2±0.36°C, RH,%: 76.3±0.9–86.1±0.1) summer but results were more encouraging at level 2.4 g/kg during hot-humid summer. Similarly, the adverse effects on growth, feed conversion and immunity caused by high ambient temperature during extreme summer (hot and hot-humid) could partially be ameliorated by addition of aspirin (500 mg/kg) in diet. Thermal adaptability of yak: Heat shock protein (HSP70) profile in blood plasma of yaks ranged from 0.2409 to 0.2513 ng/ml during winter. The HSP70 concentration was significantly higher during summer in comparison to winter. The HSP60 concentration was significantly higher during winter in lactating yaks. Fish Estimation of greenhouse gases: Emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) was estimated from prawn (Penaeus monodon and Litopenaeus vannamei) and fish (catla and rohu) culture ponds.
