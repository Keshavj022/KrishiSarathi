 Salient achievements • Two hundred and twenty-four germplasm accessions of Artocarpus heterophyllus collected from Eastern India were analyzed for population structure. Three distinct clusters without any geographical isolation were seen. • Method of preparation of alcoholic nano-silver having anti-viral and anti-biofilm efficacy standardized. • Differential proteins between X- and Y-spermatozoa of Indicus cattle have been identified which have use in immuno-sorting of sperms. • A nano-composite hydrogel has been developed for wound healing of fish (patent filed). • More than 15,000 SC/ST community farmers benefitted under different outreach programs. • Three high-yielding varieties of rice and one of Indian Mustard, developed in collaboration with ICAR-RCER, Patna, and BAU, Ranchi, were released by SVRC 4. Knowledge/skill/technologies/products other services available for different stake holders • A nano-composite hydrogel has been developed for wound healing of fish. The composite healed wounds completely within 15 days (patent filed). • FSHβ has been identified as a genetic marker for litter traits in indigenous pig breeds of India. This marker will help in the selection of parents for improved litter size. 25 Crop Science 25 A nano-composite hydrogel for wound healing of fish • Microbial levan-based feed formulation has been developed for rohu (Labeo rohita) fingerlings to induce cytokine-mediated immune modulation against pathogen challenges. 26 ICAR Institutes Profile 26 ICAR-Indian Institute of Maize Research 1.
