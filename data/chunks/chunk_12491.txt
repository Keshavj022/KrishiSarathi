 246 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 It is proposed to bring 2.10 lakh ha of current fallow into cultivable land.   Convert wasteland to cropped area: It is recommended that watershed based development may be extensively encouraged to bring large areas of cultivable waste into cropped area. It is envisaged to convert 50,000 ha of waste land through watershed development, bunding, land terracing, moisture conservation measures, water harvesting links etc.   Soil management: The soil of state mainly suffers from extreme to high acidity (50% of TGA), low to medium organic carbon (47% of TGA), low available N (20% of TGA), low available P (66%), low available potassium (18% of TGA), low available sulphur (38% of TGA), zinc deficiency (7%of TGA), and boron deficiency (45% of TGA). The problem of toxicity of iron and aluminium pose serious problem in moisture deficient regime. Multipronged strategy combining short-term and long-term approaches is fundamental for agricultural development of the State. Soil and water conservation: Some of the recommended systems for different situations are: i. Micro level water resource development through tank cum well system which works on drainage line in a watershed is recommended for plateau areas having slope of 2 to 5%; ii. Check-dams built across the direction of water flow on shallow rivers and streams for the purpose of water harvesting; iii. The farm ponds constructed at the lower side of the fields and the runoff from the higher side of the fields are channelized into the pond. Further facilitation of micro-irrigation through promotional schemes, setting up of demonstration-cum-training centres at district level is needed to bring in improved practice for water use efficiency. iv. Similarly, promotion of integrated nutrient management and use of slow-release fertilizers and micronutrients are needed for improving fertilizer use efficiency. Balanced use of major nutrients (NPK), provision of micronutrients like sulphur, zinc and boron can help to increase yield by over 50% in dryland farming areas.   Soil Health Cards: Lack of soil health cards has given lot of stress on the soil reserves of nutrients on account of wanton use of fertilizers without soil testing. While soil health care would have to be given utmost care in any agriculture development plan, it is envisaged that each farmer need to be given ‘Soil Health Card’ for his land which would contain all required information relating to pH factor, nutrient status, soil depth, texture and structure, organic matter.   Improve SRR: Seed replacement rate is around 10-15% currently. It should be possible to increase SRR initially to 30% and eventually to 50 or 75% by the end of the current plan by ensuring timely availability of certified seeds for which the state can assist the formation of seed villages in each district, arrange to supply foundation seeds and other infrastructure for seed production and processing.
