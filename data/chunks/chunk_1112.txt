Indian Farming 98 January 2023 120–150 eggs were produced by each bird annually and farmers sold these eggs at `10/egg which helped them to earn additional income of `13,000/year (Table 3). Most of the beneficiaries enhanced their income, as well as achieved partial nutritional security of their family by using sorghum feed and by-product wastage. Table 3.

Due to this intervention, farmers obtained additional returns up to 11 times more than un de-hulled grains of finger millet and little millet sold in the market (Table 1). Therefore, a primary processing centre of millets was run on the basis of custom hiring for millet farmers of accessible distance of surrounding villages. Skill development programs as well as exposure visits were organized for women and for other local entrepreneurs in view to promote value-added products through entrepreneurship development.
