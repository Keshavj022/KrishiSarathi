 Agro-climatic zone-wise strategies for enhancing crop productivity and net income of farmers   The strategies such as (i) enhancing productivity through cropping system approach, (ii) Agri-horti systems, (iii) Integrated farming systems, and (iv) livestock and fisheries as components in IFS models are furnished separately for each agro-climatic zone. Whereas, strategies such as (v) Processing and value addition and (vi) Reduction in cost of cultivation and (vi) Enhancing income from non-farm sources are discussed commonly for agro-climatic zones together.   Among the various possibilities for increasing the income for farmers, some may be realized within a year or so others may be realized over the years depending on the process involved fundamentally there are three approaches available for enhancing income of farmers’ viz., increase the gross income, reduce the costs and stabilize the income.   Broad strategies, activities and resource domain-wise action points are given under the following three approaches: i. Enhance Gross Income ii. Reduce Costs iii. Stabilize Income 541 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Approach 1. Enhancing Gross Income Strategy Activity Resource Domain Action Points Increasing Productivity Bridging Yield Gaps Irrigated Delineation of Crop Colonies based on soil, climate, water etc. Wider adoption of improved varieties/ hybrids and improved practices of rice, maize, pulses, millets &fodder crops. Implementation & popularization of improved soil & water management technologies in farmer’s fields. Implementation & popularization of plasti-culture interventions viz., bed cultivation, drip irrigation & fertigation & plastic mulch in field & horticultural crops (More Crop and Income per Drop of Water). Popularization of growing vegetables flowers & herbs in greenhouses/poly houses. Implementation of soil test based fertilizer management. Popularization of multiple cropping –Crop rotation, double cropping systems. Implementation & popularization of seed to seed mechanization in rice, cotton, soybean, pulses, groundnut & sugarcane Bridging Yield Gaps Rainfed Delineation of Crop Colonies based on soil, climate, moisture availability period and potential for supplemental irrigation. Implementation & Popularization of agro- ecology specific (soil & rainfall) in situ moisture conservation practices. Popularization of recommended tank silt application in light textured soils. Mapping potential sites for rainwater harvesting in farm ponds. Popularization of farm pond technology package (selection of ideal site, digging, harvesting, lining, minimizing, evaporation losses, lifting pump, micro- irrigation system) including efficient utilization of stored water for higher water productivity (More Crop and Income per Drop of Water). Popularization of rainfed crops/ varieties with wider adaptability and resilience to climate variability for enhanced yield.
