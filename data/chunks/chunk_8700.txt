These fishes have further been grouped into classified ornamental fishes and non-classified ornamental fishes. Transfer of Technology l The development of watershed-based technologies could check the soil loss from 46 tonnes/ha to 5 tonnes/ha. Having achieved this, the Institute extended State Discipline 2002–2003 (centre/location) Allocation for Expenditure/ NEH release on 30.11.2002 State Discipline 2002–2003 (centre/location) Allocation for Expenditure/ NEH release on 30.11.2002 RESEARCH FOR TRIBAL AND HILL REGIONS 189 l Staggered planting at 1-month intervals recommended for round-the- year availability of tuberose flowers l Brinjal somaclones developed. l Herbal antimicrobial; anti-inflammatory and anti-histaminic formulation; mouth wash; and vaginal contraceptive developed and under processing for patent and marketing. l Large-scale production of Quicken (fertile intergeneric hybrid) initiated in quail farming under deep litter system. Bark paste of Planchonia andamanica can be used for treating the fungal infection the technology to the nearby villages through the development of watershed known as Shippra Watershed. Besides developing 3 fishery ponds in the area, soil-conservation measures were also initiated by way of contour bunding, half-moon terracing etc. Upper ridges were put under horticultural crops while the lower ones were developed for agricultural purposes. l Farmers from the NEH states have not only been trained on the use of modified farm implements but also were given skill-oriented training to manufacture the implements themselves. l A technology was perfected for processing of soybean into products like soya milk, soya paneer and soya biscuit. The technology has been transferred to the people through the Departments of Agriculture of various states of the region.
