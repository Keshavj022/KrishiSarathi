 It is a dual- purpose hybrid and has recorded superior grain and fodder yields in multilocation trials DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 24 8K (Y) and Y 75. It was found that cultivars developed with CS 3541 in their parentage contributed to high degree of resistance in R lines (C 43, RS 29, MR 836). PEARL MILLET Crop Improvement Three hybrids and one open-pollinated variety have been released. l Released CZP 9802 pearl millet, an open-pollinated variety. GHB 558 pearl millet kharif hybrid. It is a late-maturing, downy-mildew resistant, high stover yielding hybrid; yields 2.83 tonnes/ha across the country Pearl millet summer hybrid GHB 526, yielding 4 tonnes/ha, is a late-maturing, high stover giving hybrid Pearl millet hybrids/varieties released Hybrids/ Area of Mean Salient features varieties recommendation grain yield (tonnes/ha) Kharif Hybrids GHB 558 Across the country 2.83 Late maturity (80–82 days), downy-mildew resistant and high stover yield HHB 146 Haryana, Rajasthan, 2.88 Medium maturity (78–80 days), Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, downy-mildew resistant Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Delhi Summer Hybrids GHB 526 Gujarat, Maharashtra, 4.00 Late maturity and high stover Tamil Nadu and parts yield of Rajasthan Variety CZP 9802 Rajasthan, Gujarat 1.30 Medium early maturity and Haryana (75–78 days), suitable for scanty rainfall regions CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 25 Crop Production and Crop Protection Newly developed hybrid HHB 146 has been found most responsive to all levels of nitrogen. This recorded higher yield of 12.4% at 30 kg, 16.3% at 60 kg and of 15.2% at 90 kg over the best check hybrid. Hybrids MH 1040, MH 1066 and a variety MP 403 have been identified for combined resistance to downy mildew and smut diseases. And MH 1003 has showed promise against shootfly, pyrilla and grey weevil insects. SMALL MILLETS Crop Improvement Fingermillet L5, a long-duration variety, maturing in 115-120 days, with a high level of field tolerance to blast, has been released for cultivation in Karnataka. Little millet OLM 20, an early-maturing variety of 75-80 days duration, suitable for double cropping, has been released for cultivation in Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Foxtail millet accession GS 1953, a unique, dwarf plant-type with erect leaves and desirable morphological frame, controlled by single recessive genes, has been registered with the NBPGR. Crop Production and Crop Protection Intercropping fingermillet and pigeonpea in 4:1 or 8:2 ratio is profitable in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. This enhanced farming income as well as supply of grain-legumes. Soaf (0.2%) was effective against fingermillet blast, and in preventing yield losses to the tune of 15-20% due to diseases. In the National Screening Nursery, kodomillet GPLM 920 and GPLM 1029, found resistant to head smut, can be donors for resistance.
