 The extent of control in T2 was 91.8% followed by 94.2% in T3 and the highest of 95.7% in T4, which indicates that T4 gave the best control measure. However, T3, i.e. application of parso leaves @ 100 kg/ha with 94.2% control is quite on a par with that of T4. Data presented in Table 4 show that in the control (T1), there was a gradual increase in gall- midge infestation from 6.0% at 30 DAT to 8.3% at 45 DAT and finally to 9.8% at 60 DAT in 2002- 03. The same trend was observed in the revalidation trial of 2003-04, where the infestation increased from 3.0% at 25 DAT to 4.2% at 30 DAT and further Table 3. Extent of control (%) -Ranchi (2003-04) to 6.5% at 45 DAT and 7.0% at 60 DAT. In the next treatment T2, where parso leaves were applied @ 50 kg/ha, the pooled figures of the years 2002-03 & 2004, the infestation decreased from 2.8% at 30 DAT to 1.31 % at 45 DAT and finally to 1.1 % at 60 DAT. The third treatment, T,, i.e. application of parso leaves @ 100 kg/ha, was applied only in 2003-04. Here also the infestation shows a decline from 2.0% at 30 DAT to 0.05% at 60 DAT. The maximum decline was observed in carbofruran application (T4), where the pooled values decreased from 2.6% at 30 DAT to 1.59% at 45 DAT and finally to 1.0% at 60 DAT. The data presented in Table 5 indicate that gall fly affected shoots increased under control treatment from 3.3% on 25 DAT to 8.4% on 60 DAT. On the contrary in all the treatments where either ITK or carbofuran was used, the gallfly affected shoots decreased. The reduction in gallfly-affected shoots was maximum where parso leaf @ 100 kg/ha was applied. Reduction in gallfly-affected shoots was similar in the treatment where either parso leaf was applied @ 50 kg/ha or carbofuran was applied @ 30 kg/ha. The infestation of gall-fly was mild, spanning over a brief period, at Central Research Farm, BCKV. At 60 DAT the average percentage of silver shoots observed in plots treated with parso leaves and carbofuran was 1.50% and 1.06% respectively compared with 3.02% in untreated control.
