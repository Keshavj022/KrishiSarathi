 • Cardamom root grub can be checked effectively by drenching with imidacloprid (0.75 ml/l) or chlorpyriphos (0.07%) and maximum yield 412 g/plant and highest B: C ratio (1:1.65) could be realized. Ginger • The centers maintain 603 accessions in ginger. Accessions V1E8‐8, V2E5‐2, & Turai local (Pottangi) Gorubathan (Pundibari) were found promising in respect of yield. • Application of inorganic N 100% + Azospirillum 50g/bed +5kg FYM recorded maximum yield of 31.46 t/ha. in ginger. • Application of Azospirillum (50g) along with recommended fertilizer schedule proved better in augmenting ginger yield. • Application of zinc sulphate @ 25.0 kg/ha produced maximum ginger yield (20.27t/ha). • Rhizome rot of ginger was controlled by pre‐treating the seed rhizomes in hot water at 51oC for 10 min. and T. harzianum mixed with neem cake for 30 minutes before planting the rhizomes. Turmeric • The centers hold 1332 germplasm accessions. • Turmeric PTS‐11, PTS‐39 (Pottangi) NDH‐18 (Kumarganj) RH‐5, JTS‐72, JTS‐314, JTS‐612 (Jagtial) T‐1 (Raigarh) CL‐101 (Coimbatore). • R H 9190 (Dholi) TCP‐11 (Pundibari) were promising. • Application of NPK 125: 60:90 kg/ha +FYM 10t/ha +T.viride + Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 4g kg/ha as seed treatment and T. viride + P. fluorescens applied to soil (12.5kg & 25.0 kg/ha) as basal and top dressing respectively resulted in higher yield (28.60 t/ha) with lowest rhizome rot incidence . • In turmeric higher yield could be obtained by applying inorganic nitrogen 75% +Azospirillum 5 kg/ha + FYM 5 t/ha. • Application of organic inputs viz. FYM 10 kg, Pongamia cake 250 g, sterameal 250 g, rock phosphate 500g, wood ash 250g per 3 m2 bed produced turmeric yield of 6.71 kg/3m2 compared to 7.76 kg/3m2 with application of inorganic materials. www.icar.org.in 71 2002‐2007 • Foliar disease, viz. leaf spot and leaf blotch could be effectively controlled by application of mancozeb + carbendazim (0.2%) as seed treatment and 2‐3 foliar sprays (0.3%). Tree Spices • The centers maintain a total of 202 tree spices accessions (in clove, nutmeg & cinnamon). • Soft wood grafting techniques in nutmeg is successful. October‐March was found to be most congenial particularly January month with highest success of 68.33%. Seed Spices Coriander • The centers maintain 1736 coriander accessions including 128 exotic accessions. • Coriander LCC‐174, LCC‐128 (Guntur) K. selection (Kumarganj) DH‐205 (Hisar) were found promising. • Coriander varieties Hisar Surabhi from HAU, Hisar which given an yield of 1800‐2000 kg/ha; RCr‐ 480 from Jobner yielding 1325 kg/ha; Sudha from Guntur yields 1200‐1500 kg/ha (under irrigation) were identified for release. • In coriander, micronutrient spray viz. Zn SO4 + FeSO4 + Cu SO4 +Mn SO4 (each at 0.5%) recorded higher yield (940 kg/ha). • Application of 100 % inorganic nitrogen + Azospirillum @ 1.5 kg/ha + 5 t FYM /ha resulted in maximum seed yield (3.45 t/ha). • Spraying of bioregulator Triacontanol @ 0.
