 The impact of maize-wheat-mungbean cropping system was prominently observed with respect to CRe 0Kover rice-wheat-mungbean system; whereas the effect of irrigation method was not significantly distinguishable. The study thus highlights the potential of long term crop residue retention under CA for improving and maintaining K supply to crops. 1. Introduction Potassium (K) is one of the important macronutrients which greatly impacts crop growth, yield and quality of produce. Besides its essential role in crop nutrition, it is also crucial for soil health as it provides stability to various soil minerals (Das et al., 2019). Over the period of time, intensive cropping systems have led to depletion of soil K (Islam et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2013). However, policies and fertilizer rec­ ommendations are quite biased towards nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) application based on the assumption of adequate availability of K in * Corresponding authors.

Comparing the uptake of K and N by crops, K uptake is often found to be comparable or higher than the N uptake. However, in India, consumption ratio of N, P and K fertilizer is reported to be 6.7:2.4:1 (Reddy, 2019) which is highly biased towards N as against the ideal ratio of 4:2:1, recommended by the Fertilizer Association of India (FAI, 2019). The fact itself high­ lights the imbalance in K fertilization. Intensive crop production practices adopted especially in the Indo Gangetic Plains (IGP) in northwest India for obtaining a boom in food production have been the most prominent reasons of soil degradation and loss of soil fertility (Bhattacharyya et al., 2015). As an alternative to the conventional agricultural practices, conservation agriculture (CA) practices are gradually gaining momentum for managing problems arising due to conventional tillage (CT) practices thus reducing overall cost of production and in turn helping in addressing soil sustainability goals (Vermeulen et al., 2019). Crop residue burning is a serious concern in North-West India. In IGP areas, rice and wheat residues are burnt at the rate of 44.5 million tonne (Mt) and 24.5 Mt per year, respectively (Singh and Sidhu, 2014). In this aspect, CA could be a better manage­ ment strategy which apart from utilizing crop residues, augments physicochemical properties of soil (Jat et al., 2018; Somasundaram et al., 2019). About 500 Mt of crop residues are generated annually, 75% of which comprises cereal straw (MNRE, 2009).
