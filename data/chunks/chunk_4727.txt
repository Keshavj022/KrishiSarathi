The tree is of widespread occurrence growing on marginal lands in semi-arid and sub-humid tropical climates, making it highly valuable in ensuring food security for rural poor. Given the great potential of this neglected and underutilized species to address global challenges such as hunger, poverty and climate change adaptation, there is a need to revisit research and development priorities in its favour and to develop strategies together with stakeholders to increase its use. T amarind (Tamarindus indica) is an evergreen tree legume, distributed all over the world in tropical and sub-tropical countries. The tree produces fruits in pods which consist of a brittle outer shell encapsulating the pulp and enclosed seeds. Once established, the tree develops a large tap root which protects it from strong winds and cyclones, making it well suited to the region prone to such weather phenomena. It is also considered to be a suitable tree for inter-planting with other commercial forest species. Tamarind starts bearing from 6-8 years and has productive life of 50-70 years after which it declines. The normal life span of the tree is 150 years. A typical established tree yields between 50-100 Kg of collectable fruit which is harvested during multiple picks over an 8-10-week period between February and April. Apart from tamarind pulp other by-products such as seed, shell, fiber is also useful for various purposes. Tamarind comes in two main types; sweet and sour.
