 Number of infected brinjal shoots and fruits/m2, yield (q/ha) and economics under field experimentation Treatment No. of infected shoots/m2 No. of infected fruits/m2 Yield (q/ha) Net return (Rs/ha) Return/Rupee spent (Rs/Re) Control 11.2 10.6 245.0 33,086.00 1.84 Use of tobacco-soaked water 1.4 1.05 354.0 1,35,906.00 4.31 Use of endosulphan 1.2 0.85 365.0 1,39,886.00 4.28 CD (P=0.05) 0.32 0.57 17.4 1,245.00 0.43 endosulphan than rest of the treatments with a net return of Rs 1,35,906/ha and Rs 33,086/ha obtained by spraying tobacco soaked water and control, respectively. The data show that about 3.0% more net return was obtained by use of endosulphan over tobacco soaked water. Further, it is revealed from Table 2 that about 75% more net return could be obtained through use of ITK practice and improved practice over control. However, the highest return/rupee spent (Rs 4.31/Re) was recorded when tobacco soaked water was used to control shoot and fruit borer in brinjal which was Rs 4.28/Re in case of use of endosulphan. The net return when no treatment was given (control) was 1.84 Rs/Re. CONCLUSION On the basis of results of the field experiment, it may be concluded that for controlling shoot and fruit borer in brinjal, spraying of tobacco soaked water is equally effective as that of using endosulphan.  HORTICULTURAL CROPS Code : 366 Title of the ITK : Use of kochila (Strichnos nuxvomica)-mixed cowdung compost in brinjal for controlling fruit and shoot borer Description of the ITK : Cowdung, 10 kg kochila (Struchnos nux-vomica) seed powder and 25 kg kochila leaf are put in a compost pit of 10 × 3 × 3 feet by mixing thoroughly. Then 10 litre cow urine is added to the pit for 10 consecutive days and covered with soil. After 2 months the compost becomes ready. This compost (5 g) is added to each plant once at the time of sowing and at 45 days after planting. Due to its repellent action, incidence of shoot and fruit borer is reduced.
