 Farmers are still preferring Happy seeder for its higher yield advantage in wheat. Zero till seed drill: The Zero till seed drill is an innovative agricultural tool that revolutionizes wheat sowing practices. Unlike traditional methods that involve plowing and tilling the soil before seeding, the Zero till seed drill allows farmers to sow wheat directly into untilled soil, minimizing soil disturbance. This conservation tillage approach helps retain soil moisture, prevents erosion, and promotes overall soil health. The machine features precision seed placement, ensuring optimal spacing and depth for uniform crop emergence. The Zero till seed drill is a sustainable solution, saving time and energy while contributing to enhanced wheat yields and environmental conservation. — : Wheat sowing by Zero till seed drill Crop residue management project The Government has taken proactive measures to combat the detrimental practice of residue burning through the implementation of a centrally sponsored scheme "Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for in-situ Management of Crop Residue", since 2018. The scheme has’ been collaboratively implemented by DAFW, ICAR, State Agriculture Departments and 60 frontline extension institutions (KVKs) spread in the districts of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Wheat yield and cost of cultivation Agricultural machines (Happy seeder, super seeder, and Zero till seed drill) were demonstrated on the farmers’ fields. These machines were utilized for sowing of wheat consequently managed rice residue in situ and also contributed significantly to increase the crop yields compared to conventional methods of sowing. The use of happy seeder machine yielded the highest grain yield of 51.74 q/ha of wheat in demonstration plots. The grain yield of wheat under super seeder and Zero till seed drill were almost equivalent at 50.91 q/ha and 50.89 q/ha, respectively. While the conventional methods of sowing March 2024 19 Indian Farming 20 March 2024 of wheat, due to its limitations, yielded the lowest of 47.86 q/ha, it incurred the maximum cost of cultivation of `41787/ha closely by `41201/ha by super seeder. Use of happy seeder incurred total cost of `35537/ha in wheat cultivation slightly higher than the lowest of `34926/ha under Zero till seed drill. 30000 32000 34000 36000 38000 40000 42000 Happy seeder Super seeder Zero till seed drill Check 35537 41201 34926 41787 Fig. 2.

Besides, 331 training programmes were also conducted in which 13,746 farmers were trained for residue management practices.
