 SUMMARY Surface seeding is a viable option for in-situ management of crop residue. As this technique does not require any costly machines and high-power tractors, it is mucheconomical compared to other residue management approaches. It could be proven as boon to resource poor small and marginal farmers who are otherwise not able to purchase costly machinery to manage crop residues. The adoption of surface seeding practices has the potential to increase the production of wheat and mitigation of heat stress as also registered by the farmers. Efforts are needed to motivate the farmers towards this technology through awareness programmes and demonstrations in farmers’ field. As this is a very young technology, it needs further validation in term of seed rate, fertilizer application, type of soil suited for this technique and quantity of irrigation to be applied, etc. *Corresponding author email: anilkumarhpkv@gmail.com © AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE (ATARI) g 11 ATARIs for Effective Monitoring KVK T Zone State 5 .
