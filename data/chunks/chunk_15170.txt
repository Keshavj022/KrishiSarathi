 By offering more precise and accurate suggestions for crop selection and cultivation, it is possible to assist farmers in enhancing their productivity and efficiency, which can ultimately result in increased profitability and food security. Despite the huge implications of the study, it should be noted that the authors in the present study used public dataset, more datasets across the globe could have resulted in more pragmatic findings from which the wider community could harvest the benefit. Therefore. It is recommended to set more experiments in the field in wider environmental conditions to generate quality data for modelling using various ML algorithms. Funding Funding institutions in the public, commercial, or nonprofit sectors did not award a specific grant for this research. However, Center for Research in Environment, iGen and Livelihood (CREGL) provide us substantial logistic support to accomplish the work.
