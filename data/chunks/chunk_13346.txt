Among the smaller Divisions, Ag. Education Division organized maximum number of trainings (75) for all categories of employees during 2016-18. Table 12. SMD-wise number of trainings organized for various categories of employees S: Scientist; T: Technical including Drivers; Admn: Administrative including Finance & Stenographers; SSS: Skilled Support Staff 10. Training Management Information System (TMIS) Training Management Information System is the activity of recording and maintenance of the crucial data related to the training activities that are carried out in each ICAR- Institutes/HQs. As the saying goes, ìWhat is not recorded cannot be measured and what is not measured cannot be improvedî. Therefore, it is required that the various data items pertaining to the training management should be captured and recorded so that the various efficiency/effectiveness factors can be measured. Similarly, if the efficiency and effectiveness factors are measured, then they can be analysed and required improvement measures can be arrived at. Basically, it will ease out the training management process.Training Management Information System helps in tracking different aspects of training. Following are the components of TMIS: ï Training Application Process (Application) ï Training Feedback Process (Feedback) ï Training Evaluation Process (Performance Indicators) ï Training Needs/Gap Assessment (TNA) For the first time in ICAR, the responsibility of developing, testing, implementing and executing the TMIS was assigned to IASRI, New Delhi with overall supervision of HRM Unit, ICAR HQs. The basic framework of TMIS has been developed by NAARM, Hyderabad in consultation with HRM Unit. The first two processes have been completed by IASRI, New Delhi so far.
