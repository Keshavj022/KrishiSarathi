 field area = 30 acres of wheat. The following steps are used to calculate other parameters [57–59]. Step 1 Calculation of total water requirement for the taken field ●Assume that water consumption for 1 acre of wheat in m3/ day = 4 m3/day ●Total amount required per day = 30 × 4 = 120 m3/day Step 2 To find the proper water source to supply water requirements ●Underground water is employed as a water source from which one may receive appropriate water supply throughout the year and pure water without any solid waste that can harm the system. Step 3 Making of system layout ●Included are the necessary distances and elevations for the intake, pump, PV panel, water tank, and water delivery locations. Step 4 Design of solar insolation and PV panel installations on-site ●Selection of tilt angle is essential for getting maximum energy. Step 5 Calculation of water flow rate in m3/hour ●Water flow rate (Q) = 120/24 = 5 m3/h ●Let Pipe diameter = 6 inches Step 6 Calculation of total dynamic head (TDH) ●TDH = static head + suction head + friction losses ●Static head + suction head = 40 + 7 = 47 m ●Frictional losses (Ploss) Ploss = 4.53 × L × ( Q C )1.852 D4.857 (1) where Q = flow rate (m3/sec), D = diameter of pipe in m, L = Pipe length in m, C = pipe coefficient which is for PVC = 150, Aluminum = 120, Galvanized steel = 140, Cast Iron/old steel = 100. Assume C = 150 m, L = 100 m, flow rate Q = 5 m3/h, 1 inch = 2.54 cm. We will get friction losses = 0.297 m by substituting all these values. Therefore TDH = 47 + 0.297 = 47.297 m. Fig. 4. Step-wise-step workflow for solar PV pumping system modeling using PVSyst. A.K. Yadav et al. Results in Engineering 23 (2024) 102584 6 Step 7 Calculation of Normalized Energy Output Normalized energy output refers to the energy produced by a PV system per unit of installed power capacity. It is usually expressed in kWh/kWp, where kWh is the kilowatt-hours of energy produced, and kWp (kilowatt-peak) is the installed peak power capacity of the PV system. The normalized energy output is calculated by dividing the total energy produced by the PV system over a specific period (usually a day, month, or year) by the system’s installed peak power capacity. Step 8 Calculation of performance ratio (PR) PR = Energy measured (kWh)/(Irradiance (kWh/m2) on the panel × Active area of PV module (m2) × PV module efficiency. 3. Results and discussions In this study, the PV pumping system is designed based on farmer problems such as water requirement for irrigation in different climatic conditions of India such as composite, warm and humid, hot and dry, temperate and cold. Normalized energy for Patna, Amaravati, Jaisalmer, Bangalore, and Itanagar are shown in Fig. 5a–e, respectively. July months have minimum normalized energy due to cloudy season results, which give rise to the minimum value of solar radiation. Unused energy for these climatic conditions varies from 0.93 to 1.8 kWh/kWp/day.
