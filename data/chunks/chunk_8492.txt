 A number of entries of sunflower Bio 82023, Krishidhan 34, JKSF 1014, PRO 001, CROSS MECHANISM FOR STRAIGHT SOWING OF SOYBEAN To ensure straight sowing in rows of soybean and to facilitate flawless interculture/harvesting operations subsequently in the standing crop using tractor-drawn implements, a cross mechanism has been developed at the National Research Centre on Soybean. This cross mechanism practically eliminates lateral movement of implements and can be conveniently fitted on the lower links of the tractor. This device can be manufactured by the local artisans at a meagre cost of Rs 80 only. CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 31 TWCH 23298, MLSFH 89, Ajit 511, VSFH 80, NJSFH 1136, SH 357, Krishidhan 9953, Mahabeej 2001, TWC 23248, PAC 39001, MLSFH 84, MLSFH 82 and PSH 21 have been found tolerant to downy mildew. Crop Production In Vidarbha region (Maharashtra) in soybean + sunflower intercropping system (2 : 1), application of 100% recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) to soybean and 50% RDF to sunflower as basal and 50% N as top dressing is recommended to get highest yield and monetary returns. Crop residue incorporation of sunflower in sorghum significantly increased grain yield of sorghum even with 50% RDF to the system. Phosphorus solubilizing bacteria provided up to 50% P requirement for sorghum, succeeding 100% RDF-grown sunflower. Crop Protection The pollen and thrips collected from the infected flower heads of sunflower were reported ELISA positive to sunflower necrosis virus antisera. Thrips could easily carry 30â€“70 pollen-grains on their body. This indicates thrips as vector of sunflower necrosis disease. Seed treatment with GAUCHO (Imidacloprid) at 5g/kg seed, followed by foliar spray of Confidor 200 SL at 0.05% at 15 and 30 DAS interval were effective in checking necrosis disease. A number of entries PAC 1091, DRSF 109, LSH 8, LSF 1, DRSF 110, PAC 31007, ZSH 9903, PWCH 23248, SH 416, PAC 39004, SH 323, PGS 362 and 243 have been found resistant to leaf hoppers. SAFFLOWER Crop Improvement A new non-spiny hybrid of safflower NARI-NH 1 (PH 6) has been developed at the Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute, Phaltan. It is suitable for all safflower- growing regions of the country. The average yield of this hybrid is 1.93 tonnes/ha. It is tolerant to Alternaria and Cercospora leaf-spot diseases and Fusarium wilt, besides showing tolerance to aphids. Safflower several germplasm accessions GMU nos. 2912, 2962, 2976 and 2720 have showed moderate resistance to leaf spot disease. And germplasm accessions GMU Nos. 2297, 2450, 2720, 2764, 2894 and 2914 have been found resistant to wilt. Safflower genotypes SSF 593-1 and PH 4 have exhibited resistant reaction to Alternaria leaf spot. A number of promising genotypes such as SSF 637, NH 13, SSF 413-2, JSI 112, JSI 5-1-7, PBNS 43 and PBNS 119 have showed tolerance to aphid infestation. NSKE 5%, NSK powder 3% and neem-cake 5% are found effective and economical for aphids' management.
