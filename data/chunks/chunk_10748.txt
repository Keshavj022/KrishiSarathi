 For the cultivation of these crops, it is very important to make the farmers aware about the scientific techniques so that the farmers of the state can take full advantage these latest developed techniques. Therefore, the scientific advisories for the cultivation of various crops grown in Kharif season are as under. Maize   Land preparations and sowing of maize in high altitude areas may be completed from 15th April to 15th May using composite variety Girija for timely sowing and Bajaura Makka, Bajaura Popcorn, Bajaura sweet corn for late sowing, whereas in mid and low hills the same may be completed from 20th May to 15th June and 15th June to 30th June, respectively using composite variety Girija and Palam Sankar Makka-2 for timely sowing and Bajaura Makka, Bajaura Popcorn for late sowing. University tested hybrids can also be procured from department of Agriculture for sowing of maize in different zones of Himachal Pradesh.   Spacing for maize may be maintained at 60x20 cm so that optimum plant population of 75000- 83000 plants could be maintained as population less than 50000 affect the yield drastically,   In areas with high rainfall, apply NPK in hybrid varieties using FYM and NPK @ 120:60:40 kg and in areas with low rainfall @ 90:45:30 kg per hectare. In local varieties, apply NPK @ 80:40:30 and 60:30:20 kg per hectare in high and low rainfall areas respectively. Apply full dose of P & K at sowing and two split doses of N at first earthing up and one month thereafter should be used.   For weed control in maize pre-emergence herbicide Atrazine @ 1.5-2.0 kg a.i//ha for sole crops while alachlor @ @ 1.5 kg /ha can be used for mixed cropping systems   In areas where cutworm and white grubs are serious pests, chlorpyriphos @ 2.0 litre per ha mixed in 60-70 kg sandy soil may be used for soil amendment before sowing or cypermethrin 10EC @ 1ml per litre may be used for foliar application.   Monitor the crop to manage the fall army worm pest. If the leaves are damaged or insect faeces are seen, then apply Flubendamide (Feme) or Emamectin Benzoate or Chlorantraniliprol @0.5 ml/L to the infested plants. Spray these insecticides as and when infestation of the pest observed in the entire field. Paddy (Rice)   Nursery sowing @ 25 kg seed/ha after seed treatment with bavistin @ 2.5 g/kg for timely sown rice may be completed from 20th May to first week of June using high yielding varieties HPR 1068, HPR 2143, RP 2421, HPR 2720, HPR 2880; university recommended / tested rice hybrids like Arize 6129, Arize Swift Arize Swift Gold, BS 10008 etc. (in areas below 1000 m amsl) and transplanting may be completed using 25-30 days old seedlings by end of June, In case of basmati rice high yielding and disease resistant varieties Kasturi and HPR 2612 could be used. For late sowing conditions also, high yielding short duration variety HPR 2612 can be used.
