 Coconut is grown in most of the districts of Assam covering the Upper (Charaideo, Dhemaji, Dibrugarh, Golaghat, Jorhat, Lakhimpur, Majuli, Sivasagar and Tinsukia), Central (Dima Hasao, Hojai, East Karbi Anglong, West Karbi Anglong, Morigaon and Nagaon), Lower (Baksa, Barpeta, Bongaigaon, Chirang, Dhubri, Goalpara, Nalbari, Kamrup (M), Kamrup (R), Kokrajhar and South Salmara- Mankachar), Hills and Barak Valley (Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj) and North Assam (Biswanath, Darrang, Sonitpur and Udalguri). The agro-ecological situation of these districts is congenial for coconut cultivation. Coconut can perform well under soil types such as red sandy loam, alluvial red loam and laterite soils and sub-tropical weather condition receiving an annual rainfall of 1,840 mm to 3,200 mm prevailing in these areas. The low productivity of coconut in Assam, which is less than the national average, is mainly attributed to the lack of adoption of scientific cultivation practices including improved varieties, multiple cropping and integrated farming systems, integrated nutrient management and integrated pest and disease management. If nurtured properly, coconut can be a good source of income for the farmers, even in the small holdings under homestead system. Tripura Tripura ranks second among the Northeastern states after Assam in the area under cultivation of coconut. Coconut is cultivated in 4,610 ha with a production of 18.44 million nuts and productivity of 3,996 nuts per ha.
