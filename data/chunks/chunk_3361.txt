 Agricultural human resource development is a continuous process being undertaken through partnership and efforts of the components of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) - Agricultural Universities (AUs) System comprising 53 State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), five Deemed to be universities (DUs), one Central Agricultural University (CAU) and four Central Universities (CUs) with Agriculture Faculty. The Agricultural Universities in India set up on the ‘land grant’ pattern of USA have contributed immensely to human resource development as well as enhancement of agricultural productivity and production in the country over the years. The system of education in Agricultural Universities was basically taken from USA pattern, that greatly enabled incorporation of a number of diverse subjects in the courses as also provision of hands-on practical experience to the students. Agricultural education has now to evolve in tune with fast changing national and international scenario. Future agriculture is dominated by looming dangers of food insecurity originating from an unholy alliance of existing and emerging issues such as stagnating/declining productivity and profitability; degradation and depletion of natural resources; increased risks in the face of changing climate; unsafe livelihoods for millions of small and marginal farmers; regional imbalances in agricultural productivity; rising 3 input costs, unsound profits and vulnerable markets; changing food habits and quality concerns; high post- harvest losses and fragmented processing industry; globalization of trade and commerce; weakened technology transfer system; fossil fuel crisis and growing emphasis on bio-fuels encroaching upon good agricultural lands; poorly coordinated natural disaster management system, and the looming prospects of bioterrorism etc. The present situation demands a renewed thrust for enhanced quality and relevance of higher agricultural education so as to facilitate and undertake human capacity building for developing self-motivated professionals and entrepreneurs in view the changing scenario of globalization of education, emergence of new areas of specialization such as IPRs, other WTO-related areas, techno-legal specialties etc., and the cutting edge technologies such as biosensors, genomics and biotechnology, alternative sources of energy, nanotechnology, etc. The graduates are required to possess professional capabilities to deal with the concerns of sustainable development (productive, profitable and stable) of agriculture in all its aspects. Also, the education should address the stakeholders’ expectations especially for utilitarian mode. Further, there is need for agricultural graduates having knowledge, skills, ability and also entrepreneurship to provide a class of village-based services such as diagnostic laboratories, advisories on new innovations, markets and avenues of development assistance for corporate and contract farming.
