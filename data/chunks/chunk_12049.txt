 Name of technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/species): BioFort -Microbial formulation for effective micronutrient mobilization to wheat and rice grains Two formulations, each containing a consortium of three plant growth promoting rhizobacteria were developed - (Bacillus pumilus PW1 + Providencia sp. PW5 + Brevundimonas diminuta PW7) for wheat and (Providencia sp. PR3 + B. diminuta PR7 + Ochrobactrum anthropi PR10) for rice. Field trials have proved that these inoculants can be used interchangeably in both crops 2. Target crops and delivery system: These microbial formulations (using compost: vermiculite, 1:1 as carrier) can enhance plant growth, improves N and P nutrient availability/ uptake and significant micronutrient enrichment of grains in rice and wheat. Shelf life tested for six months with no significant loss of activity, if stored in shade below 25 ºC 3. Target agroecological zones: Indo-Gangetic plains 4. Validation and commercialization: Validated at IARI fields. Already registered at Zonal Technology Management & Business Planning and Development Unit , ICAR-IARI, New Delhi 5. Benefits: Application rate is 300 g /acre. Effective micronutrient mobilization to grains, with 13 – 40% increase in Fe, Zn and Mn concentrations. 40-60 kg N savings/ha/season/crop. 10-15% increase in yields 6.

Name of technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/species): Cyanobiocon A & C - Two formulations, each containing a native cyanobacterial strain - Anabaena laxa (A) or Calothrix elenkinii (C), which exhibit fungicidal activity activity against phytopathogenic fungi (Fusarium oxysporum / F. solani, Rhizoctonia solani, Macrophomina phaseolina, Magnaporthe oryzae and Pythium aphanidermatum / P. debaryanum). 2. Target crops and delivery system: Nursery grown vegetables, cotton and rice. The formulations are not crop-specific and can be promising biocontrol formulations for use in integrated practices for the management of fungal diseases in a wide range of crops, particularly against soil-borne diseases, highly problematic nursery grown crops. Shelf life: Six months, if stored in shade below 25 ºC. Using compost: vermiculite, 1:1 as carrier, these formulations can be used as seed dressing or seedling dip or mixed in soil before sowing; also being developed as soil drench and potting mix supplements. 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): Irrespective of zones/soil types/agroecologies 4. Validation and commercialization: Validated in IARI field, already registered at Zonal Technology Management & Business Planning and Development Unit , ICAR-IARI, New Delhi. 5.
