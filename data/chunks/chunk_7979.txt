 Development and commercialization of Bio NPK formulation: A liquid Bio NPK formulation containing nitrogen-fixing (Azotobacter chroococcum), P- solubilizing (Paenibacillus tylopili) and K-solubilizing (Bacillus decolorationis) bacteria was developed and validated for performance. The three microbs are compatible and coexist in the liquid formulation with an extended shelf-life of 12 months. Bio NPK has been validated for its yield contributing attributes for cereals, millets, pulses, vegetables, fibre and oilseed crops. The formulation was found well suited for soils with pH in the range of 6.5 to 8.5. The formulation can help augment 25-30 kg N, 20-25 kg P2O5 and 10- 15 kg K/ha resulting in a net saving of about ` 2,500/ ha. The yield increase through application of consortium was 5-30% in rice, 10-12% in wheat and 57% in maize. The technology has been validated in 22 centres of AICRP-Maize, IGFRI, Jhansi, KVK, Mau, ICAR- NBAIM, farmer’s field on wheat, rice etc. The formulation has been licensed to M/S Arihant Naturecrop Pvt Ltd, Patna. Development of biopriming technology for rice: An effective biopriming technology was developed for coating rice seeds with a cyanobacterial consortia containing Plectonema sp., Anabaena sp., Nostoc sp. in equal proportion. Rice cultivars (PR 118, PR 113, MTU 1010, MTU 7029, HUR 105, PB 1, PB 115 and BPT 5204) coated with individual and composite cultures of cyanobacteria (5g, moisture content 20±2%; CFU 1.6×106), dried for 24 hr and grown in field showed enhanced germination percentage (10-16%) and primed plants showed increase in root length (5- Culture of king oyster mushroom Control; ½ RDF RD of NPK fertilizers 1/2 RDF+ Bio NPK CROP MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 59 9%), shoot length (12-17%) and seed vigour compared to non-primed plants. Increase in agronomic parameters was recorded in bio-primed plants and the yield was enhanced by 5-9% in primed plants than non-primed plants in different varieties and remained viable for about a year. Microbial formulation for drought alleviation: Microbial formulations of BioNPK + Archaea helped alleviate water stress in wheat under field conditions. Wheat grown under non-irrigated condition, resulted in 90% yield reduction while crops with one irrigation resulted in 85% yield reduction. Application of BioNPK + Archaea could supplement 8% yield loss where no irrigation was given while with one irrigation, the microbial treatment could supplement 26% of the yield loss. This microbial technology showed excellent potential to combat water stress and is currently under validation. Identification of host plant resistance traits for maize germplasm against the cob borer: Husk extension from the tip of the cob and husk tightness emerged as promising host resistance factors, against H. armigera. Screening of thirteen sweet corn hybrids showed that these two traits exhibited significant negative correlation of -0.84 (P=<.0001) and -0.69 (P=0.
