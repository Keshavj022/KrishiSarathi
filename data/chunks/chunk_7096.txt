 In shiitake mushroom, DMRO 327 strain was recommended for release for commercial cultivation. In addition, a hybrid shiitake mushroom with 51.16% biological efficiency from two flushes was developed. K 6. Livestock Improvement Cattle AICRP on cattle improvement: Under the Indigenous Breeds Project (IBP), 6,500 Kankrej and 7,219 Gir cows were registered in their native tract. During the period, 4 sets in Gir (33 bulls), Kankrej (35 bulls), and Sahiwal (35 bulls) were introduced, of which the first set of 22 bulls (6 Gir, 8 Kankrej, and 8 Sahiwal) were evaluated for their genetic merit. In comparison to the baseline information, 36, 24, and 20% improvement in daughter’s milk yield in the first set was achieved in Gir, Sahiwal, and Kankrej breeds of cattle, respectively. The average 305 days milk yield of elite cows maintained at germplasm (GP) units was recorded as 3,382.31±56.29 kg in Kankrej, 3,619.91±62.42 kg in Gir and 3,161.70±56.29 kg in Sahiwal which covers almost 50% of elite females maintained in the herd. A total of 769,049 semen doses of Gir (271,268), Kankrej (243,400) and Sahiwal (254,381) breeds have been frozen since inception. A total of 10,662 daughters (Gir 6,359), Kankrej (3,199) and Sahiwal (1,104) have been born in four sets since inception. Field progeny testing programme: Under the programme of crossbred Frieswal (Holstien Friesan × Sahiwal), 25,323 artificial inseminations (AIs) were done, of which 4,140 female progenies were born; 1,209 daughters reached the age at first calving, of which 1,080 completed their first lactation milk yield. The average first lactation 305 days milk yield of the FrieswalTM progenies increased by 60.35% in KVASU (1,958.4 kg to 3,140.43 kg), 42.86% in GADVASU (2,697.8 kg to 3,854.3 kg), 10.9% in BAIF (2,930.4 kg to 3,250 kg), and 41.64% in GBPUA&T (2,494.8 kg to 3,533.7 kg) centres covered field areas. A total of 57,879 frozen semen doses of FrieswalTM bulls have been maintained at the Frieswal germplasm unit (male) and 48,704 doses were made available to progeny testing program, various developmental agencies, para-vets and farmers for cattle improvement. Sheep At the farm, in Avishaan flock, ewe productivity efficiency (EPE) was 4.22 and 22.90 kg at birth and 3 month of age, respectively. The prolificacy in Avishaan ewes was 66.34% with litter size of 1.69. The average daily milk yield in ewes during the autumn lambing was 784 g. Since last three years, lambs born were 100% FecB gene carrier suggesting segregation of FecB gene in the progenies as a major gene. In field, 58 lambs were born out of 31 lambing of Avishaan ewes with a prolificacy of 71% and litter size of 1.87.
