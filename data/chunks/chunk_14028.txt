 However, the organic farming movement in India is still more of a niche than a widespread practice, with only a small percentage of farmers registered for organic farming. The potential for organic agriculture in India is immense, but it requires more research and information on the economics of producing and marketing organic products, particularly in comparison to inorganic farming. This gap in research is crucial to address as it could provide the necessary data to encourage more farmers to adopt organic practices and help India establish itself as a leader in sustainable agriculture on the global stage. To address this gap, the present study aims to estimate the profitability of organic agriculture in India through a meta-analysis, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the economic viability of organic farming compared to inorganic methods (Seshia Galvin 2021, Shweta et al. 2023) [15, 16]. Materials and methods Location and classification of studies from the literature: The meta-analysis focused on identifying and analysing studies on the profitability of organic agriculture in India, covering both published and unpublished sources to minimize publication bias (Challinor et al. 2014) [6]. The search spanned from 2008 to 2021, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. A systematic review was conducted using targeted keywords and Boolean operators, yielding 50 relevant studies—36 from Google Scholar and 14 from Krishikosh. The selected studies included peer-reviewed publications, conference proceedings, and thesis data, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of the profitability of organic farming in comparison to inorganic methods (Amenumey et al. 2009) [1]. Table 1: Source wise studies located for the study Name of source Number of studies selected Google Scholar 36 Krishi kosha thesis 14 Total 50 Analytical and Exploratory Meta-Analysis Analytical meta-analysis aims to estimate key metrics and summarize data quantitatively, providing a clear overview of results (Durgesh Yadav 2017) [8]. In contrast, exploratory meta-analysis investigates sources of variability among studies, seeking to identify factors that might affect results, such as study design or demographic differences (Djokoto et al. 2016) [7]. Selection Criteria of Studies To ensure quality and relevance, studies were selected based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria (Ghagare and Deshmukh 2019) [11]. Inclusion criteria required studies to provide separate net returns for both organic and inorganic farming and have sample sizes available. Studies were excluded if they were conducted outside India or did not involve agricultural crops (Bisoyi et al. 2003) [3]. Initially, 50 articles were reviewed, and after applying the criteria, 27 studies were selected for meta-analysis—23 from Google Scholar and 4 from Krishikosh theses, as detailed in Table 2.
