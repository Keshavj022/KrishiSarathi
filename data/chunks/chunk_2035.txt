Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report 7. Conclusion In the future, deploying and upgrading the integration of Infrared Thermography (IRT) and the Internet of Things (loT) for mastitis detection in dairy cattle will involve advancements in sensor technologies, loT infrastructure, data analytics, and integration with management systems. Efforts will focus on enhancing remote monitoring, automation and ensuring cost-effectiveness and accessibility for farmers. Continued research and validation will refine these systems, ensuring their effectiveness and reliability under various farm conditions. This holistic approach aims to improve the dairy industry's animal health, welfare, and productivity. 8. Links for supporting material e Bansal, B. K., Gupta, D. K., 2009.
