 Public expenditure in agriculture and rural development A gradual rise in the public sector expenditures in agriculture and rural development have helped for the transition. The public expenditure (at 2011-12 prices) has increased gradually from 1991 to 2005 but has risen more rapidly afterwards (Fig. 3). It was less than a lakh crore in the early 1990s but stands at around four lakh crores at present, rising around 4 times within a short span. Even in a relative term, measured as a share to total expenditures incurred by the public sector, the share of agriculture, including rural development, has begun to rise in recent years as a shift in the earlier trend. The growth in expenditure has risen in agriculture from 3.4% in the 1990s to more than 14% in the 2010s, and in irrigation expenditure, these shares have been 3.9% and 11.5%, respectively. The expenditures on development like roads and infrastructure have also risen substantially in the rural regions, helping for higher agricultural growth and sustainability.

Impact on food production The immediate impact of scientific developments and investment is reflected through the increase in food production to fulfill rising demand. The estimates show that growth in food production (at the aggregate level1) in the country has remained higher than the growth in the population. Consequently, the per capita food production in the country has increased from just 0.94 kg/day in 1950-51 to 2.65 kg/day in 2019-20 (Fig. 4). Notwithstanding, during the recent years (2001-02 to 2019-20), growth in population has decelerated which has further provided a fillip to the growth in per capita food production in India. The present level of food production is sufficient to sustain food security in the country (NITI Aayog 2018). The production growth is primarily led by improvement in productivity. Chand and Srivastava (2018) have decomposed growth in production of crop groups into area effects, yield effects, and interaction effects of area and yield during 2004-05 to 2014-15, and found that 92%, 76%, and 67% of the growth in production of cereals, pulses and oilseeds were attributed to increase in yield. Thus, an increase in yield has emerged as a major contributor to food production in the country. Fig. 4.

Credit demands, informal finance, and the rise of formal financial institutions Credit institutions and their supportive policies over years have played a pivotal role in the present state of developments in agriculture.
