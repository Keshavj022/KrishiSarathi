 Therefore, to quantify the CO2 emissions due to anthropogenic activities, we have analysed the ODIAC (Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide) CO2 data over India from 2009 to 2019 (Fig. 5). Note that this inventory is based only on the anthropogenic CO2. The ODIAC CO2 emissions show a consistent increase between 2009 and 2019 throughout India; confirming that anthropogenic activities are one of the key drivers of the increase in atmospheric CO2 from 2009 to 2020 in India. Additionally, the land-use changes may directly influence the global carbon 10 A. Singh, K. Abbhishek, J. Kuttippurath et al. Environmental Technology & Innovation 27 (2022) 102498 Fig. 6. The GOSAT CO2 trends estimated from measurements of seasonal and annual average over India from 2009 to 2020 (yr = year). All the trends are statistically significant at 95% CI.

The correlation coefficient between atmospheric CO2 and its drivers over India. budget and trends in atmospheric CO2. After the industrialization in 1850, enhanced anthropogenic activities and changes in land-use patterns led to the degradation of soil and huge emission of CO2 into the atmosphere (Smith et al., 2007). The CO2 emissions from agriculture land use (ALU) in India increased from 2009 to 2017 (Figure S3). Furthermore, the trend analysis for the annual CO2 concentration shows a significant increase of about 2.42 ppm/year between 2009 and 2020 (Fig. 6). The CEI, IGP, HIL and North-West (NWI) regions show a significant increase of about 2.44, 2.43, 2.43 and 2.41 ppm/year, respectively, in their annual CO2 concentrations between 2009 and 2020. The consumption of petroleum products increased by about 4.7% CAGR (Compound annual growth rate) in India between 2010 and 2019 (Source: Indian petroleum & natural gas statistics 2019–20), which correlates with the rise in demand for tractors and power tillers for agricultural activities. The share of tractors in the total farm power has increased substantially as the sale of tractors and power tillers has increased about 6% (CAGR) over the period 2005–2017 (Source: State of Indian Agriculture 2017–18). There is a significant increase in CO2 emissions from different sectors of India in 2009–2018, as observed in EDGAR analyses (Table S2). Approximately 65% increase in CO2 emissions from the transport sector in India between 2009 and 2018. Additionally, India ranks second in the world for coal consumption. There is a continuous increase in coal consumption between 2008 and 2017, and can be attributed to the increased dependence of 11 A. Singh, K. Abbhishek, J. Kuttippurath et al.
