Evolution of Higher Agricultural Education (HAE) in India Higher education in agriculture was not much in demand before independence. In 1876, the Madras Veterinary College was started in Chennai to offer diploma and certificate course in veterinary and animal sciences. Later in 1903 it attained the status of a college and got affiliated to University of Madras in 1936. The first ever structured attempt by British Government for higher agricultural education was made during 1901-1905 when 6 agricultural colleges were established at Coimbatore, Kanpur, Layallpur (now in Pakistan), Nagpur, Pune and Sabour. In 1927, Bihar & Orissa Veterinary College was established having the distinction of being the 5th oldest veterinary college of undivided India. The college started functioning from 7 April 1927 and became fully operational in 1930 and was known for its research in various branches of veterinary medicine and disease control. In 1948, only 17 agricultural colleges (13 Agriculture, 3 Veterinary and 1 Agricultural Engineering) existed in India with facilities for training of only 160 postgraduate research students (Randhawa 1986).
