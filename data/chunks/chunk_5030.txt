Experiment The experiment was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of mora for grain storage as compared to other methods in 10 replications with five treatments, viz., T1_Control (Bamboo basket), T2_mora, T3_Metal bins, T4_Plastic bag and T5_Gunny bag. In each treatment 50 kg paddy seed was stored for a period of three months. Observations were recorded on germination of seeds after 3 months of storage. RESULT AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Data presented in Table 1 show that mora was considered a convenient and effective method of grain or seed storage, followed by the storage in metal bin. Other practices, namely, storing the seeds in gunny bag, plastic bag and earthen pot/pitcher were less effective. Experiment Results presented in Table 2 and 3 indicate that germination percentage of paddy seeds after 3 months of storage varied from 92.7 to 96.5. Germination percentage of stored grain in mora was 93.8. CONCLUSION No apparent difference has been observed for germination percentage of rice after 3 months of storage among the categories. It indicates that the indigenous practice of grain/seed storage in mora is an effective and efficient method.  GRAIN/SEED STORAGE Code : 1151 Title of the ITK : To protect pulses (greengram, blackgram, gram etc.) from storage pests Description of the ITK : Mustard oil and sesame (til) oil repel the insects. A little quantity of mustard oil or til oil is mixed with pulse grains while storing. This protects the pulses from storage pests. This costs Rs 10_15 per quintal pulse grain. This practice is adopted in Razzi Sarai village of Etah district in Uttar Pradesh. Name and address of the discloser : Shri Prem Pal Singh C/o Shri Dal Chand House No. 38, Purva Ahiran, Indira Chowk, Meerut (Uttar Pradesh) Location of use of the ITK : The ITK is being followed for protecting pulse grains both splitted one as well as the whole, from various storage pests. The ITK is reported from Razzi Sarai village of Etah district in Uttar Pradesh and was reported to be in use in the villages of Etah and Badaun district of Uttar Pradesh. The villagers generally keep the pulses in earthen pots and also in plastic pots with closed lid. Still in 50 to 60 per cent cases, the pulses are damaged by storage pests. Mustard or til oil have the antiseptic and stringent effect which might be helping in protecting pulses from pests.
