 Characters on which data should be recorded at the final stage of testing (AVT-II) (i) Same as in the IVT and AVT-1 above (ii) Agronomy: Fertilizer response (iii) Physiological parameters required only for trait-specific varieties (iv) Tolerance to abiotic stresses — flood tolerance, water stress tolerance (v) Processing quality 5. Plot size, spacing and number of replications (i) IVT —5 rows of 3m length, 6 replications (ii) AVT—20 rows of 4m length, 4 replications (iii) Row-to-row distance: 25 cm for olitorius and 30 cm for capsularis (iv) Plant-to-plant distance: 5-7cm 66 GUIDELINES FOR TESTING CROP VARIETIES UNDER AICCIPS 6. Agroclimatic zones Presently varieties are being released for all jute and mesta growing tracts of the country. 7. Description of morphological features DUS testing guidelines notified by the PPV&FRA may be followed wherever available. Minimum traits required for distinctness, uniformity and stability of a variety may be decided by the workshop (Annexure-V). 8. Others Information on the available DNA markers (based on the availability) is also to be recorded. Forage Crops 1. Important characters on which data should be recorded A. Yield (i) Green forage yield (kg/ha) (ii) Dry matter yield (kg/ha) (iii) Per day productivity (kg/day/ha) B. Forage yield component (i) Plant height (cm) (ii) No. of branches/tillers/plant (iii) Fast growth, regeneration ability i.e. no. of cuts within a specified period (for multi-cut crops) C. Agronomic features (i) Leaf-stem ratio (ii) Days to 50% flowering (iii) Days to maturity (for seed) D. Physiological characteristics (i) Plant type (spreading/semi-spreading/erect) (ii) Canopy size (width) (iii) Tolerance to abiotic stresses: Temperature, soil moisture, salinity, waterlogging and acidity E.
