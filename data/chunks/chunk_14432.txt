 Interestingly, the non-IGP states showed a 37 % decrease in ABA from 2011 to 2015 but showed an exponential increase after that, resulting in a 245 % increase until 2020. Punjab is responsible for 48 % (1.40 million ha) of total ABA, followed by Madhya Pradesh, contrib­ uting 17 % (0.50 million ha) in 2011, which changed to 41 % (2.0 million ha) and 30 % (1.40 million ha), respectively in 2020. Fig. 3 shows the decadal trends of ABA for five seasons for respective states showing significant changes. 4.2. Spatio-temporal trends in DMB from 2011 to 2020 Determining the amount of agricultural DMB is necessary to comprehend and characterize crop-based burning tendencies. Fig. 2(b) gives an overview of the spatial distribution of DMB (in tonnes) across the study districts in India. Estimates of DMB are influenced by the area under cultivation, crop-residue production and the measure of burning, which in our case is ABA. Despite being the third largest contributor of residue generation among the seven crops, sugarcane accounted for only 1 % (0.20 Mt) of total DMB in 2020. Rice crops accounted for 56 % of the total DMB in 2011, which decreased to 49 % in 2020. However, wheat crops contribution to total DMB showed an increase of 5 %, from around 3.82 Mt in 2011 to 7.72 Mt in 2020. Maize has been the third-largest contributor to DMB, with its contribution almost doubling from 4 % (0.30 Mt) in 2011 to 8 % (1.60 Mt) in 2020. It is important to note that Fig. 3. Agricultural burned area (ABA) (ha) estimated for burning seasons (a) Summer, (b) Autumn, (c) Winter, (d) Rabi, and (e) Kharif showing a decadal trend for the top contributing states. (f) Top contributors are depicting % of ABA out of the total area under cultivation. A common legend is used for all plots showing the top states per season. M.V. Deshpande et al. Science of the Total Environment 904 (2023) 166944 8 despite having the highest crop-to-residue ratio, cotton and jute did not account for much in the burning of dry matter. Despite an 18 % increase in production, cotton showed a significant decrease in DMB after 2013, dropping from 0.33 Mt in 2013 to 0.16 Mt in 2020. As a result, its contribution to DMB reduced from 3 % in 2011 to 1 % in 2020. The seasonal trends and spatial contributions of DMB shown in Fig. 4 highlight the notable contribution of DMB from non-IGP states, including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Mahara­ shtra. In particular, contributions for burned dry matter from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have grown exponentially after 2015, with an increase of 460 % and 700 % in 2020, respectively. In the case of the IGP, Punjab alone is responsible for 73 % (5.80 Mt) of the total DMB from the IGP in 2011, which increased slightly to 77 % (8.50 Mt) in 2020. Interestingly, Haryana showed a decrease in the burning of dry matter after 2018, resulting in a 52 % reduction until 2020. A similar trend is observed in ABA over Haryana for 2018–2020. 4.3.
