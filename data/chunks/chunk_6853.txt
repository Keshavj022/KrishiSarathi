Land suitability maps of turmeric in Kerala for 2020 and 2050 Area-speciﬁc adaptation strategies for rainfed maize under future climates of India: Spatio-temporal changes in maize yield under projected climate change were studied using multi-model ensemble climate (a) (b) icar annual report 2022-23 141 change projection derived from 30 general circulation models in 16 major maize growing districts of India. DSSAT model was used to simulate maize yield and evaluate adaptation strategies during mid (2040-69) and end-centuries (2070-99) under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 and identiﬁed the potential adaptation measures to reduce the negative impact. Genetic coefﬁcients were calibrated and validated for each of the study locations. The projected climate indicated a substantial increase in mean seasonal maximum (0.9–6.0°C) and minimum temperatures (1.1–6.1°C) in the future (the range denotes the lowest and highest change during all the four future scenarios). Without adaptation strategies, climate change will reduce maize yield in the range of 16% (Tumkur) to 46% (Jalandhar) under RCP 4.5 and 21% (Tumkur) to 80% (Jalandhar) under RCP 8.5. Only at Dharwad, the yield could remain slightly higher or the same compared to the baseline period (1980–2009). It was found that a combination of individual adaptation strategies (increased fertilizer dose, supplemental irrigation, and delayed sowing time) might reduce the magnitude of yield reduction in many study locations and even expected to increase by 5, 13 and 15%, respectively during mid-century under RCP 4.5 scenario in Guntur, Tumkur and Rangareddy districts, respectively. Climate change impact on weeds and herbicide efficacy: Study was initiated to assess the crop-weed interaction and herbicide efficacy under changing climate scenario using FACE facility at ICAR-DWR, Jabalpur. Growth and biomass of two major weeds, viz. Echinochloa colona and Altemanthera paronychioides in rice increased and the efficacy of herbicides, viz. bispyribac sodium against E. colona and 2,4-D against A. paronychioides was significantly reduced under elevated CO2. Similarly, in wheat, the bioefficacy of carfentrazone-ethyl against Chenopodium album and Rumex dentatus was reduced under elevated CO2 (550±50 ppm) and higher temperature (ambient + 2°C) in comparison to ambient levels. Under such a situation, higher dose (2×) of herbicide was required to control the weeds.
