Chemical Engineering Journal Advances 16 (2023) 100547 4 where Wi is the relative weight; Rn is the rank of each parameter; and n is the number of parameters After assigning calculated relative weight (Wi), a quality ranking scale (Qi) was assigned for each parameter by dividing its concentration in each water sample based on its standard (BIS, WHO, NEMA) and then the result is multiplied by 100: Qi = Ci Si × 100 (2) where Qi is the quality rating; Ci is the concentration of each chemical parameters in water sample; Si is the drinking water standard for the mentioned parameters. The next step is to determine sub-Index (Si) of each chemical parameters of water samples by using the following equation: Sli = Wi × Qi (3) where sli is the sub index of ith Parameter, Wi is the relative weight of ith Parameter Finally, the WQI was obtained by following equation: WQI = ∑ Sli (4) After calculating WQI, the values were allocated into five classes ranging from excellent to unsuitable for drinking. 2.6. Water quality assessment for irrigation The sodium content (Na%) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), which are calculated using Eqs. (5) and (6) [40], are frequently utilized to identify as to if underwater can be utilized for irrigation purposes. The ionic units for the assessment of SAR and Na% are in mEq/L−1. SAR = Na+ ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ Ca2++Mg2+ 2 √ (5) Na% = Na+ Na+ + K+ + Ca2+ + Mg2+ × 100 (6) 2.7. Kriging interpolation for spatial mapping Spline, Inverse Distance Weighting and Kriging are some of the interpolation techniques employed for spatial mapping. With the help of ArcGIS, the Kriging technique was utilized in this study to assess its functional efficiency of the data. 2.8. Accuracy assessment The charge balance error (CBE) was carried out for the data quality assurance. where, units are in meq.L−1 was utilized using Eq.
