 Regular monitoring of pond ecology and water quality revealed its moderate natural productivity (GPP: 340-425 mg C/m3/h and NPP: 150-350 mg C/m3/h), high DO (8.8 to 14.2mg/l), low BOD (< 30 ppm) and normal pH (7.2).In such condition, fish growth was recorded in the range of 200- 300g, from an initial 5.0g, over 3.5 months of culture and with 80% survival. The pond was harvested with an exceptional fish catch of about 580 kg in 3.5 months (equivalent to 4 tons/ ha/ 9 months). Noteworthy feature of this intervention was that this could be achieved through just 115 kg of supplementary feed, which is below 50% of the normal feed requirement. It was further observed that the heavy metals (viz. Cu: 0.09-0.14 ppm, Fe: 0.97-1.1 ppm;Mn: 0.13-0.17 ppm; Zn: 0.54-0.68 ppm; Ni: 0.38-0.42 ppm; Pb: 0.10-0.44 ppm) as recorded from fish muscle (Table 5) were completely within their safe limits, from the point of view of both fish growth and consumer health.

Emergy analysis of the developed technology solution (Table 6) showed that the renewable resources constituted 54.24% of the total emergy use, with the other half (i.e. 45.76%) contributed by the purchased non-renewable resources such as construction, electricity and maintenance. In the renewable (i.e. local + purchased) resource category, the local (i.e. free) renewable resources contributed the maximum (77.69%) emergy. Purchased renewable resources such as the media and the vegetation, which require service to access constituted only 12% of the total emergy use and were thus the minor component of the total system emergy use. Amongst the purchased non-renewable resource category, the labour-intensive purchased services such as the construction (63.26%) and the annual maintenance (36.47%) contributed the maximum while the electricity, used primarily for pumping out of treated wastewaters, contributed the minimum (0.27%).
