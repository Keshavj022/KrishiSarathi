 TOBACCO Crop Improvement A Natu tobacco variety Pyruvithanam has been released by the SVRC, Orissa, for cultivation in pikka-tobacco growing areas of Orissa. This variety has yield potential of 1,250 kg/ha. And a chewing tobacco variety Lichchavi has been released for cultivation in the north Bihar. Beauveria bassiana, a biogent. This fungus has been isolated from the mesta-flea beetle Nisotra orbiculata and has proved active for controlling insect-pests of jute and mesta Advanced breeding lines Cy 135, Cy 136, Cy 137 and Cy 139 performed well in bulk observation trials, yielding 2,250 to 2,450 kg of cured leaf/ha; an increase of 24 to 36% (1,240 to 1,590 kg/ha), and 37 to 53% increase in bright leaf over the check in the northern black soils. Intersectional hybrids of cross Nicotiana repanda × N. tabacum have been Tobacco varieties recommended for identification Variety Yield potential Recommended for identification (kg/ha) Hemadri 2,500 FCV tobacco for traditional black soils in rainfed areas of Andhra Pradesh Bhairavi (NG 73) 2,600 Natu tobacco for rainfed areas of Andhra Pradesh BSRB 2 (Sweta) 2,000 Burley tobacco for light soils of Agency area in Andhra Pradesh under monsoonic conditions l Produced intersectional hybrids of Nicotiana repanda × N. tabacum from hormonal-aided direct hybridization. l Helicoverpa armigera damage to FCV tobacco was more when high N was applied, but K reduced its incidence and damage. CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 45 Burley tobacco variety Sweta has been recommended for identification for light soils of Andhra Pradesh in monsoonic conditions. It has a yield potential of 2,000 kg/ha FCV tobacco variety Hemadri has been recommended for identification for traditional black soils in rainfed areas of Andhra Pradesh. It has showed a yield potential of 2,500 kg/ha produced from hormonal-aided direct hybridization. The hybrid is very important because ovule-parent is reported to be resistant to eleven diseases and two insect pests of tobacco. Crop Production Nitrogen at 120 kg/ha to Banket A1 variety of burley tobacco of light soil in organic (FYM) and inorganic forms in 25 : 75 ratio recorded 18.4% more leaf yield to normal practice. This variety recorded maximum cured leaf yield of 2,062 kg at 120 kg N/ha along with 10 tonnes FYM. High-grade phosphate rock of Jhamarkotra mines (Rajasthan) with 34% total P2O5 and 74 micron size (PR 34/74) was found promising for FCV tobacco on neutral soils, low in available P. PR (34/74) at 80 kg P2O5/ha in combination with FYM at 3.5 tonnes/ha or PR at 90 kg P2O5/ha along with green manuring can be profitably used for the southern light-soil crop, replacing SSP and diammonium phosphate. Cowhage, Aswagandha or Coleus, medicinal plants, are promising alternatives to FCV tobacco, and they may be considered for soils unsuitable for quality tobacco production.
