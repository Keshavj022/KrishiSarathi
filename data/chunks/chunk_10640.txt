 The color based method for detection of detergent in milk; spore based kit for detection of antibiotic residue, paper strip assay for rapid detection of pesticide residues in milk and other food matrices; and PCR based test for A1 and A2 types of milk and milk products have also been developed. The COWCAM kit developed for detecting cow milk adulteration in camel milk and vice versa. The PCR-RFLP based technique for identifying Cloning of cloned bull Hisar Gaurav DARE-ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2014-2021 30 genetic disease such as Bovine Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (BLAD) and LAMP Assay based rapid detection of cow components in buffalo milk/meat were also developed. F. Fishery Technologies for Blue Revolution To augment the fish production and raise the income of the fish growers in the country, fish breeding and seed production technologies were developed for 25 species of food fishes during 2014-21 as compared to 16 species during 2007-14. Further, in case of ornamental fishes, the number increased from 13 species during 2007-14 to 48 species during 2014-21. The diversification in aquaculture systems are taken on priority that led to designing and development of 27 improved/new aquaculture systems for finfish/shellfish culture during 2014-21 against 22 such systems during 2007-14. The diagnostic/analysis kits for disease diagnosis, water quality analysis and adulterants/contaminants in fish have Maze rabbit fish Mangrove snapper Yellowtail blue damsel Pseudanthias marcia Milk Fish Induced fish breeding & seed production DARE-ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2014-2021 31 been increased to 25 numbers during 2014- 21 as against 15 numbers during 2007-14. Out of the 25 diagnostic/analysis kits, 8 kits have been commercialized. The research for development of high- value compounds and nutraceuticals from seaweeds and marine organisms has been augmented during 2014-21. As a result, 49 high-value compounds and nutraceuticals from seaweeds and marine organisms were developed during 2014-21 compared to 37 in 2007-14. Out of 49 high-value compounds and nutraceuticals developed during 2014- 21, 26 have been commercialized through licensing to different companies. The fish feed formulations for various life stages play a critical role in augmenting the fish productivity. During, 2014-21, 25 indigenous fish feed for various life stages of diversified aquaculture species were developed against 15 such feed during 2007- 14. To augment the fishing activities including deep-sea fishing, 62 fishing crafts/ equipment/gadgets were designed for fisheries and aquaculture management during 2014-21 as compared to 55 in the previous seven years. During 2014-21, 41 value-added fish products and 6 commercial products from fish waste were developed as against 18 value-added fish products during 2007-14.
