 Singh and Gu (2010) also found an annual gross residue production potential of 1055 MT in India from various crops, including horticulture, cereals, pulses, spices, and plantation crops. Bhuvaneshwari et al. (2019) mentioned that 500 MT of agricultural residue is generated annually in India. Usmani (2020) estimated 230 MT of available biomass from mixed crops for energy generation. It should be noted that the variations in the RPR and SRF data in different sources are the reason behind the variation in crop residue availability data in India. Moreover, the time of documentation of the biomass resource data, the variation of data in different sources/agencies along with the errors related to transparency also effect the data estimation process. However, this study attempted to estimate the availability of crop residues based on a wide variety of major crops available in the country and considering government data sources. Fig. 4 shows state- wise mapping comparison of the gross residue potential and surplus syngas potential under the same scale (0–171.0 MT). 3.1.2. State-wise potential Among the 28 states and 8 UTs of India, the estimated crop residue potential (gross and surplus) data can vary significantly for 2017–18. Fig. 5 shows the variations in gross and surplus crop residue potential in the different regions of India. Concerning the gross crop residue potential, Uttar Pradesh, with 170.96 MT, is at the top, followed by Maharashtra (82.77 MT), Madhya Pradesh (78.94 MT), Punjab (60.26 MT), Karnataka (54.31 MT), Gujarat (51.44 MT), Rajasthan (49.39 MT) and so on. All the top states in the list are agriculturally advanced in India. Sugarcane has the highest contribution to the gross crop residue in Uttar Pradesh, followed by rice and wheat. These three crops together were found to contribute about 86.11% of the state’s total estimated gross crop residue. In terms of surplus crop residue potential, the highest con- tributor is Uttar Pradesh, with the maximum amount of 57.72 MT, followed by Maharashtra (30.86 MT), Madhya Pradesh (23.80 MT), Karnataka (19.53 MT), Gujarat (18.39 MT), Rajasthan (16.89 3779 T.J.
