Germplasm has elite genetic background (PR114) IC626285 22106 The germplasm is an EMS mutant of Nagina 22. It exhibits higher root biomass, number of tillers and grain yield than Nagina 22 under low phosphorus soil conditions. NH 787 shows higher photosynthetic rate, pollen fertility, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes are carried out in low phosphorus soil IC646829 22107 Highly tolerant to submergence. High anaerobic germination potential IC645856 22108 Tolerant to vegetative stage drought stress. Possess low transpiration rate and high water-use efficiency IC645857 22109 Tolerant to vegetative stage drought stress with low transpiration rate, high ROS scavenging activity and high WUE. Tolerant to submergence and salinity stress at vegetative stage IC645858 22110 Tolerant to vegetative stage drought stress with low stomatal density and high WUE GENETIC RESOURCES ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 54 Crop/Botanical name National Identity INGR No. Novel/Unique features IC352909 22111 Leaf and Neck and blast resistance IC647170 22112 Highly resistant to leaf and neck blast IC647171 22113 Highly resistant to leaf and neck blast IC647172 22114 Leaf and Neck and blast resistance IC647174 22115 Leaf and Neck and blast resistance IC128335 22116 Drought tolerance with higher antioxidant (1.8 fold) activity IC646830 22117 Highly resistant to wheat blast.
