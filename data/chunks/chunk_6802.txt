 Weed management in cowpea: Study at Hisar, Jorhat and Dharwad (zone III, VIII and VI) revealed that the maximum pod yield of 80.5 q/ha with B:C ratio of 2.2 was obtained with pre-emergence application of Pendimethalin @ 6ml/L+ one hand weeding 25 days after sowing. Grafting in solanaceous vegetables: In solanaceous vegetables, grafting was conducted using four rootstocks (three brinjal IC 354557, IC 111056, Surya and one tomato wild S. pimpinellifolium) and three tomato scion cultivars (Kashi Aman, Kashi Adarsh and Kashi Chayan). The yield of Kashi Aman and Kashi Adarsh was unaffected, whereas yield of Kashi Chayan decreased by 22.3% as compared to non-grafted tomato. Intercropping of coriander in bearing arecanut palms: Burmese coriander is a popular herb grown in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The herb was grown as an intercrop in bearing arecanut palms of variety Samrudhi to study the profitability of this herb as an intercrop in the warm humid tropical conditions of South Andaman Island. Results suggested that introduction of Burmese coriander in the interspaces could give higher net returns of 13,03,065 as against 9,59,600 in the arecanut sole crop. The B:C ratio of this treatment was 3.19 and hence, it could be recommended for the island farmers. Integrated Nutrient Management in tuber based cropping system: A field experiment on the effect of inorganic and organic manures on soil quality, yield and proximate composition of yam + sweet corn cropping system in an Alfisol of eastern India showed significantly highest tuber yield (25.16 t/ha) due to integrated application of FYM @ 16t/ha in combination with 40- 30-50 kg N, P2O5 and K2O/ha and MgSO4 @ 25 kg/ha at par with FYM + Â½ NPK + ZnSO4 (24.66 t/ha). The study indicated that integrated use of FYM along with half of the recommended doses of NPK fertilizers and MgSO4/ ZnSO4 not only enhanced the productivity of greater yam but also sustains the soil quality parameters. Application of customized fertilizers in sweet potato: Under fertilizer best management practices in sweet potato, application of customized fertilizers developed by ICAR-CTCRI @ 300 kg/ha as basal and Crop Management icar annual report 2022-23 104 one month after planting followed by foliar application of micronol sweet potato @ 5 ml/litre three times on 15, 30 and 45 days after planting was found to be the best for higher tuber yield (22.74 t/ha) compared to present POP (19.67 t/ha) and recorded 15.61% higher yield over control was recommended for eastern plateau and hills, lower gangetic plains, middle gangetic plains, southern plateau and hills, and Gujarat plains and hills. Standardization of nutrient requirement of swamp taro: Standardized the nutrient requirement of swamp taro (Kalyani, Jorhat, Imphal, Lembucherra and Thiruvananthapuram). Application of FYM 15 t/ha + N-P2O5-K2O 120-60-90 kg/ha recorded significantly higher stolon yield (25-30.14 t/ha i.e.
