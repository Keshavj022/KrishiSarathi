Agriculture is not a profession but a part of their life for people living in rural areas. Unquestionably, India’s main source of employment is in agriculture and related industries, particularly in the country’s vast rural areas. Agriculture has existed in India since the Neolithic era. India is second in the world for agricultural output. In 2021–22, agriculture contributed about 18.8 per cent of India’s GDP (gross domestic product) which is more than $400 billion. Additionally, it employs half of India’s population.
