 yy Breeding cycles and phenotyping for enhanced yield potential, heat and drought tolerance, resistance to Ug99 stem and other rusts done at three locations in Mexico (Cd. Obregon, Toluca and El Batan), two in Kenya (Njoro-off- and main-seasons) and India (IIWBR-Karnal & BISA-Ludhiana). The grain yield trial at Cd. Obregon, led to identification of more than 500 superior, new bread wheat lines. The mean grain yield of wheat lines tested in 2018-19 cohort increased by 6% compared to lines tested in 2013-14 cohort, indicating at least 1% annual genetic gain (Fig. 7). yy About 300 high yielding lines with heat and drought tolerance identified through multi- year field phenotyping at Cd. Obregon, Mexico under managed environments. yy Grain quality analysis for 1,330 elite lines, selected from 1st year yield trials identified lines with good quality characteristics including high protein content (Fig. 8). Fig. 6. Grain yield performance of 687 bread wheat entries under optimum irrigation (mean of three trials, Cd. Obregon 2017/18 & 2018/19) and included in various nurseries and trials in 2020 Fig. 7. Grain yield distribution for cohorts of 7672 wheat lines tested in 2013-14 season (baseline) and a new cohort of 9239 lines tested 5 years later in 2018-19 season at Ciudad Obregon, Mexico under optimally irrigated environment. ICAR-CGIAR | ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 47 yy Although yellow rust fungus continues to evolve and migrate rapidly around the globe, use of diverse resistance in breeding combined with phenotyping and selection in Mexico, Kenya and India is helping to identify superior yielding, resistant lines in all three continents in adequate frequency (Fig. 9). All best lines were shared with Indian collaborators in the crop season 2018-19 and 2019-20. Wheat Blast Research During 2019, two sets of Indian materials were evaluated - 1) 100 Indian elite germplasm (named as IND100) at Jashore in Bangladesh, and Quirusillas and Okinawa in Bolivia; and 2) a new panel containing 353 wheat lines from India (IND353) evaluated at Jashore, Bangladesh. In each location, the materials were planted in two sowing dates, to expose them to wider variation of environments; inoculations were carried out and misting provided to increase the chance of heavy WB infection. Blast screening for the 100 wheat lines from India Of 100 lines, 34 were 2NS while remaining 66 were of non-2NS. Several lines showed consistently good resistance to blast, most of which were of 2NS; but still a few non-2NS lines showed moderate level of resistance. Ever since the 2017-18 season in Jashore, a few non-2NS lines have exhibited good resistance, like HD 2204 (IND 26), PBW 773 (IND 73), WH 1218 (IND 92) and HI 1622 (IND 45); additionally, DBW 39 (IND 99) didnâ€™t show good resistance at first but later exhibited better resistance. Blast screening for the 2018 Indian 353 panel The 2018, Indian 353 panel showed a clear bimodal distribution.
