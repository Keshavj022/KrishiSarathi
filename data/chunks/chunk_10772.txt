   Construct Water Farm Pond or Plastic based water pond, this is the appropriate time, so that excessive rainwater during first monsoon rain can be collected and harvested and it can be used for life saving irrigation on different critical stages during deficit rainfall conditions. By harvesting of excessive rainwater during rainy season, field crops can be protected from water logging.   For sustainable farming prepare proper work plan for organic farming in next kharif season and for this nearby KVK may help you in providing proper advisory and guidance.   Adopt appropriate IFS Models as per availability of different resources, infrastructure, and facilities on their farm. Crop production and Management Cotton: Sowing Sowing can be done in between First week of May to Third week of May, as per irrigation water availability. Seed Rate & Spacing: Desi Cotton-15-16 kg/ha (60x25 Cm), American Cotton- 12-16 kg/ha (67.5x30 Cm) and in Bt Cotton-1.5 Kg/ha (108x60 Cm) Manure & Fertilizers: Apply 8-10 ton well decomposed FYM & it should be mixed properly in the soil before ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 33 sowing. Apply chemical fertilizers as per soil testing report, if soil testing report is not available than on an average apply 100-120 kg N in two to three split doses and 30-40 kg P at the time of sowing. Improved Varieties: Desi Cotton: RG-8, RG-18 American Cotton: RST-9, RS-2013, RS-810, H-8, DCH-32, Bikaneri Narma & Ganganagar Ageti etc. Bt Cotton: MRCH-6304, MRCH-6025, PCH-9605, RCH-314, RCH-134 etc. Plant protection:   To control leaf sucking pest & Leaf Curl Virus disease, seed should be treated with 4 g Thiomethaxom 70 WS/kg seed before sowing.   Keep close monitoring on White fly host plants like vegetables, flower plants, weeds & unwanted plants and from time to time these affected host plants must be uprooted & burn. Some vegetables like Ladies Finger, Brinjal, Tomato & Chilly also act as host plants for white fly, accordingly, as per need these must be sprayed with Thiomethaxom 25 WG @ 0.5g/litre water.   To control bacterial blight seed should be treated with soaking in 1 g Streptomycin or 10 g Plantomycin/10 litre water before sowing. Groundnut: Sowing: Sowing of groundnut can be done in the month of May under assured irrigation conditions. Improved Varieties: There are two type of varieties in Groundnut- Bunch type and spreading type. Spreading type varieties requires low seed rate and takes long time in maturity than bunch type varieties. For southern Rajasthan important varieties are Pratap Groundnut-1, Pratap Groundnut-3, TAG-24. In North Rajasthan mainly GJG-19, GG-20, GG-19 & HNG-69 are cultivated mostly. Bio-fortified Varieties: Girnar-4 & Girnar-5 (Rich in Oleic acid) Seed Rate: For Spreading Varieties-80-100 kg/ha (45x10 cm), for Bunch varieties-100-120 kg/ha (30x10 cm) Plant protection:   For Termite control seed should be treated with 4 ml Chloropyriphos 20 EC/ kg seed kernel before sowing.
