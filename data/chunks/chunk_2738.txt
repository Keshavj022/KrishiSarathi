Regeneration of shoots was carried out in selection medium containing kanamycin (100 mg/I) after co-cultivation of the explants with Agrobackrium tumefaciens (strain EHA 105). Rooting was accom- plished on a medium containing naphthaleneacerjc acid and kanamycin. Prog~ny obtain~d by s~lfing T. plants was grown in th~ gr~~nbouse and screened for the presence of neomycin phosphotransferase (nprIl), and crylAc genes by polymerase chain reaction (peR) and Southern hybridization. Expression of CrylAc in the leaves of the transgenic plants was detected by Xpress strips and quantified by Quan-T ELISA kits (DesiGen). Insect bioassays were performed with the larvae of collon bollworm (He/icoverpa armigera). Field tests of the most promising lines ff2 and T] gen- erations) were performed under contained conditions. Results of the field tests showed considerable potential of the transgenic cotton for resistance against cotton boUworm.
