Farming systems in Himachal are frequently threatened by floods, prolonged periods of droughts, pest outbreaks, hailstorms, low chilling in high hills and frost damage in the lower Shivalik Hills. Because of availability of food grains at cheaper rates in the public distribution system, and the aspirations of the youth for white collar jobs, crop damage by the stray cattle and wild animals, the people are giving up farming, as result, nearly 50% of the arable land is lying vacant, which is being increasingly infested by weeds. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop cost-effective alternative farming systems to attract the youth to farming to increase farmers’ income in Himachal Pradesh. There is an urgent need to: • Improve irrigation from 19 to cover >50% of the area under cultivation through check dams-tanks. • Integrate wheat/maize based cropping system with legumes and agro-forestry/ horticulture. • Timely availability of quality planting material of vegetables, flowers, fruits. • Adopt high/ ultra high-density planting of fruit crops to increase productivity. • Reduce post harvest losses, promote drying and value addition. • Diversification of farm income through crop-livestock farming, beekeeping, sericulture, fisheries, mushroom cultivation, agro-forestry, floriculture and aromatic and medicinal plants. • Adoption of protected cultivation, aquaponics and aeroponics. • Consolidation of land holdings: Define the minimum size of land holdings. • Cooperative/contract farming: Need of the hour. • Minimum support price: Buy back mechanism to reduce on-farm losses. • Farm mechanization: Technological support for reducing labour input. • Crop insurance: To mitigate the risk of climate change and crop failures.
