 Crop Improvement icar annual report 2022-23 49 Variety Area of adoption Salient features Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) Him Shakti Punjab, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odissa and Karnataka Suitable for irrigated, rabi season in plains, grain yield 14.7 q/ha, maturity 113 days, protein content 15.56%, oil content 9.26%, and first quinoa variety of the country. Asalio (Lepidium sativum) HLS 4 (Chandrasur) Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Western Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir Suitable for irrigated,/rainfed and normal sown conditions which give high seed yield, seed yield 14–15 q/ha, maturity 116 days, oil yield 3.07 q/ha, oil content 20.61%, resistant to diseases and insect-pests, narrow, imparipinnate, and unipinnate leaves. White clover (Trifolium repens) Him Palam White Clover 1 (PWC 25) Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand Suitable for pastures, grassland, wastelands and orchards of hill zones, sub- temperate and temperate climate, fodder yield 350–450 q/ha (green herbage in 3–4 cuttings), maturity 180–200 days (seed to seed), green-fodder contains 19–20% crude protein, very nutritive for grazing animals, tolerant to cold and frost, moderately resistant to powdery mildew, and no major insect-pest has been observed. Mapping of QTLs for yield, nutritional quality and stress tolerance Identification of QTLs for traits associated with drought tolerance: A novel QTL (Qlr.nhv-5D.2) on a 5D chromosome flanked by markers AX-94892575- AX-95124447 was IRC II Report 2021-22 11 identified for leaf rolling under moisture-stress condition in bread wheat. Two new candidate leaf rolling genes, viz. TaZHD1 and TaZHD10 belonging to homeodomain- leucine zipper (HD-Zip) class IV family proteins (gene) which are closest to orthologs of rice OsZHD1 and OsZHD10 were identified in the QTL region. Markers for C1-Inhibitor (C1-I) locus that interferes with R1-nj expression: Two C1-I specific breeder-friendly markers (MGU-CI-InDel8 and MGU-C1- SNP1) covering (i) 8 bp InDel and (ii) A to G SNP were developed. MGU-CI-InDel8 and MGU- C1-SNP1 markers predicted presence of C1-I allele with 92.9% and 84.7% accuracy, respectively. However, when both markers were considered together, they provided 100% accuracy GWAS for phosphorous uptake and utilization efficiency in mungbean: Mungbean (Vigna radiata) is an early maturing legume grown predominantly in Asia for its protein-rich seeds. The genetic dissection of PUpE (P uptake efficiency) and PUtE (P utilization efficiency) traits are essential for breeding mungbean varieties with a high P uptake and utilization efficiency. A genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) based genome- wide association study (GWAS) approach using 120 genotypes was employed to dissect the complexity of PUpE and PUtE traits at the genetic level in mungbean.
