 Ginger, turmeric, maize, and other crops are cultivated within alleys created by these shrubs. Height of alleys is typically maintained at ~1 m through regular pruning, and pruned biomass is either utilized as mulch or incorporated into soil to provide essential nutrients. Intercropping in spaces between hedgerows has proven to be a sustainable and effective technology for NEH region of the country.

Furthermore, it stands as the fifth essential input for enhancing yields and ensuring the quality of production in cross-pollinated agricultural and horticultural crops. The Northeast of India boasts abundant floral resources, diverse plant life and an exceptionally favourable climate for honey production. However, the region has yet to unlock its potential as a ‘honey capital’ in the country, primarily due to the lack of awareness, insufficient skilled labour, limited integration of beekeeping with agriculture, and an inadequate supply of bee colonies for commercial cultivation. In this region, honey is sourced from both wild and cultivated beehives, with an estimated 40,000 beekeepers. A majority of these beekeepers operate at a marginal scale, managing just one or two beehives. Despite the significant role that beekeeping plays in generating employment and sustaining livelihoods, its full potential remains untapped. A PICULTURE, or beekeeping, holds significant relevance in the Northeastern part of India due to its numerous benefits for the region’s ecology, economy, and livelihoods. The Northeast, comprising the states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, and Sikkim, is a region known for its rich biodiversity and varied agro-climatic conditions, making it an ideal place for beekeeping. Integration of beekeeping with agriculture will not only benefit the farmers with the direct benefits in the form of honey, bees wax, hive products and employment opportunities, but indirectly benefit greatly through increased crop production. Insect pollination is extremely important as only 5% of flowers are self-pollinated and 95% are cross-pollinated. Among 95%, 85% of pollination is brought about by insects. Evidently for increased crop production and sustainable agriculture, it is essential to explore the possibility of planned bee pollination.
