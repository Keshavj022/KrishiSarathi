 The increased agricultural productivity led to lower food prices; which was about one-half in South India and one-third in Bengal, in terms of silver, in the 18th century (Parthasarathi 2011). Farmers of Bengal learned techniques of mulberry cultivation and sericulture, establishing Bengal Subah as a major silk-producing region of the world (Richards 1995). During the second half of the 19th century, land under cultivation expanded at an average rate of about 1% per year. Due to extensive irrigation networks Punjab, Narmada valley and Andhra Pradesh became the centers of agrarian reforms. Indian Agriculture after Independence 66 Table 4. Milestones of soil science in pre-independent India Period Milestone 5000-2000 BC Vedas and Upanishads mentioned soil as synonymous with ‘the Mother’. Rig Veda has the earliest discussion on the importance of organic manure. 322-185 BC Mauryan Empire categorized soils. 1883 J.W. Leather started permanent manurial experiments at Kanpur and Coimbatore. 1906 J.W. Leather devised an indigenous method of characterizing Indian soils. 1920 N.V. Joshi started the first systematic research on the isolation and identification of Rhizobium in India. 1922 J.N. Mukherjee gave the concept of diffused double layer, neutralization of the charge of colloids and nature of soil acidity. 1930 S.L. Das developed the potassium carbonate extraction procedure for plant-avail- able P in calcareous soils. 1932 Madam Scholasky prepared the first Soil Map of India. 1933 Vaidyanathan summarized more than 5000 permanent manurial experiments. 1935 Indore composting for organic farming initiated by Albert Howard. 1935 A.N. Puri developed methods for measurement of exchangeable bases, lime and gypsum requirement. 1936 P.K. De first time discussed the role of cyanobacteria in soil fertility. 1940 C.N. Acharya developed biogas plant and methods of composting. 1942 R.N. Singh showed the role of blue green algae for supplying N in rice soils. 1943 Viswanath and Ukil at IARI prepared a Soil Map of India based on soil character- istics. 4.3. British era (1757-1947) 4.3.1. Soil resources and fertility In view of recurring famines and no breakthrough happening on application of the recommendations made by various Famine Commissions, the Imperial Establishment observed the need for seeking the help of one first class expert to make a general enquiry into the character of soils and agricultural conditions of the country. Accordingly, in 1889, J.A. Voelcker was appointed to advise upon the best course to be adopted to apply the principles of agricultural chemistry to induct improvements in Indian agriculture. This is regarded as the first serious endeavour to frame a policy of agricultural research having orientation to soils suiting Indian conditions. Appointment of J.W. Leather was an outcome of his recommendation to infuse a sound system of scientific investigation with agricultural chemistry as the central approach.
