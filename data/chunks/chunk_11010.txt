6 Tonne Paddy Straw Domestic Biogas Plant (PAU Model-I with RCC Digester Placed Below the Ground) Following are the basic information based on which the economic analysis PAU Model – I biogas plant was done: • Cost of installation of a batch type PAU Model – I biogas plant with RCC digester placed below the ground level is ` 1.80 lakhs • Total yielding life of plant is 20 years • Paddy straw holding capacity of the unit per batch of operation is 1.6 tonnes • Quantity of animal dung required per batch of operation is 0.4 tonnes • Each batch will produce biogas for a period of 3 months and in an year 3 such batches can be loaded and biogas can be produced for 9 months in a year. 13 Biogas Production from Paddy Straw at Domestic/Community Level Biogas produced per day is 3 m3/day or equivalent to 1.30 kg per day of LPG (at a specific density of 0.43 kg per m3) Cost of 1 kg of LPG is ` 56.34 (considering the commercial selling price of 1 cylinder of 14.2 kg of LPG is around ` 800). Table 2. Estimation of returns and costs when farmer invests 100% of the cost of the PAU Model-I biogas plant Sl. No. Cost Particulars Costs ` Per Year Price Realised A. Price realized (cost of LPG equivalent of biogas 19,775.00 produced at 1.3 kg per day at ` 56.34 per kg for a production span of 270 days per year) Operational Costs 1. Charges for crane for emptying the digested straw 6,000.00 (at ` 2,000 per batch for 3 batches) 2. Labour charges for straw/dung collecting/loading 3,750.00 etc. (@ 15 man days per year at a labour wage of ` 250 per day) B. Total Running Costs 9,750.00 Fixed Costs 1. Depreciation (assuming 20 years life and 8,100.00 10% scrap value) 2. Interest on capital investment 16,200.00 (assuming 100% capital is invested by the farmer) C. Total Fixed Costs 24,300.00 D. Total Costs (Operational + Fixed Costs) B+C 34,050.00 E. Net Loss to the farmer when he invests -14,275.00 100% of initial cost An analysis was done to determine the breakeven point for the farmer assuming various rates of subsidies on the initial cost of the PAU Model – I biogas plant. The following chart shows the rate of return and costs per year at various rates of subsidies: From the chart (Fig. 1) it is obvious that when the rate of subsidy is about 60% of the initial cost, the farmer will achieve the breakeven point for his investment on PAU Model – I biogas plant (meaning that the farmer need • • 14 Ex-situ Crop Residue Management Options not spend any money for installing and running the plant). In addition he gets the fuel for domestic cooking at free of cost. B. Economic Analysis of 1.6 Tonne Paddy Straw Domestic Biogas Plant (PAU Model-II with Mild Steel Digester Placed Above the Ground) Following are the basic information based on which the economic analysis PAU Model – I biogas plant was done: • Cost of installation of a batch type PAU Model – II biogas plant with RCC digester placed below the ground level is ` 2.10 lakhs • Total yielding life of plant is 20 years.
