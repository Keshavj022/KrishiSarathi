 Phenomics technology was used to identify germplasm and breeding lines with high water use efficiency and drought tolerance in the major food crops. Genotypes using significantly less water than that of Nagina 22 in rice and RILs of wheat superior to C 306 in WUE were identified. Total breeder seed production in field crops was 115,293.4 q against the indent of 83,690.1 q. The major share in total breeder seed production belonged to cereal crops, i.e. 61,976.6 q against indent of 36,814.1 q. In addition, quality seed including all classes was 468,610 q against the target of 388,137 q was also produced. For horticulture crops, 178.1 lakh planting material and 12.2 lakh tissue culture plantlets were produced against the targets of 193.5 and 5.1 lakh, respectively. During reported period, a total of 133 varieties of horticultural crops were notified and released for commercial cultivation; comprising varieties of vegetable crops (71), spices (14), seed spices (15), potato (5), tuber crops (18), fruit crops (6), and plantation crops (4). Arka Suprabhat mango, a double cross hybrid between Amrapali × Arka Anmol was developed. It bears in bunches with a fruit yield of 35–40 kg/tree. A promising coconut hybrid BGR × ADOT (Tall × Tall) with 81.4 nuts/palm/year yield was developed. Cocoa hybrids, viz. VTLCP 8 and VTLCP 9, with high yield potential, were found suitable for high density planting under arecanut and coconut plantation. Oil palm hybrids (Godavari Swarna, Godavari Ratna and Godavari Gold) with higher yield were identified. Arka Sharath, and Kashi Rajma French beans with parchment less pods and having high yield potential were developed. The genetically modified and biofortified banana cultivars Rasthali and Grand Naine with enhanced pro-vitamin- A were developed. The protocol for large scale micropropagation of Elakki Bale banana using embryogenic cell suspension was developed. SCAR (Sequence Characterized Amplified Region) molecular markers for identification of arecanut inter-specific hybrid were developed and validated. Whole genome of an androgenic potato dihaploid C-13 was sequenced with reference assembly. Overall, 30,241 genes were identified in C-13 genome, of which 15,538 genes were characterized by the GO terms. Livestock improvement: The indigenous cattle breed improvement program is being undertaken in Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal breeds. The average first lactation (305 days or less) milk yield at their germplasm (GP) units was 2,344.4 kg in Gir, 2,258.17 kg in Kankrej and 1651.62 in Sahiwal breed respectively. The progeny testing project envisages to test Frieswal (HF×Sahiwal) bulls under field conditions at four agro-climatic locations in India; and at all places, first lactation milk production showed an increasing trend over the years while the age at first calving recorded a decrease. The overall mean 300 days milk yield in crossbreed Frieswal was 3,335.82 kg.
