 Crops in semi-arid and arid areas do not need to be irrigated as much when they are grown on a permanent raised bed, which also lessens the negative effects of excess water on crop output. Crops are grown on raised beds using the crop establishment technique known as bed planting. The bed planter includes movable blades that may be used to create raised beds of various widths and heights by moving the blades on the frame and the roller on the back. The multi crop bed planter, which has an inclined seed metering mechanism, is used to sow seeds into raised beds. Prior to planting each succeeding crop, permanent raised beds with little reshaping of the furrows between the raised beds are required to save cultivation costs and improve system sustainability. Additionally, it regulates the movement of machines, restricting compaction to the furrow bottoms, enabling the use of lower seeding rates than with conventional planting techniques, and minimizing crop lodging.

Additionally, bed planting has numerous other advantages, such as the ability to mechanically control weeds, the ability to save irrigation water and reductions in lodging, sowing rate, and water logging. Permanent raised beds that retain stubble increase the possibility of direct drilling of all crops in the system, with accompanying advantages. For sugarcane, permanent beds provide crop flexibility, quick reaction to market opportunities, and intercropping. The size of the bed can range from 50 to 120 cm depending on the kind of soil and cropping strategy used. Each bed typically measures 67.5 cm from the middle of one to the middle of the bed next to it, with furrows that are 37.5 cm broad at their widest point. Furrow-irrigated permanent raised bed (PRB) planting systems have emerged as key elements of low-cost, sustainable agricultural systems. The beds are kept permanently and just slightly shaped during sowing. Crops can be sown on PRB in a single pass without any prior tillage, maximizing the potential of the PRB technology. The PRB plantersâ€™ inclined plate seed metering systems make it easier to apply fertilizer and seed at the appropriate locations in one operation, which improves crop stand, productivity, and resource efficiency. It permits the application of fertilizer even in standing wheat, direct-seeded rice, and maize crops. Bed shaper and two-disc furrow openers make up the PRB planter. In the presence of residues, the double disc planter sows two rows of wheat at 30 cm row spacing and one row of maize at a 20 cm seed-to-seed spacing in the middle of the bed.
