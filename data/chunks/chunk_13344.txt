Fig. 4: Improvement in Capacity Building of ICAR Employees since Creation of HRM Unit Based on 2 years√≠ mean data (2014-16), Crop Science Division deputed highest number of Scientists (341) and Technical staff (129) while highest number of Administrative staff was deputed by NRM Division (91) and SSS by Fisheries Science Division (97) for various capacity building programmes (Table 10). During the effective implementation phase (2016-18), Crop Science Division deputed the highest number of all the categories of staff i.e. Scientists (314), Technical (332), Administrative (211) and Skilled Support Staff (148). Overall, maximum average number of employees were trained in Crop Science Division (1005) followed by Horticulture Science Division (595), out of 3,871 employees trained in the ICAR system during 2016-18. 9.2 Per Cent Manpower Trained In terms of per cent employees trained under each category, 27.1% Scientific, 21.4% Technical, 26.7% Administrative including Finance and 12.6% Skilled Support Staff were trained in various aspects as per their training needs during 2016-18 (on average basis) with overall 21.7% employees across the categories got opportunity for capacity building.
