 Application of AI techniques for the CRA study: hydrometeorological parameters (a)–(h): (a) Pr, (b) Tmax, (c) Tmin, (d) DEF, (e) AET, (f) PET, (g) VPD and (h) RO trend (slope of the linear regression) map and ML model: (i)–(j): (i) RF and (j) XGB for the Onda block, Bankura district, West Bengal, India. S. Sahoo et al. Environmental and Sustainability Indicators 25 (2025) 100544 12 programs significantly enhanced their comprehension of climate- resilient, high-yielding varieties (HYVs) and drought, disease, pest tolerance, or short-term crop varieties (Dar et al., 2020a). Pandey et al. (2021) advocate for developing CRA methods tailored to policymakers’ demands and emphasize the necessity of diverse and effective social engagement. In regions like the Aravalli district, organic farming has been adopted to tackle pest adaptability, leveraging conventional pest management strategies (Angom et al., 2021). In Gujarat, organic farming has doubled farmers’ incomes without increased input costs (Kashyap et al., 2017). Strategic crop rotation boosts productivity, controls nutrient levels, and reduces crop failure risks (Mazhar et al., 2020). Technologies like mulching, waterland transformation, and zero tillage have improved soil health and productivity, particularly in semi-arid regions (PLP, 2018; Goswami et al., 2022). It is also worth noting that CRA practices often develop indepen- dently and without significant external funding, highlighting their po- tential to improve landholders’ livelihood strategies (Ahmad et al., 2022). The Indian government has also integrated CRA into its devel- opment policies and initiatives, including livestock management stra- tegies under climate change, micro-irrigation system planning, and renewable energy projects (Government of India (GOI), 2017; Patel et al., 2018). A flexible approach embracing Earth observation (EO) based data-driven practices and nature-based solutions is essential for achieving CRA targets in the future. Addressing the practical re- quirements for bridging the gap between observed and potential per- formance in agro-environmental policies is imperative. Indian agriculture has adapted to climate change through various methods, including soil organic carbon integration, in-situ moisture management, water-saving technologies, crop diversification strategies, improved livestock feeding, and recycling practices to reduce burning (Government of India (GOI), 2017; Patel et al., 2018). Social capital’s role in community development can also encourage financial in- stitutions to meet the credit needs of low-to moderate-income commu- nities. While India lacks a direct equivalent, grassroots initiatives can promote community involvement (Prince, 2024). These efforts engage residents in identifying their needs and priorities, leading to more relevant and effective programs.
