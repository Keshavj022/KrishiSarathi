 Shoot fly: Damage of the pest generally appears in the seedling stage upto six weeks old crop. The central shoot starts drying up and shows typical symptoms of ‘dead heart’. Early sowing can reduce shoot fly incidence. Seed treatment with Imidacloprid @ 10 ml/kg seeds or Thiamethoxam 70 WS @ 3 g/kg seed may be used. Harvesting and yield potential Harvesting should be done when the ear head colour starts fading or grains at lower portion of ear head matures. Normally, it is ready to harvest in 80-90 days after sowing. The separation of grains is usually done manually due to unavailability of thresher at present. Grain yield of 20-25 quintals under ideal condition may be obtained with green fodder of 40-50 quintal. SUMMARY Location specific improved varieties and agronomic practices can enhance the productivity and profitability of foxtail millet in Bihar. It is more suited in foxtail millet –mustard – greengram or foxtail millet – maize + potato – greengram cropping system due to its shorter lifecycle. Extension activities need to be focused like awareness programme and demonstration at the farmer’s field to disseminate the importance of foxtail millet. Furthermore, processing based interventions may promote the marketing of foxtail millet in Bihar which also gives better profitability in foxtail millet cultivation. *Corresponding author e-mail: bharati.upadhaya@rpcau.ac.in Table 1.

It has good adaptation to different soil and weather conditions. In case of grain sorghum, there are distinct types adapted to kharif (rainy) and rabi (post-rainy) seasons. The crop improvement efforts in grain sorghum starting from early 1960s has resulted in the release of nearly 80 high-yielding cultivars (hybrids as well as varieties) for cultivation across the country. Apart from these, a number of locally adapted high-yielding cultivars have been released through the research efforts at various AICRP on Sorghum centres spread across the states.
