 • On an average, its grain yield was 2,835 kg/ha, which was 10-40% higher than the yield of four checks — Pusa 23 (2028 kg/ha), ICMH 356 (2371 kg/ha), GHB 744 (2543 kg/ha) and RHB 121 (2576 kg/ha). • MPMH 17 also yielded higher stover (64q/ha) than Pusa 23 (52 q/ha), ICMH 356 (56 q/ha) and GHB 744 (63 q/ha), though its stover yield was slightly (1.5%) lesser than RHB 121 (65 q/ha). • The maturity duration of MPMH 17 and four checks was almost at a par (77-79 days). In spite of the same crop duration, considerable superiority of MPMH 17 over checks highlights that its growth rate and per day productivity is higher than checks. • Another distinctive advantage of MPMH 17 is its high level of resistance to downy mildew and blast; two most important diseases of pearl millet. Under artificially created epiphytotic conditions at 19 hot-spots during 2009-2011, MPMH 17 showed only 1.2% downy mildew incidence compared to 2-6% incidence on the checks. • Blast incidence in this hybrid was 9% compared to 10-15% of the four checks. • MPMH 17 responded favourably to additional doses of nitrogen. The yield improvement at 60 kg N/ha and 90 kg N/ha 802 was 12% and 20%, respectively, over basal dose of 30 kg N/ha during testing in the AICPMIP trials. • MPMH 17 matures, on an average, in 79 days and flowers in 48 days. It is high tillering (2.7 panicles/plant) and produces very compact panicles of 22-24 cm length, filled with medium- sized grains (seed weight of 8.0 g/1,000 grains) of globular shape and grey-brown colour. The hybrid attains height of approximately 180 cm and the panicle is, on an average, 2.6- cm thick. • Considering its grain and stover yields and disease resistance, MPMH 17 is proposed for identification in the rainfed conditions of kharif in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.
