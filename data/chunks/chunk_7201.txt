 were taken up to address various challenges of engaging youth in agriculture, brining self-sufficiency in production of pulses and oilseeds, sustainable agriculture, etc. Technology Assessment Technology assessment is among the core activities of KVKs, mainly for identifying the location specificity of agricultural technologies developed by National Agricultural Research System under various agro- ecological situations. The details of technologies assessed under different thematic areas of crops, livestock, enterprises and women empowerment are discussed below. Crops: The KVKs assessed a total of 5,222 technologies of various crops at 12,015 locations through implementation of 25,843 trails at farmersâ€™ field under different thematic areas, namely cropping systems; drudgery reduction; farm machineries; integrated crop management; integrated disease management; integrated nutrient management; integrated pest management; integrated weed management; processing and value addition; resource conservation; storage techniques; and assessment of newly released varieties of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, fruits, vegetable and commercial crops. Varietal evaluation was the major theme of technology assessment with 1,476 technologies assessed through 6,680 trials. Integrated nutrient management (787 technologies, 3,998 trials, 1,671 locations) and integrated pest management (766 technologies, 3,919 trials, 1,449 locations) were the other major thematic areas on which technology assessment was carried out. Livestock: A total of 873 technological interventions pertaining to different livestock were assessed by KVKs at 3,204 locations through 6,646 trials covering thematic areas such as animal disease management; evaluation of breeds; feed and fodder management; nutrition management; livestock production management; as well as processing and value addition. Nutrition management was the major thematic area with 220 technologies and 1,959 trials at 576 locations. All the major livestock species like cows, buffalo, sheep, goat, poultry, pig and fish were covered under the technology assessment. Other enterprises: KVKs tested 364 technologies at 1,222 locations through 2,247 trials under other enterprises including mechanization; processing and value-addition; drudgery reduction; small-scale income generation; nursery raising; fish production and management; and household food security. Mechanization was the major thematic area with 122 technologies assessed at 98 locations through 682 trials. Entrepreneurship development was the prime focus of all the technologies assessed. Women empowerment: As part of technology assessment, 299 technologies related to farm women were assessed through 2,077 trials at 579 locations. Health and nutrition (technologies 84, trials 513, locations 89) and drudgery reduction (technologies 67, trials 489, locations 58) were the major technologies assessed with an aim to promote women empowerment.
