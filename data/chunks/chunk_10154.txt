 Induced breeding of carp in controlled condition through hypophysation has been developed. Technology of composite fish culture achieved a five-fold increase in the national productivity of pond-culture carp from 0.6 t ha-1 yr-1 to 3.5 t ha-1 yr-1. Currently, India stands second in aquaculture production in the world. Detail achievements in fisheries and aquaculture sector are presented in Chapter 8. Table 4.
