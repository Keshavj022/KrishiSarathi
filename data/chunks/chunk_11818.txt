 yy It has about 80-85% lower capital expenditure demand than conventional wastewater treatment technologies and about 40-55% lower capital expenditure demand than other similar nature based solutions as it requires just R50 to 65 lakh for 1 Million liter /day (MLD) capacity facility in comparison to R4 Crore or more per 1-MLD for the conventional wastewater treatment technologies and R1.1 Crore or more per 1-MLD required for the similar the decentralized technologies, respectively. yy It has extremely low (i.e. maximum R0.60 per kiloliter, KL) operational expenditure (OPEX) demand in comparison to the conventional wastewater treatment technologies with R20 or more per KL of OPEX. yy The technology is capable of reducing turbidity and pathogen loads by 96 to 99.9%, BOD by 78 to 88%, heavy metals by 57 to 100% and nitrates/ phosphates by 30 to 57% at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) ranging from < 1 day to around 2 days. Hence, unlike the conventional technologies such as the Reedbed technology, with HRT of 5 or more days, the proposed technology is associated with significantly lower HRTs and lower land/ capital demands. yy Further the proposed technology solution is atleast 1500 times more sustainable and causes atleast 33 times lesser environmental stress than any conventional sewage treatment technology. Innovative Aspects Chapter 7 19 The technology has been recommended for its extension to 400+ Indian cities by MoUD and for national level adoption and implementation by the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture of the GoI. It has also been selected as a “Good practice example” under “Safe Use of Wastewater in Agriculture” initiative of the United Nations and as an innovation in Indian Agriculture by National Skills Foundation of India. Following representative public and private sector players, apart from those enlisted in chapter 6 and figure 4, have evinced a lot of interest in replication of the technology solution: yy Andaman Public Works Department, Port Blair yy Bedmutha Industries Ltd., Maharashtra yy Central Jail, Tihar, New Delhi yy Central Water Commission, MOWR-RD-GR yy Delhi Development Authority yy Delhi Jal Board yy Durgapur Steel Plant, Steel Authority of India Ltd., West Bengal yy Enviro Associates & Consultants, Sikkim yy EPCO, Bhopal Centre for Urban and Regional Excellence yy Faridabad Smart City Limited yy Horizon Research, Mathura Road, New Delhi yy HUDA, Gurgaon yy HUDA, Faridabad yy Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, New Delhi yy KRIBHCO, Noida yy Mapsets Engineering Services yy Ministry of Tourism, Art, Culture and Languages yy National Security Guards, Manesar Garrison, Gurgaon yy National Seeds Corporation Ltd.
