 South Parganas District   Nimpith KVK developed Land shaping and rain water harvesting technology for augmenting production per unit area by converting mono-cropped low lying areas into multi-cropped and assured irrigation throughout the year.   There is a scope for cultivation of sunflower and cotton.   Pisciculture is the major economical support of this district. Promotion in multiple cropping through paddy cum fish + vegetable in ails during kharif + vegetable in land embankment is recommended.   Diversification in vegetable farming through land embankment cultivation   Creation of upland in low-lying areas   Creation of vegetable cultivable areas through reclamation of saline soils   Distillation of derelict water bodies and proper utilization of water bodies through culture of air-breathing fish species.   Promotion of integrated fish cum duck cum vegetables cultivation is suggested.   Optimization of profitability by stocking at least 30 different freshwater fish species in carp ponds is advocated.   Triple cropping in a year through promotion of mono-sex tilapia and climbing perch farming in shallow water bodies is recommended.   Promotion of backyard hatcheries of high demand fish like carps, catfish, etc. to 655 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 enhance farmers’ income is promising option.   There is a prospect of culture of high value species like freshwater giant prawn, sea bass , feather back, indigenous catfish, butter fish, climbing perch, etc. in mono culture or poly-culture systems   Promotion of commercially profitable brackish water fish and prawn species like sea bass, mullets, shrimps, crabs etc is required.   Bee keeping may be promoted.   There is enough scope for goat and poultry farming in the district. 3. Zone VII: Eastern Plateau and Hill Region 3.1. Undulating Red and Laterite sub region 3.1.1. Bankura District   Intermittent gaps of precipitation and moisture stress during the monsoon gives rise to serious setback in production during the Kharif, which is the main stay of agriculture in the district.   Integration of adequate cropping system with inclusion of cereals, pulses, oilseeds and forage is suggested.   It is recommended to promote integration with horticultural crops like mango, guava, citrus, papaya with intercrop of vegetables like turmeric, ginger, chilli, elephant foot yam etc.   Plantation of different economically important minor fruit plants, such as bael, amla, custard apple etc and vegetable crops like drumstick, green papaya etc in wasteland should be undertaken.   Promotion of different Integrated Farming System modules such as: A. Crop based backyard poultry – goat rearing/ seasonal fish farming, B. Crop based – dairy husbandry – goat rearing, C. Crop based backyard pig rearing and backyard poultry rearing / goat rearing, D.
