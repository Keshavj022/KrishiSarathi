 Standardisation Activities in Agriculture Domain Significant Standardization work has already been done in the area of agriculture- 5.1. Standardization Activities in ITU ITU-T SG-20 has been working to create standards on IoT and its applications on Smart cities and communities since 2015. ITU-T SG-20 has also created a Focus Group on “Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) for Digital Agriculture (FG-AI4A)” on 21 October 2021 in collaboration with FAO to examine key concepts, and relevant gaps in current standardization landscape related to agriculture, and the best practices and barriers related to the use of AI and IoT-based technologies within this domain (more details available on https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4a/Pages/default.aspx). A large number of recommendations have been released in the IoT domain, some of the important standards are- Table 7: ITU Standards related to Agriculture Sl.

Standardization Activities in ISO Standardization roadmap on smart farming was developed by the International Standardization Organisation (ISO) Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) on Smart Farming. Nine thematic areas were examined in relation to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): crop production, livestock, urban farming, terminology and semantics, social aspects, supply Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report 5.
