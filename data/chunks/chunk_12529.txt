 It is to be noted that, the strategic development framework portrayed above has a strong emphasis on productivity enhancement and quality improvement. To conclude, the future of Kerala agriculture would depend considerably on how the scarce resources of the state are put into best use and the way in which a judicious balance between the competing sectors is achieved. Ideally, such a situation can be achieved when all factors of production and integration of agriculture and allied forms of activities are combined in the best possible manner. SUCCESS STORIES 1. Rice-based Integrated Farming System Rice fields in the coastal Kerala are typical wetland eco-system with numerous ecological and economic functions. High rainfall coupled with undulating topography of Kerala generates different moisture regimes for crop growth resulting in a wide range of micro-environments. Given the combination of season, and topography, rice in Kerala is grown under a variety of agronomic conditions ranging from totally dry to floating rice under rising flood conditions, from rainfed to irrigated conditions, sandy to clayey soils and saline to acidic soils. Crop diversification has immense potential in rice-based ecosystems. The studies conducted at Cropping Systems Research Centre, Karamana revealed that raising green manure (dhaincha), 293 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 bhindi or short duration cassava in paddy fields during summer not only enhanced the profitability and employment but also resulted in a shift of the obnoxious weed flora Echinochloa crusgalli. In rice-based diversified cropping systems, one crop of rice followed by two crops of Nendran banana offers high income potential. In such a system, over 10 t/ha crop residues are available for nutrient recycling. The economics of the rice-based IFS is presented in Table 4.

Rice-Fish-Duck-Buffalo Integration in Submerged Wetlands Integrated farming involving poultry and aquaculture has great relevance to the coastal rice lands such as Kuttanad, Kole and Pokkali/Kaippad. The coastal saline soils along the Ernakulam district are referred to as pokkali fields, whereas in the Alappuzha and Kannur districts they are known as Karilands and Kaipad, respectively. The traditional paddy cultivation involving a salt-resistant and tall pokkali variety of paddy, which is practiced during the rainy season from May-June to September-October is followed by shrimp filtration from November to April, in the saline phase.
