 The ICAR with its headquarters at New Delhi, coordinates, guides and manages research, education and extension in agriculture and allied sectors in the country with a vast network of 103 ICAR institutes including four deemed to be universities and one National Academy, three Central Agricultural Universities and 680 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK). ICAR also provides support to 66 State Agricultural Universities. ICAR envisions ensuring food and income security for all through technological innovations and sustainable agriculture. ICAR played an enabling role in ushering green revolution followed by yellow, white and blue revolutions in the country. The production of different commodities has increased many times during the past 65 years: food grains by 5.4 times, oilseeds by 6.2 times, milk by 9.6 times and fish by 14.4 times since 1950-51. Similarly, rice production by 3.6 times, wheat 4.3 times, maize 4.7 times, pearlmillet 4.4 times, pulses 2.7 times, cotton 10.9 times, sugarcane 5.36 times, jute 2.4 times and eggs 47.6 times since 1950-51 and meat 3.88 times since 1998- 99 are the glaring examples of technology led agricultural development in the country. India has emerged as the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world and their production has touched a record 299.5 million tonnes during 2016-17 which is about 3 times as compared to 1991-92 production. This sterling progress in production and productivity in ICAR-CGIAR Agricultural Cooperation 2 a variety of agro-climatic zones (128) of the country, has made a visible impact on the national food and nutrition security. ICAR has also played a major role in promoting excellence in higher agricultural education. 2. Cooperation with CGIAR centres Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is a global research partnership for a food-secure future. CGIAR science is dedicated to reducing poverty, enhancing food and nutrition security, and improving natural resources and ecosystem services. It works through 15 research centres located world-wide. ICAR as a nodal body has signed Memorandum of Understanding or Agreement with 12 of them. The first such Agreement was signed with the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in 1972, which was followed by International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) in 1974, International Potato Centre (CIP) in 1975, International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Land Areas (ICARDA) in 1986, International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in 1988, World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) in 1995, Bioversity International (BI), International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and International Centre for Living Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM, now WorldFish) in 1996 and International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in 2004.
