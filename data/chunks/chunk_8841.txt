 Even irrigated wheats PBW 502, HP 1731, CBW 13, HD 2824, Raj 3077, Raj 3765, Raj 4029 and Raj 4033 were found damaged by this mite; infestation was severe especially in Raj 3765 in Rajasthan. Two-spotted spidermite Tetranychus urticae damaged tomato and muskmelon, bottlegourd and spongegourd during April - June in Ludhiana. In Varanasi, Tetranychus ludeni affected cowpea from February onwards, with peak mite population in June and this declined with the onset of monsoon. In Kalyani, peak population of yellow mite Polychagotarsonemus latus on chilli was observed when the mean day temperature was 30.4°C; mite activity was observed between 28.5° and 30.5°C. Yield losses were of 24.9%. The coconut mite Aceria gurreronis was observed to infest and survive on palmyra Borassus flabellifer in Thondamattur and Sirugamani in Tamil Nadu; a single fruit harboured as many as 100 mites mostly on tepals. Feeding by the mites caused pale-brown patches on the inner side of the tepals, mild damage symptoms could be seen on the nut surface also. In Coimbatore, spot application of Fenpropathrin (3 ml/litre) and Endosulfan (4 ml/litre) resulted in 61-80% and 61-90% reduction in coconut mite population in 15 days. Of several newer molecules evaluated against mites infesting different crops like cowpea, chilli, okra, rose (both polyhouse and open cultivated), Fenpyroximate (15 to 30 g a.i./ha), Fenazaquin (125 g a.i./ha), Buprofezin (75-150 g a.i./ha), Diafenthiuron (300-600 g a.i./ha) were found promising against chilli yellow mite (Bangalore and Kalyani) and okra mite (Coimbatore and Ludhiana) up to 14 days causing 80-90% reduction in mite population. Fenpropathrin (0.02%) against spidermite in polyhouse roses in Navasari and Vertimec (0.042%) against T.ludeni on cowpea in Varanasi were also promising. Among the different botanicals screened, azadirachtin (300 and 500 ppm) gave a maximum of 50%-60% mortality of spider mite on okra crop in Varanasi. In Bangalore, commercial neem formulations exercised a maximum of 50-60% control of spidermite on vegetable pendal bean and okra, and these formulations were safe to the associated phytoseiid mite predator Amblyseius longispinosus. Amblyseius longispinosus was found as an efficient phytoseiid predator in okra, groundnut and cotton systems in Tamil Nadu. Amblyseius longispinosus and A multidentatus were major predators associated with spidermite on vegetables in Varanasi. Amblyseius longispinosus released at 20:1 ratio (prey: predator) brought down the population of Tetranychus urticae on carnation in polyhouse in Bangalore in 5 weeks and subsequent spidermite population build-up was minimal. EFFICACIOUS ‘MYCOHIT’—A MYCOACARICIDE Hirsutella thompsonii, the eriophyid mite- specific fungus, has been developed into a mycoacaricide named ‘Mycohit’, based exclusively on one of the superior strains- MF (Ag) 5 (ITCC 4962; IMI 385470). This is the first report of its kind. The product has a potency of 2.
