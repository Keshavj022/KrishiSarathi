Project Report. NAARM, Hyderabad (October 2012) 32 Table 16. Methods of pre-training preparation (Note: Percentages do not add up to 100 due to multiple responses) Information pertaining to Table 17 and 18 informs that majority of the participants of CAFT programmes (84 %) shared their learning experience and gains of the programme with their colleagues. However, they shared through informal discussion or just by sharing the resource material obtained from CAFT centres. This information suggests that to make CAFT training effective to the peer group, formal transfer of training to the peer group through seminars or presentations must be made compulsory by the CAFT centres. Such initiative also would inculcate seriousness in training transfer of CAFT themes by the participants. Table 17. Sharing training experience Option No. of Responses Percentage a.

Project Report. NAARM, Hyderabad (October 2012) 33 Table 18. Mechanism of sharing training experience (Note: Percentages do not add up to 100 due to multiple responses) Scanning through Table 19 infers that majority of the participants of CAFT programmes (69 %) utilized the knowledge and skill gained through CAFT programmes for fine-tuning their abilities pertaining to research programmes. It is heartening to know that in addition to addressing the teaching ability of the faculty, which is the prime expectation from the faculty of Universities, CAFT addresses the research abilities of the participants also. Thus, the improvement in the research competency provides the CAFT participantsâ€Ÿ adequate confidence in teaching the UG and PG students as well facilitates guiding the PG research projects in an effective manner.
