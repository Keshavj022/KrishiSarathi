 This can be achieved by tapping the water from rivers and rivulets through water channels and pipes along the hill slopes; construction of small and medium sized dams, barrages, and tanks on All of Small Rivers and Rivulets, and use the stored water by lift irrigation and/or gravity flow.   Supplement irrigation water supply through storage of spring water in large tanks, rainwater harvesting and recharge of the groundwater through check dams and percolation tanks.   Improve water use efficiency through drip and sprinkler irrigation, and moisture conservation through crop residue/polythene mulching and intercropping for sustainable crop production. Adopt precision farming, hydroponics and multi-story cropping systems. Adopt high/low/ultralow density plantings of different fruit trees to increase productivity.   Diversification of agriculture/ horticulture/ forestry through high value cash crops such as fruits (apple, plum, peach, pear, apricot, pecan nut, kiwi fruit, pomegranate, mango, litchi, orange, cherry), vegetables (tomato, peas, capsicum, beans, cole crops, and cucurbits), flowers(rose, carnation, chrysanthemum, Gerbera, marigold and gladiolus), agroforestry (Grevia, mulberry, poplar, willow), timberwood, mushrooms, beekeeping and medicinal plants (Valeriana jatamansi, Viola odorata, Picorrhiza kurroa Amla, and grafted Harar).   Improved and timely availability of quality seed of cereals, legumes, vegetables, flowers, and saplings of fruit plants (for example, hybrid seeds of okra, tomato, radish, carrot, cauliflower, bell pepper chilies, cabbage and beetroot), and appropriate varieties suited for State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 205 protective cultivation to the farmers.   Varietal shift and use of improved management practices for different fruit crops in different zones. For example: • Mango- Regular bearing and frost tolerant varieties in Zone I, and cultural management practices to regulate plant growth and fruit bearing for high productivity. • Citrus- Varietal shift and management practices, use of selective insecticides, and use of grass/ polythene mulching for moisture conservation. • Litchi–Ensured irrigation to avoid fruit cracking. • Peach, Plum, Apricot and Kiwi - Varietal shift and management practices with emphasis on training, pruning, and drip irrigation. • Apple and Pear - Shift to clonal rootstock based high/low/ultralow density plantations of self-fruiting varieties, supplemented with drip irrigation, proper training and pruning, managed pollination through pollinators and pollinizers. • Cherry - Management practices + use of drip irrigation. • Potato- Varietal shift to KufriHimalini andcultural management practices (potato - French bean system), effective white grub management can increase the yields by 17%. • Maize-Mixed cropping with pulses. • Wheat- Mixed cropping withmustard, chickpea or peas.
