It was observed that more than 92% plants planted at such a slope are surviving. The plant to plant distance varies from 5 m to 33 m, because of the death of a few consecutive plants in a row, showing that no replanting was done by the farmer. The mean plant height of the apple orchard on the slope is 6.57 feet with the range of 3 to 12 feet (Table 4). This indicated that this is a unique attempt and the plantation stock is young. Table 5.
