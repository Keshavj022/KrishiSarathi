Seed treatment with fungicides like Carbendazim 50 WP @ 2g/kg seed or Tricyclazole 75 WP @ 1.5g/kg seed is advisable to reduce intensity of fungal diseases. Rice variety Swarna Sukha Dhan has also recorded resistant against stem borer (dead heart and white ear head), and leaf folder and moderately resistant against whorl maggot and BPH under natural conditions but need based application of insecticides is recommended to manage the insects. For proper plant protection, prophylactic sprays of one dose of any systemic insecticide need to be sprayed as and when required. Quality characters Quality wise, Swarna Sukha Dhan shows high hulling recovery (78.4%), milling (70.9%), head rice Indian Farming 40 October 2023 recovery (68.4%), intermediate amylose content (22.32%) and alkali spreading value (4.0). It has desirable GC with very occasional chalkiness indicating good cooking quality. This rice variety produces medium slender grain, with test weight of 24.3 g. Grain of Swarna Sukha Dhan contains high amount of zinc (23.1 ppm) and iron (11.8 ppm). Economic benefit In rainfed as well as water limiting irrigated areas, adopting this variety gives a yield advantage of 0.7 to 1.0 t/ha over their local cultivated cultivars. Therefore, farmers can get a net benefit of `15000 to 20000/ha by adopting this variety. In this regard, this variety has much importance and potential in improving the livelihood of farm families in this region, where frequent drought is a common phenomenon. SUMMARY Under changing climate scenario, frequent occurrence of drought has been identified as key to low rice productivity in rainfed as well as water limited irrigated areas of eastern India, threatening food security of this region. The released and notified multiple stress tolerant rice variety Swarna Sukha Dhan shows significant yield superiority over national, zonal, and local check varieties in eastern states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. It shows desirable grain and cooking quality traits with high head rice recovery (HRR).
