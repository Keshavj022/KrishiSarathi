Foreword The post-Independence journey of Indian Agriculture has been quite impressive despite several limiting factors such as uncertainties of weather, declining soil health, increasing atmospheric temperature and emergence of more virulent pests and pathogens. The production of food grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, meat, egg and fish has increased significantly. Systematic and strategic research has led to development of new technologies to address specific needs of the farmers. These are being disseminated through the network institutions in the National Agricultural Research Education and Extension System (NAREES), regular interaction with state governments and other stakeholders, and increased use of digital platforms for communication. Still there exist gaps in transfer of technology/ information from lab to land. There is a need to strengthen our communication amongst all stakeholders. The 75th Year of Nation's independence is being celebrated as Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav. The DARE/ICAR has planned various activities to be undertaken for 75 weeks preceding 15th August 2022. These include awareness campaigns and lectures by eminent persons on the thematic areas for reaching out to maximum stakeholders particularly farmers on various new developments in different sectors of agriculture. This journey of 75 weeks shall culminate with congregation of farmers who have been successful in doubling their income, students and academicians with release of the compendium on farmer's success stories.
