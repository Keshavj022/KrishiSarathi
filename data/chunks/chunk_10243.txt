Jute The raw jute sector supports the livelihood of around 4 million farm families and also provides direct employment to 0.37 million workers in organized mills and diversified activities in jute trading. India is the largest producer and consumer of jute and jute products. About 85% of jute production is consumed in the domestic market, mainly for sacking (Saha and Hazra 2008). Government of India, under the Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packing Commodities) Act 1987, has made it mandatory that 100% of food grains and 20% of sugar are to be packed in jute sacks produced of jute grown in the country. During 2019-20, the jute was grown in an area of 6.8 million ha with a production of dry fibres of 9.5 million bales (1.71 Mt) with the average productivity of 2.53 t ha-1. In the year 1950-51, the country had around 0.57 Mha jute area with an annual production of 3.31 million bales of 180 kg each and productivity of 1.04 t ha-1, which was insufficient to cater the need of the jute industries in the country. Up to early seventies, the increasing demand of jute fibre as raw material was satisfied through the increase in the acreage of the crop in the country. As a result, the area almost doubled from 0.57 M ha in 1950-51 to 1.08 Mha in 1970-71. The production of raw jute also almost doubled from 3.31 million bales in 1950-51 to 6.19 million bales in 1970-71. The productivity, however, stagnated around Indian Agriculture after Independence 104 1.05 t ha-1. The jute area marginally decreased from 1.30 Mha in 1980-81 to 1.02 Mha in 1990-91 but the productivity increased sharply by almost 50% to 1.63 t ha-1, leading to increased production of 9.23 million bales. The area further dipped by 17% during 2000-01 to 2010-11 but the production stabilized around 10.6 million bales. The credit goes to rise in productivity by 17% during the same period due to the introduction of new varieties in the production system supported with improved location-specific technologies. After the partition of India in 1947, the major jute growing area went to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), whereas the jute industries remained in the eastern part of India.
