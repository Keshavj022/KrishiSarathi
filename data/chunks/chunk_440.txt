 All genotypes do not perform well under dual purpose, since the suitable variety should have the capability of early bulking as well as good regeneration Indian Farming 12 October 2023 after cutting. Varieties with high yield potential along with adequate nutrient management are two major factors that can increase fodder yield and quality. Package of practices for dual-purpose wheat Selection of varieties The selected variety should have good crop biomass production ability at an early stage as well as good regeneration capacity after fodder cut. Some of the dual-purpose wheat cultivars are VL Gehun 829, VL Gehun 616, VL Gehun 818 and VL Gehun 840. These are majorly recommended for north western Himalayan region with 7-10% grain yield loss. The present-day high- yielding varieties can also be used for this purpose. Some of them are DBW 222, HD2967 and DPW 21- 50. These varieties also yield green fodder at par with dual-purpose varieties with little reduction in grain yield. Case study on varieties performance in fodder and grain yield of wheat An experiment was conducted on different high-yielding varieties of wheat during 2021 at ICAR- NDRI, Karnal. The green fodder yield of dual-purpose wheat had been significantly affected by varieties. The higher green fodder yield was recorded with DBW 303 (138.17 q/ha) followed by DBW 187 (129.09 q/ha) and DBW 222 (121.91 q/ha). In fodder cutting treatment, higher grain yield was recorded with DBW 222 (47.23 q/ha) which was found statistically at par with DBW 187 (45.95 q/ha), and lower grain yield was recorded with DBW 303 (41.25 q/ha). In grain production only treatment (no fodder cutting), higher grain yield was recorded in DBW 303 (54.47 q/ha) followed by DBW 187 (53.35 q/ha) and DBW 222 (52.04 q/ha). Among the above varieties, the grain yield reduction due to fodder harvesting was around 8, 14 and 24%, in DBW 222, DBW 187 and DBW 303, respectively. The 25% higher dose of nitrogen after cutting for fodder was applied to crop to overcome cutting shock, and it helped in transition of vegetative buds to reproductive buds. Time of sowing Dual-purpose wheat can be sown early as it requires more time for regeneration to produce grains. Therefore, the optimum time for sowing is during the second fortnight of October. Seed rate and spacing The seed rate of dual-purpose wheat is more than grain purpose as it is grown for fodder purposes. Seed rate of at least 125 kg/ha should be used. The seeds should be treated with Azotobacter to ensure initial good growth of crops. The row spacing of 20-22 cm is maintained. Usually, line sowing is done after seedbed preparation in furrows by the kera and pora methods. It is also done through the drilling method by using seed drills or seed cum fertilizer drills as it is extensively used these days. Nutrient management Dual-purpose wheat requires a fertilizer dose of 150-175 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorous and 40 kg potash per hectare.
