The Scheme is implemented when there is at least 10% increase in production or 10% decrease in the ruling rates over the previous normal year. Market Intervention Scheme works in a similar fashion to Minimum Support Price based procurement mechanism for food grains, but is an ad-hoc mechanism. 3.5.2 Its objective is to protect the growers of these horticultural/agricultural commodities from making distress sale in the event of bumper crop during the peak arrival period when prices fall to very low level. Thus it provides remunerative prices to the farmers in case of glut in production and fall in prices. 3.5.3 The Department of Agriculture & Cooperation is implementing the scheme. Under MIS, funds are not allocated to the States. Instead, central share of losses as per the guidelines of MIS is released to the State Governments/UTs, for which MIS has been approved, based on specific proposals received from them. 19 (Rs.
