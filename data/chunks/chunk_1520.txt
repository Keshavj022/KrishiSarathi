 Compared to staple crops, these horticultural products often command higher prices in the market, allowing farmers to diversify their income streams and enhance their economic resilience. Challenges of dryland horticulture Dryland horticulture faces significant challenges due to water scarcity, poor soil quality, and extreme climate conditions. Limited rainfall, high temperatures, and unpredictable weather make it difficult to sustain crops, while poor soil fertility, salinity, and erosion further reduce productivity. Only a narrow range of drought- tolerant crops can thrive, and pests often pose a greater threat in these regions. Farmers in dryland areas also struggle with limited access to technology, infrastructure, and markets, leading to inconsistent yields and low economic returns. Climate change exacerbates these issues by increasing drought frequency and altering weather patterns, further threatening crop survival and productivity. Maximizing water efficiency Water scarcity is the primary challenge in dryland areas, making efficient water management crucial. Dryland horticulture emphasizes techniques such as drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting, and mulching to make the most of limited water resources. Drip irrigation delivers water directly to the plant roots, reducing evaporation and ensuring minimal water is wasted. Mulching, on the other hand, helps retain soil moisture and regulates soil temperature, creating a more favourable microclimate for crops. Rainwater harvesting systems collect and store rainwater during wet periods, providing a critical water supply during dry spells. These methods not only help farmers optimize water use but also increase crop yields in water-constrained regions. Climate-resilient farming Arid regions are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, and increased frequency of droughts. Dryland horticulture offers a climate-resilient approach by promoting crops that are naturally adapted to withstand these harsh conditions. This focuses on developing sustainable agricultural systems that can thrive in arid conditions and adapt to climate change. Efficient water management techniques like rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation are crucial, as are soil health practices such as crop rotation and organic manure. Protected cultivation, like polyhouses, shields crops from extreme climates, while integrated pest management reduces climate-induced risks. This approach boosts productivity, water efficiency, and farmer resilience in dryland areas. Farmers in dryland areas also adopt agroforestry practices, combining trees Success stories Horticulture in Indiaâ€™s drylands has witnessed impressive success through innovative practices and resilient crop choices.
