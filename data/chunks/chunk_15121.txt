 Benefits of Strengthening the Water Use Component: • Water Conservation and Efficiency: Adoption of modern irrigation methods like drip and sprinkler systems reduces water waste by delivering water directly to the root zone, improving water use ef­ ficiency, and conserving water resources. • Reduced Water Seepage and Losses: Implementation of practices such as ensuring pipe openings for every hectare of the farm helps to minimise water seepage into surface waters, preventing unnecessary loss of water. • Effective Water Storage and Backup Reservoirs: Farm ponds and efficient water storage mechanisms act as backup reservoirs during dry periods, ensuring water availability for agricultural needs without relying solely on groundwater, especially in the summer. • Even Water Supply (Land Levelling): Land levelling facilitates uni­ form water distribution across the farm, preventing over-irrigation in some areas and under-irrigation in others. This contributes to optimal water use and healthier crop growth. Overall positive impact on water scarcity and sustainable water management as given below: • Water Conservation: Efficient use of water through modern irrigation methods and proper infrastructure reduces water wastage and en­ sures the availability of water for a longer duration, mitigating water scarcity. • Sustainable Practices: Adoption of sustainable agricultural practices driven by enhanced knowledge (human capital) and efficient infra­ structure (real capital) contributes to the overall sustainability of water resources and agricultural systems. • Resilience to Climate Change: Improved water management capacity equips farmers to adapt to changing climate patterns and water availability, promoting resilience and sustainability in the face of climate-related challenges. • Community Collaboration: Strengthening social capital encourages cooperation and collaborative decision-making among farmers, fostering a sense of shared responsibility for water management and sustainability within the community. It can be assessed that, strengthening the capacity and water use components leads to enhanced water management practices, efficient water use, and a more sustainable approach to agriculture, ultimately positively impacting water scarcity challenges and contributing to long- term sustainable water management. In Environment Component; the study takes into account the envi­ ronmental factors that affect the quality and quantity of irrigation water. Water quality parameters such as pH are taken into account. Water quality is an indicator of a resource component. When all resources are abundant but water quality is not good, it affects crop yield and reduces water availability in the root zone. Long-term impacts of poor irrigation water for crops can have lasting impacts on the land. The study also takes into account fertilizer consumption per hectare of land and her­ bicide use in an annual crop cycle.
