Jatav and K. Naik Regional Sustainability 4 (2023) 218–234 228 3.1. Environmental sustainability index Among the mainstream 14 agro-climatic regions of India, WHR is more ecological sustainable, whereas SPHR is signiﬁcantly less environmental sustainability (Table 2). According to the cross-indicator analysis, the main inﬂuencing factors for lower environmental sustainability in SPHR compared to WHR are less forest coverage, less livestock, and less cropping intensity. In WHR, the forest area accounts for 24.13% of total geographical area, whereas it accounts for just 16.60% in SPHR. Further, about 86.63% of farmers own livestock in WHR, while corresponding statistics for SPHR is only 70.00%. Irrigation intensity is 125.25% in WHR, while it is only 116.73% in SPHR. Similarly, farmers in SPHR utilize more chemical fertilizers than farmers in WHR. 3.2. Economic security index The most crucial component of agricultural sustainability is the economic security index. Among the 14 mainstream agro-climatic regions of India, the results show that the farmers in TGPR have considerably better economic security, while those in EHR have substantially lower economic security (Table 3). The results of cross-indicator analysis reveal that, with exception of working in the MGNREGA, all other indicators in economic dimension of agricultural sustainability have better performance in TGPR than EHR. Ac- cording to the data, the TGPR has a man-land ratio of 34 persons/hm2, whereas the ratio is just 12 persons/hm2 in EHR. Moreover, the per capita income in TGPR was 839.16 USD, but it was just 222.85 USD in EHR in 2013. Irrigation intensity is also greater in TGPR 170.16%) than in EHR (64.18%). In 2011, about 90.00% of farmers have access to road in TGPR, but only 36.02% of farmers have access to road in EHR. Additionally, in TGPR, more than 55.00% of farmers obtain ﬁnance from institutional sources, while the proportion only reaches 35.25% in EHR. The food grain productivity of TGPR is also twice more than (4.13 t/hm2) that of EHR (1.68 t/hm2). Crop diversiﬁcation is more than 10.00% in TGPR but just 3.31% in EHR. In TGPR, more than 38.20% of farmers are aware of the minimum support price, but in EHR, the percentage is just 4.75%. Farmers in TGPR are more economic secure than those in EHR. 3.3. Social security index In India, social security is the most crucial pillar for agricultural sustainability and livelihood security. The results suggest that social security is comparatively high in SPHR, while the worst social security is in EHR (Table 4).
