05% at an interval of 15 days checked the spread of disease. Other pesticides found effective are deltamethrin (0.002%) or fenvalerate (0.01%). 3. For ber powdery mildew, 2‐4 sprays of dinocap or carbendazim or triedomorph or thiophenate methyl (0.1%) or wettable sulfur (0.2%) at 15‐20 days interval were found as effective at during the most vulnerable period starting with the onset of the disease. www.icar.org.in 44 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Horticulture 4. Pomegranate bark eating caterpillar can be effectively checked by spraying the infested bark with any of the pesticides like monocrotophos 36 WSC (0.08%), fenvalerate (20 EC (0.04%), quinalphos 25 EC (0.08%). 5. Rotational use of deltamelthrin 28 EC at 0.002% and carbaryl 50 WP at 21 days interval starting from fruit set has been found the most effective for the control of pomegranate fruit borer. 6. Black beetle (Chilocerus nigritus) has been identified as an effective predator of date palm scale. Post‐harvest Technology 1. Boiling of doka stage berries for 20 minutes followed by dehydration at 50o C for 70 hours is recommended for preparation of good quality dry dates (chhuhara). 2. Half dang stage berries can be processed to prepare soft dates (pind khajoor) by dehydrating at 50o C for 70 hours. Khalal stage of cv. Halawy has been found appropriate for making best quality dry dates in Kutch region of India. www.icar.org.in 45 2002‐2007 All India Coordinated Research Project on Cashew 1.

Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): • Local cashew germplasm material with desirable characters such as high yield, cluster bearing habit, bold sized nuts, short duration of flowering, off season flowering types from different cashew growing regions have been collected and clonally propagated and field planted in different centers. Number of cashew accessions so far collected and conserved by the Coordinating Centres in Regional Cashew Field Gene Banks is 1261 • A total of 27 high yielding cashew varieties have been developed and released for cultivation in different states by different centers of AICRP Cashew. • Location specific package of practices has been developed to different cashew growing states by the corresponding centre of AICRP on Cashew. • Intercrops such as ginger, turmeric, cluster bean, black gram, horse gram, ground nut, or vegetables, or medicinal plants along with cashew as main crop during the initial stage of orchard establishment have been identified for enhancing net returns by different centres of AICRP on Cashew.
