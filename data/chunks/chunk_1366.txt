org/wed Indian Farming 53 October 2024 Success story of a natural farmer from Solan district of Himachal Pradesh Anurag Sharma, Meera Devi*, Arti Shukla and Amit Vikram HRTS & KVK, Kandaghat, Solan, Himachal Pradesh 173 213 To most of the farmers, pesticide use is an inevitable aspect of farming, however, injudicious use of pesticides can pose serious risk to the environment, soil health, human beings and also to the animals. Hence, need of the hour is to shift from chemical based farming to natural farming which is a low-input and climate-resilient farming system that encourages farmers to use low-cost locally- sourced inputs, eliminating the use of artificial fertilizers and industrial pesticides. Shri Madan Gopal is one such farmer who is growing different cash crops under natural farming system with higher net returns as compared to chemical farming system. Keywords: Natural farming, Pesticide, Soil health, Sustainable farming, Vermicompost S HRI Madan Gopal, a progressive farmer, is setting an example in natural farming, a practice essential in today’s agricultural scenario. He hails from 'Patti, Dharot' in the Kandaghat block of Solan district, where chemical farming of tomato, capsicum, pea, and cauliflower predominates, and farmers are largely unaware of natural farming practices. Initially, he engaged in chemical farming of vegetables in his village but grew concerned about low productivity and rising cultivation costs. Although he began his venture in 2017, his initial lack of proper knowledge led to severe losses in vegetable production. However, after receiving training from KVK, Solan and the Department of Agriculture (ATMA), and in consultation with scientists at KVK Solan, he adopted natural farming for vegetables in 2017. Demonstrations on natural farming were conducted by Krishi Vigyan Kendra on his fields to encourage his adoption of the practice. The initiative proved successful, and he now cultivates 5 bighas of land using natural farming methods. He has established his own 'Prakritik Sansadhan Bhandhar' and vermicompost unit, where he prepares and supplies natural farming formulations such as Beejamrit, Jeevamrit, Dashparni Ark, Agniastra, Brahmastra, and vermicompost to farmers at minimal rates. Natural farming improves soil structure and fertility through the use of Jeevamrit, mulching, crop rotation, and N-fixing crops that add atmospheric nitrogen to the soil. It also prevents soil erosion and compaction by using mixed and relay cropping. Additionally, it promotes natural pest control practices instead of synthetic pesticides.
