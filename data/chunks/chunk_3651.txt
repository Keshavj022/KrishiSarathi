This Mini Mission aims at promoting processing industry for value addition to horticulture produce by promoting new processing units, upgradation of existing units and promotional activities. The scheme had tremendous response in the form of enhanced production and productivity of horticulture crops. Based on the success of the mission and demand from Himalayan States, the mission was extended to Himachal Pradesh, J&K and Uttarakhand in 2003-04 and subsequently during 2005-06, the mission was extended to potential districts of all states as National Horticulture Mission. During X plan period, mission in NE states was implemented with an outlay of ` 845.00 crores. During XI plan period, an outlay of ` 2,500.70 was approved and during XII period an outlay of ` 3,000.00 crores was approved for the programmes. Table 4.

The impact of the mission led to phenomenal increase in production of horticulture crops i.e. fruits, vegetables, plantation crops, floriculture and spices and provided avenues for higher income to farmers. The increased levels of production can be seen by comparing the production levels of the base year 2000 with the current level as given in Tables.
