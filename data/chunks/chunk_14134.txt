 b) Contribution of profenofos dissipation processes, expressed as a proportion of applied mass, as determined by the model. J. Masbou et al. Journal of Hazardous Materials 488 (2025) 137428 9 fractionation was identified, distinguishing photolysis from biodegra­ dation processes. These findings provide critical insights for assessing pesticide degradation in agroecosystems, enhancing contamination risk evaluations, and guiding agricultural practices. The integration of ki­ netic modeling and isotope analysis represents a powerful tool for pol­ icymakers and water management agencies to develop more effective mitigation strategies against pesticide contamination in tropical environments.
