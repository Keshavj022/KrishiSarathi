 FARM IMPLEMENTS Code : 1856 Title of the ITK : Direct seeding of onion/lucerne seeds by using hand operated tool Description of the ITK : Direct seeding of onion/lucerne seeds is done by hand operated single bowl seed drill by the farmers of Ahmednagar district in Maharastra. It is a single purpose machine and man power is needed for operation. The cost of the implement is Rs 500 and it weighs 5 kg. 1.2 ha area is covered by a single pair of human labour in a day. The approximate life time of the implement is 3 years. The cost of operation is Rs 22/ha. Twenty five farmers of this village are using this method since 10 years. Name and address of the discloser : Head, Department of Agronomy, Mahatma Phule Krishi Vishwavidyalaya, Rahuri (Maharashtra) 413 722 Location of use of the ITK : The seed drill is being used in Brahmani, Umbre, Vambori, Dhamori, Khadambe villages of Rahuri block in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra. Experimenters : Dr A.G.Wani, Sorghum Agronomist, Sorghum Improvement Project, Mahatma Phule Krishi Vishwavidyalaya, Rahuri (Maharashtra) 413 722 METHODOLOGY Experimental method Five experiments with onion and lucerne were conducted in farmers' fields during rabi season of 2002_03. Sowing was done in medium black soil having depth of 45_60 cm. The sowing by single bowl seed drill at a spacing of 12 cm between rows and 7.5 cm between the two plants was done with two labourers. The seeds were placed 2_3 cm depth with good soil contact and seed covering in flat beds having size of 3.0_2.4 m with fine soil tilth. Fertilization and plant protection measures were given as per the recommendation of each crop. Irrigations were applied as per the requirement of the crops. Farmers method Broadcasting method of sowing in flat beds in case of lucerne, and transplanting of seedlings of onion on ridges and furrows was done. The distance between two rows of lucerne was 30 cm and transplanting of seedlings of onion was done on both sides of the ridges with distance of 7.5 cm between two plants. Fertilization, plant protection and irrigation were applied as per the recommendations and requirement of the respective crops. For lucerne, N_P_K were applied @ 15_15_40 kg/ha at the time of sowing. Onion received 50_50_50 kg N_P_K/ha before transplanting. Top dressing with 50 kg/ha was done after one month of transplanting. Harvesting of onion was carried out in the month of April. Five cuttings were obtained from lucerne crop. RESULT AND DISCUSSIONS Experiment Onion:Observations on growth recorded in onion crop, indicated that germination was upto 97% with use of seeding implement and the crop   FARM IMPLEMENTS Table 1.
