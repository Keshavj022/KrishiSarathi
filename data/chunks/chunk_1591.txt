 Additionally, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) can collectively manage processing and marketing, reducing individual costs, improving market access and ensuring better returns for members. This has led to increase in area under cumin cultivation. A value chain for millet products has been developed, with Women Self-Help Groups producing items like biscuits, cakes, and snacks. Their products are now sold online and gaining recognition. One of the self-help group supported by CAZRI has got the opportunity to display its products to the Wives of Head of the Nations of G20 countries in Delhi Summit 2023. Agri-voltaic systems Agri-voltaic systems combine solar power generation with crop cultivation, offering a sustainable solution for water-scarce regions like Rajasthan. Besides generating electricity, solar panels provide surface area for rain water harvesting and providing additional income for the farmers. The Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) scheme provides subsidies for installing solar panels, making such investments more accessible. Moreover, Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Limited (RRECL) offers incentives and guidance, enhancing the feasibility of these projects. FPOs can also play a role in facilitating the adoption of these systems by pooling resources and negotiating better terms with solar technology providers. Indian Farming 75 (01): 93-97; January 2025 Indian Farming 94 January 2025 Livestock and forage-based enterprises Raising small ruminants like goats and sheep is ideal for arid regions due to their adaptability to limited vegetation. Local breeds like Sirohi and Marwari offer high returns through meat, milk, and wool production, providing a steady income stream. The National Livestock Mission (NLM) offers subsidies for animal shelters and healthcare, reducing costs for farmers. Additionally, cultivating drought-resistant forage like sorghum and hybrid Napier grass ensures consistent fodder availability, supporting dairy production even in dry periods. The Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) provides funds to enhance fodder production, boosting livestock productivity and reducing feed costs. Value addition in cow-based products like A2 milk, desi ghee, and organic fertilizers opens niche markets for farmers. Support from NABARD and the Dairy Entrepreneurship Development Scheme (DEDS) for small processing units further boosts profitability. High-value horticulture and protected cultivation Protected cultivation in greenhouses or polyhouses enables year-round, off-season production of crops like bell peppers and strawberries, leading to higher yields, premium market access, and improved profitability by shielding crops from harsh weather. The Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) provides financial assistance for setting up such structures, reducing the initial investment burden.
