 An encouraging pattern that has emerged is that GER for male population is 26.3% while for females, it is 26.4%. The Gross Enrolment Rate for Agricultural Education, out of the total eligible population in the country, is below 1% which is abysmally low. In the recent past, the number of applicants especially for UG admissions has increased significantly showing growing interest towards higher agricultural education. During AIEEA-2019, for each seat in UG, there were around 85 applicants and for PG there were 10. For UG, in comparison to AIEEA-2014, when the number of applicants per seat was 53, though the competition has remarkably increased, still in comparison to medical courses where for each seat there are about 50,000 candidates, we need to go a long way. * Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) or Gross Enrolment Index (GEI) is a statistical measure used in the education sector to determine the number of students enrolled in school at different grade levels in a country that indicates the ratio of the number of students who live in that country to those who qualify for the particular grade level. 3.1 All India Entrance Examination for UG Admissions [AIEEA (UG)] ICAR’s 24thAIEEA (UG)-2019 examination was conducted in LAN-based CBT mode at 128 examination centers, involving 796 venues, across the country to enable a large number of candidates to appear in this examination.
