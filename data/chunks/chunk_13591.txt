 A set of indicators forms the basis for the government to classify poorer households and provide BPL cards. D. Varshney, P.K. Joshi, A. Kumar et al. World Development 160 (2022) 106067 3 The average landholding is approximately 0.74 ha.9 The survey revealed that 78 % of household heads report farming as their pri- mary occupation. The average value of the asset index is about 0.01 on a scale of 2.30 to 6.10.10 The positive value of the index suggests that ownership of an asset is highly indicative of ownership of other assets. The average value of the asset index for the poorest quintile is about 1.68 and for the richest quintile is about and 2.8. Feder et al. (1985) and Awotide, Diagne, Wiredu, and Ojehomon (2012) argued that wealthier farmers are more likely than poor farmers to take risks associated with adopting new technology. The survey reveals that the average household head has 18 years of farming experience. Only 44 % of households have a Kisan Credit Card (KCC) that would allow them access to institutional credit.11 For example, Varshney, Joshi, and Roy (2019) showed that a Kisan Credit Card is vital for adopting improved technologies. Table 1 shows that 15 % of households have a soil health card, which ana- lyzes farmers’ land and offers recommendations for nutrient man- agement.12 Accounting for this variable helps us understand farmers’ scientiﬁc approaches to agriculture. About one in seven (14 %) farmers have access to Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, a crop insurance program. Crop insurance can serve as a risk-sharing mechanism for farmers adopting new technology. Presumably, farm- ers with crop insurance are more likely than their counterparts to adopt new and improved technology. We also present plot charac- teristics such as soil color, irrigation, and soil fertility, which play an essential role in technology adoption. For instance, improved irri- gation conditions are expected to inﬂuence the adoption of new technology that requires greater irrigation. Table 1 also compares the proﬁle of wheat farmers across KVK and non-KVK villages. Compared to farmers in non-KVK villages, farmers in KVK villages are generally younger (by 2.7 years), have higher educational attainment (0.52 years), are 5 % more likely to engage in farming for a livelihood, have less farm experience (3.0 years), and are 7 % more likely to have a soil health card. Fur- ther, farmers across KVK and non-KVK villages have varying soil color, fertility, and irrigation conditions. Figure 1 shows the adop- tion patterns of wheat cultivars for 2015–16 and 2017–18. In 2015–16, 34 % of farmers adopted PBW-343, a wheat variety released in 1996. PBW-502, released in 2004, was adopted by 24 % of farmers, and HD-2967, released in 2011, was adopted by 26 % of farmers. Almost one in ﬁve (17 %) farmers adopted other cultivars.13 In 2017–18, 32 % of farmers adopted PBW-343, 8 % adopted PBW-502, 47 % adopted HD-2967, and 14 % adopted other cultivars.
