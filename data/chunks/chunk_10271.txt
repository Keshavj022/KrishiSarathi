 It is expected that current research programs of ICAR would lead to a technology driven growth for safe production of nutritious food, better environmental and nutritional security, higher profitability and self-reliance in horticultural crops and thereby rise to make India Kuposhanmukt and Atmanirbhar. Besides, this sector has enormous potential for meeting much needed eradication of problems of rural poverty, unemployment, livelihood opportunities, malnutrition and nutritional security.
