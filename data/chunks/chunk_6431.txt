5 1/ha), whereas, application of 120 g N/ha through NADEP compost produced highest yield (218.3 q/ha) in sponge gourd which was at par with inorganic treatment under weed mat mulching. In okra, highest yield (132.4 q/ha) was recorded by application of 180 kg N through inorganic fertilizer followed by Vermicompost and FYM. During rabi, the highest yield (331.45 q/ha) and curd weight (1.504 kg) in cauliflower was noted under weed mat mulching coupled with N 200 kg/ha. Among organic manures, maximum yield (324.31 q/ha) was recorded with vermicompost prepared from radish residue followed by Pea straw. Bio-priming of tomato seeds with Trichoderma + M44 increased the tomato yield significantly. Spray of humic acid @ 10 ml/l twice at 45 and 60 days after transplanting increased tomato yield by about 19%. The response of humic acid was more pronounced under NADEP and FYM organic sources. The quality of vegetables in terms of vitamin C content was better under organic system as compared to inorganic system. In cauliflower, the ascorbic acid (41.28 mg/100 g), antioxidant (24.2%) and total phenol content (38.22 mg/100 g) were higher in organic system than the inorganic treatment. The quality of tomato was also improved under organic farming as compared to inorganic treatment. Enhancing water productivity in okra: In spring- summer okra, drip irrigation scheduling and mulching significantly enhanced the leaf area, dry matter production, number of fruits/plant and fruit yield. Maximum fruit yield of 121.96 q/ha was recorded with drip irrigation twice a day at 100% ET + bicolour (black- white) mulch with an improvement of 106.25% than control (surface irrigation without mulch). Grafting technology in vegetable crops: Inter- specific grafting in cucumber revealed that maximum no. of fruits (15.1/plant) and fruit yield (2.835 kg/plant and 168.78 q/ha) was obtained when grafted over Summerfit rootstock (a hybrid of snap melon × acid melon). Graft combination of IVBR-17 + Kashi Chayan was the best combination with least reduction in yield (25.39%) under high salinity stress (8 dS m-1) followed by IVBR 17 + Kashi Adarsh (28.57%) and IC 111056 + Kashi Chayan (29.96 %). Improving drought stress tolerance in okra: The okra genotypes VRO 128 and VRO 160 showed comparatively lesser decrease in relative water content (12.1% and 15.31%), membrane stability index (14.0% and 16.46%) and total chlorophyll content (13.5% and 17.0%) as well as lesser increase in MDH content (10.0% and 12.9%), H2O2 content (87.3% and 107.8%) and proline content (206.8% and 231.3%) under moisture deficit condition. These genotypes showed higher increase in peroxidase (2.36 and 1.92 Μm/g/ min) and catalase (1.67 and 1.36 92 Μm/g/min) activity under moisture deficit stress and lesser reduction in root surface area (11.18%) and root volume (8.72%) and yield (9.7% and 10.5%, respectively) under moisture deficit condition.
