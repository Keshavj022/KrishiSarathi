 Comparative economics of DSR and PTR From the results of the study, it has been observed that use of almost all the inputs was significantly lower in DSR as compared to PTR resulting in reduction in the cost of human labour, animal labour, machine labour and fertilizers (including manure) by 40.5, 25, 15.0, 7.6% over the PTR though it enhanced the cost of seed and plant protection measures by 72.7 and 44.3% (Table 1). The total variable costs involved in DSR were about 16% lower than the PTR. As the DSR does not require raising seedlings in nursery, puddling, transplanting and continued water submergence like that in PTR, the overall water requirement for DSR paddy cultivation is reduced by about 16%. The groundwater draft for paddy cultivation was estimated to the tune of about 6366 m3 per acre in the case of DSR as against 7569 m3 per acre in the case of PTR method. Thus, if the entire area under paddy in the state is sown by DSR technology, the ground water use will be about 49.46 billion cubic meters (BCM) whereas in the case of PTR method it will be about 58.81 BCM. Therefore, about 9.35 BCM water may be saved annually in the state by shifting from PTR to DSR method of paddy transplanting/sowing. Inspite of marginally lower yield of paddy in DSR (2769 kg/acre) than PTR (2801 kg/acre), the returns over variable Tar-wattar direct seeded rice field Table 1.

Indian Farming 38 August 2023 costs were observed to be higher by about 9% in DSR (`35945/acre) than PTR (`33095/acre) because of lesser variable costs involved in DSR technology (Table 1). The cost to produce one kg paddy with DSR was found to be lower (`6.8/kg) by about 15% than with PTR (`8/kg). Constraints in adoption of DSR An attempt has been made to identify the various reasons for non-adoption of DSR. As per the perception of 80% respondents, the easy availability of labour for transplanting paddy was the major reason for not following the DSR. Other perceptions like lack of technical knowledge of DSR (77.5%), diffidence in adopting DSR (72.50%) and non-availability of required machinery/implements for sowing (55%) were the major reasons for not opting DSR. Other reasons such as high risk of weed infestation and rodent attack and experiences of fellow farmers were reported by about 43 and 28%, respectively.
