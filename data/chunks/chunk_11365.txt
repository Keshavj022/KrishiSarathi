 In case of bold seeded varieties, seed rate can be increased up to 100 kg/ha. For seed treatment with Bio-Fertilizers make 10% gur/jagary solution and mix Rhizobium spp. @ 5-10 gm /kg seed in the solution. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 58 Do not treat seeds with fungicides in case seeds are being inoculated. Line sowing with the help of seed drill or opening the furrows at 30 cm apart. The seed should be placed 5 to 6 Cm deep in the soil. Pre-emergence spray of pendimethalin @ 1 kg a.i./ha at 2-3 DAS. Lentil Sowing should be completed up to first fortnight of November. Recommended varieties areShalimar Masoor -1, Shalimar Masoor -2 For preparation of land, minimum two ploughings are recommended. Apply well decomposed compost or FYM uniformly @ 10-15 t/ ha and should be incorporated in the soil at the time of land preparation. Application of vermicompost @ 2.5 t /ha will replace 5 t FYM/ha and 25% NPK from recommended dose of fertilizers. For Lentil, urea @ 0.75 kg/kanal, DAP @ 6.5 kg/kanal, and MOP 2.5 kg/kanal should be applied as basal dose at the time of last ploughing and then level the land by planking before seed sowing. Seed rate of 40 kg /ha is recommended Seed should be treated with Rhizobium. Make 10% gur/jagary solution and mix Rhizobium species @ 5-10 gm /kg seed in the solution. Seed should be dipped in the solution for 10 minutes followed by drying under the shade. Do not treat seeds with fungicides in case seeds are being inoculated. Seed should be sown in lines at a spacing of 25 cm apart. Pre-emergence spray of pendimethalin @ 0.75 kg a.i./ha within 2-3 DAS to control the weeds effectively. Oat fodder Recommended varieties are Sabzar, Shalimar Fodder Oats-1 Oats requires a well prepared and firm field for good germination of seed. Usually, two ploughings followed by single harrowing ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 59 should be given to bring the soil to a fine tilth. Apply well decomposed compost or FYM uniformly @ 10-15 t/ha in the soil at the time of land preparation. Application of vermicompost @ 2.5 t /ha will replace 5 t FYM/ha and 25% NPK from recommended dose of fertilizers. In fodder oats urea @ 5.6 kg/kanal, DAP @ 6.5 kg/kanal and MOP 3.4 kg/kanal should be applied as basal dose at the time of last ploughing and then level the land by planking before seed sowing. Sowing of seed should be done up to 15th October. Oat seed required100 kg/ha (when sown as sole), Seed should be sown in lines 20 cm apart. During Feb-March as soon as growth starts in the last week of month apply top dose of urea @ 3.25 kg/kanal Vegetables Peas Prepare land thoroughly & apply FYM @ 1 ton per kanal along with Urea, DAP and MOP @ 4, 6.5 & 5kg per kanal respectively. Recommended varieties are Bonneville, Shalimar mattar. Seed rate 4-4.5kg/ kanal. For obtaining early crop with higher yield apply 75% of urea DAP, MOP @ 3.
