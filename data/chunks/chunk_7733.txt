 Banana bunch harvester: The newly developed banana bunch harvester is used for harvesting banana bunches from the tree of var. Grand Naine and other traditional varieties. Its height of reach is 1.1 to 2.7 m, weight of bunch handled is about 14–17 kg and the coverage of harvester is 25–30 trees/h. Auger plough for green manuring and straw incorporation: The green manuring and straw incorporation involve high labour and cost in traditional practice. To address the problem, a tractor operated two bottom auger plough was developed which consists of cutting unit, truncated/shortened mould board and vertical rotating clod-crusher/soil-ripper. Field trials were carried out to incorporate green manure crop Dhaincha (Sesbania bispinosa) at two stages of crop growth, viz. 36 days and 50 days with biomass density of 15.4 and 22.5 tonnes/ ha, respectively. Its actual field capacity is 0.25–0.28 ha/ h and fuel consumption 6.7–8.2 litre/h, at a forward speed of 3.5 km/h with 175–179 mm depth of operation. The soil pulverization and mixing index with the developed machine varied from 5.6 to 10.4 mm and 93.7 to 96.2%, respectively. Irrigation channel former: Traditionally the irrigation channel for orchards is formed manually using hand tools, which is a drudgerous and pain taking activity. A tractor operated irrigation channel former for making irrigation channels in orchards was developed. The developed equipment was evaluated at forward speed ranging from 2.1 to 2.8 km/h for making irrigation channels. The channel formed is of trapezoidal shape with 610 mm and 390 mm of top and base width, respectively. The depth and outer width of channel formed is 244 mm and 1,080 mm, respectively. The average fuel consumption for making irrigation channels is about 6.1 l/h. The labour requirement with developed equipment is 0.05 man-h/m, whereas it was 0.16 man-h/ m with manual method. The savings in labour and cost of operation is about 68.7% and 61.2%, respectively, compared to manual method. The machine can form 1,760–1,875 m long channel in 1 h. Vegetable transplanter for cell feed nursery: The high missing index, labour requirement and mortality rate of seedlings are hindrance in promotion of existing transplanters developed in India. To overcome these lacunas, a two-row semi-automatic vegetable transplanter Tractor operated irrigation channel former having cup-type metering mechanism for cell feed nursery was developed. The metering unit consists of 5 vertical cups mounted over a disc of 500 mm diameter. The developed transplanter could transplant seedlings with plant missing of less than 4%. The effective field capacity of the machine for transplanting tomato, brinjal and chilli seedlings is 0.11, 0.12, and 0.15 ha/h at a forward speed of 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 km/h, respectively.
