 Seed Production of Gangetic Prawn, Macrobrachium gangeticum The seed production trial of gangetic prawn, Macrobrachium gangeticum (Bate) synonym M. birmanicum choprai (Tiwari) were carried out in plastic pool following air-lift biofilter recirculatory system. The larvae were reared in brackishwater of 12-14 ppt salinity. The larvae passed through eleven larval stages with 16-18 molts. The first few post larvae occurred on 22nd day. A record production of 13,043 post larvae @ 43 PL/I was achieved with about 90% metamorphosis during 45 days of rearing cycle. DEVELOPMENT OF MAHSEER FISHERY FOR SPORT FISHING IN KUMAON LAKES The NRC on Coldwater Fisheries initiated to develop mahseer fishery in an upland lake, Shyamalatal situated at an altitude of 1290 above mean sea-level near Sukhidang in Champawat district of Uttranchal State, both for brood stock rearing and consequent angling. In all 6000 fingerlings of golden mahseer (35- 90 mm) were released in the lake. The first monitoring revealed that the fish has adjusted in the new environment and growth was quite satisfactory. Within a period of 2-6 months the mahseer (Tor putitora) fingerlings registered growth to a size range of 85-150 mm. This lake has a potential to be developed as sport fishing activity and generate income to local community in this remote area. FISH PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING 127 Culture of Freshwater Prawn in Pens The giant freshwater prawn, M. rosenbergii cultured in pens installed in beels for a period ranging from 92-95 days attained a size range of 135 mm/38 g to 148 mm/ 57 g at a stocking density ranging from 21,000 to 25,000 nos./ha. A yield of 484 to 588 kg/ha was obtained in 92-95 days of culture. Evaluation of Dairy Effluents for Aquaculture Activity To evaluate the potential of dairy effluents for aquaculture, a pen enclosure (0.011 ha) was constructed in the lagoon near the discharge point of dairy plant effluent. The pen was stocked with fingerling of Indian major and minor carps (catla, rohu, mrigal, silver carp and bata) at 5000 nos./ha. The fishes were reared for 6 months. All the species stocked exhibited very good growth indicating the potential of dairy effluent for aquaculture. The estimated productions of fish within six months was 3.5 tonnes/ha. Development of Phosphatase Producing Bacterial Biofertilizers for Aquaculture Bacterial isolates were collected and screened for phosphatase activity from both pond water and sediments. Out of the total 1079 bacterial isolates collected one hundred were found to be potential alkaline phosphatase enzyme producers. The study has indicated the possibility of using bacterial biofilter in fish farming activities in the country.
