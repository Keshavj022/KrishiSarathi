 The mean body weight at 20 and 40 weeks of age, egg weight at 32 and 40 weeks of age, and egg number up to 40 weeks of age were 2512 g, 3,488 g, 56.7 g, 60.8 g and 59 eggs, respectively. As compared to earlier generation the egg production up to 280 days of age and egg weight at 32 and 40 weeks of age remained stable. In female line,body weight at 5 weeks of age was recorded in S 11 generation. At 6 weeks of age, females and males were selected based on 5-week body weight Vanaraja male parent Vanaraja female parent Colour broiler population DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 108 and were maintained on restricted feeding schedule. The average intensity of selection for body weight at 5 weeks of age for the males, females and combined sex was 0.96 σ, 0.56σ and 0.56σ, respectively. The mean body weight at 20 and 40 weeks of age, egg weight at 32 and 40 weeks of age and egg number up to 40 weeks of age were 2,482 g, 3,432 g, 56 g, 60 g and 59 eggs, respectively. As compared to earlier generation, the egg production up to 280 days of age showed an improvement of 2 eggs on phenotypic scale without any change in egg weight at 32 and 40 weeks of age. Backyard poultry production in Orissa: At the CARI Regional Centre, Bhubaneswar, field performance of colour broiler, frizzle cross, naked neck cross and CD birds was studied. CARI-Dhanaraja and CARI-Debendra attracted the tribals more due to their colour pattern, rapid growth, better adaptability and survivability in free-range system. They attended the body weight of more than 1 kg in 10 weeks of age (1,165 ± 83 g) and above 1,500 g at 14th week (1,686 ± 17 g). These birds started laying at 24–26th week with average of 150–180 eggs/year. The CARI- Gold started to lay brown eggs of good size at the age of 140 days. The production varied from 200–230 eggs/year. The average egg weight was 51 g at 35 weeks of age. Maintenance of parent lines and collection of data (on farm research) is continuing. Three-way cross B77, as male line performed very well as compared to a female line. QUAIL The regeneration and selection programmes in different quail lines continued for meat and egg production. Individual selection for high 5-week body weight was the major selection criterion in CARI-Uttam, CARI-Ujjawal, CARI-Sweta and control. Further, the CARI-Pearl (White egg shell line) was selected initially on the basis of high 5-week body weight, and later mild selection on the basis of egg production and egg weight at 18th week of age was carried out to improve the reproductive traits. The phenotypic and genetic responses for different economic traits in broiler and layer quail lines were estimated in respective lines. GUINEAFOWL Mass selection continued in Pearl variety of guineafowl for 12 weeks body weight. Divergent selection continued in Lavender variety of guineafowl and S2 generation was generated in high and low SRBC lines.
