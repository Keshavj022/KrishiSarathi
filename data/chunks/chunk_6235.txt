Phyto-biochemical analysis: Cassia tora plant (leaves) was procured from Banagalore. After complete drying at room temperature, it was powdered and methanolic extract was prepared with Soxhlet assembly. In-vitro antimicrobial activity of juice: Antibiogram of Takala leaves juice was determined against E. coli isolated from clinical cases of diarrhea in goats using different concentration (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 mg per disc). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Therapeutic efficacy Results obtained for treatment of diarrhoea using takala flower juice at MASFSU are presented in Tables 1 and 2. In parasitic diarrhoeic animals, faecal examination revealed mixed infestation of Trichuris, Strongale and Moneizia spp. Complete recovery in parasitic diarrhea was achieved with standard therapy on an average of 1.5 days. The EPG was reduced from 1545 to 0 level in this group by day 6. Administration of takala flower juice significantly reduced the dehydration score and faecal consistency score by day 6, particularly in cases of non-parasitic diarrhoea. The average recovery period in ITK treated groups was 4.55 and 6.5 days in parasitic and non-parasitic diarrhoea respectively. The standard treatment, however, brought about clinical recovery within 1.5 and 5.66 days respectively. The flower juice also reduced EPG in parasitic diarrhoea from 0 day values of 1158.3+247.8 to 966.66 ±212.79. This indicated possible anthelmintic activity of the flower juice of takala (Cassia tora). The changes in hematobiochemical paramaters simulated the clinical recovery profile.
