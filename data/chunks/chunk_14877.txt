 Moreover, the C input due to crop residue addition and leaf litter incorporation is also more in the forest, ZT, and RT than CT, which may have promoted the gradual stratification of SOM in these land uses (Patra et al., 2019a). The SR of SOM increased significantly along with the soil profile down the soil depth due to the lowering of the concen­ tration of SOM from surface to subsurface (Ussiri and Lal, 2009; Patra et al., 2019a). The variation in SR among land uses may have developed due to soil profile disturbance by different tillage practices, as tillage leads to the incorporation of SOM in deeper layers (Xue et al., 2015). The Fig. 4. Variation of concentration of (A) SOC and (B) TN under different land use practices (Forest, ZT, RT, and CT). The bars present mean ± SD (m = 3). The different uppercase alphabets imply significant differences across treatments for a given soil depth, and the lowercase alphabets imply significant differences across the soil depths for a given treatment (P < 0.05). S.K. Kar et al. Geoderma Regional 32 (2023) e00616 8 concentration of SOM in surface soil is increased because agricultural residues are retained in the topsoil, and also, an undisturbed soil profile was caused due to relatively higher SR in CA practices than in CT (Zhao et al., 2015). 3.3. Storage of soil organic matter To correct the error in the estimation of storage of SOM due to var­ iations in soil bulk density developed due to different land uses, tillage practices, and residue management (Zhao et al., 2015), an ESM method was considered in the current research. In the ESM approach, the vari­ ation in soil mass for different land uses due to variation in soil bulk density was considered for assessment on an equivalent mass basis. As in the case of the fixed depth method, the layer having higher bulk density would lead to higher soil mass and higher storage of SOM, which is incorrect. For example, considering the topsoil layer given in Fig. 6, the bulk density also varied among land uses due to various land manage­ ment practices. As compared to CT, all other land uses have lower bulk density; hence for the top layer (0–5 cm), CT has more soil mass (626.66 Mg ha−1) followed by RT (589.11 Mg ha−1), ZT (567.87 Mg ha−1) and forest (546.52 Mg ha−1). Therefore, a certain amount of soil mass was hypothetically added to the top layers in RT, ZT, and forest to attain an equivalent soil mass in the top layer. Then, the exact amount of soil mass was subtracted from the subsequent bottom layer. In the present case, 37.55 Mg ha−1, 58.79 Mg ha−1, and 80.14 Mg ha−1 of soil mass were subtracted from the bottom layer and added to the top layer for RT, ZT, and forest land, respectively, to attain an ESM of 626.66 Mg ha−1. The revised soil mass of the second layer was 585.10 Mg ha−1, 517.69 Mg ha−1, and 530.01 Mg ha−1 for RT, ZT, and forest land, respectively.
