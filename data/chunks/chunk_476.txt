5 t/ha), multiple stresses (drought, disease and insect pest) tolerant with desirable cooking quality traits and high micronutrients i.e., zinc (23.1 ppm) and iron (11.8 ppm) contents. It is resilient to changes in rainfall distribution. This variety showed desirable quality parameters like high head rice recovery (68.4%), intermediate amylose content (22.32%), alkali spreading value (ASV=4.0) and a soft GC with very occasionally chalky and medium slender grain type indicating good cooking quality. This variety possesses semi-erect flag leaf, medium slender grain, long and well exerted compact panicle, moderate tillering (8-10 tillers/hill) with test weight of 24.3 g. Target areas for cultivation Rice variety Swarna Sukha Dhan is primarily targeted for cultivation under direct seeded condition in drought prone rainfed midland to upland ecology of the state of Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. It can also be cultivated in water limiting irrigated areas of eastern states where rainfall is inadequate to sustain the rice production. Yield potential and agronomic adaptation Rice genotype RCPR 16 (Swarna Sukha Dhan) was entered as IET 24692 under rainfed upland trial (early duration) in AICRP coordinated program during wet season of 2014. For three years (2014-2016) of national testing in AICRIP program, this variety produced an average yield of 3.58 t/ha under early direct seeded trials (normal condition) and showed yield gain of 18.6, 29 and 24 over the national (Sahbhagi Dhan), zonal and local checks varieties, respectively. Whereas, under drought condition, this variety produced an average yield of 2.833 t/ha and showed yield gain of 17.6, 23.6 and 42.7% over national (Sahbhagi Dhan), zonal and local checks varieties, respectively (Table 1). In addition, during three years (2017-2019) of testing under the Sate Varietal Trials (Uttar Pradesh) under rainfed condition, Swarna Sukha Dhan has recorded an overall mean grain yield 1.915 t/ha and showed superiority yield advantage of 11.48 and 19.63% over NDR 97 (best check) and Shusk Samrat (local check) respectively (Table 2). Additionally, based on three years (2018-2020) of testing under State Varietal Trials (Jharkhand), Swarna Sukha Dhan has recorded an overall mean grain yield 4.344 t/ha and showed yield advantage of 6.69, 4.96 and 16.31% over Sahbhagi Dhan, Lalat and IR 64 (drt 1), respectively. Under on- station (Jharkhand) trial, IET 24692 has recorded an overall mean grain yield 4.73 t/ha and showed yield gain of 9.74% over check variety Sahbhagi Dhan. In addition, under two-year adaptive trial conducted in Jharkhand state, Swarna Sukha Dhan has recorded an overall mean grain yield 4.769 t/ha, showed yield gain of 10.93% over check variety Sahbhagi Dhan Swarna Sukha Dhan shows high response to fertilizer application as compared to checks.
