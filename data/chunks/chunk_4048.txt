 VRNTH-18-1, VRNTH-18-2, VRNTH-18-3, VRNTH-18-4 and VRNTH-18-5 were superior over popular private sector hybrids in terms of yielding ability in moisture deficit conditions. The identified hybrids yielded in a range of 53–59.33 t/ha. Tomato hybrids VRNTH-18-1 and VRNTH-18-2 with combined spray of SA+SNP yielded 30-47% higher than the most popular private sector hybrids being grown locally. (C) Biotechnology intervention for development of climate resilience vegetable crops Water use efficiency of AtDREB1A and BcZAT12 transgenic tomato lines: Drought tolerance has a major impact on more sustainable cropping systems worldwide, mainly in developing countries like India, where drought will likely be more prevalent and severe. Drought transgenic tomato lines containing AtDREB1A or BcZAT12 gene were developed. To compare water use efficiency (WUE) of these transgenic lines with drought tolerant tomato genotypes, AtDREB1A events (D41, D53, D76, D86, and D90), BcZAT12 events (ZAT1, ZT2, ZT5, and ZT6), non-transgenic line (WT; cv. Kashi Vishesh), drought tolerant genotypes (H88-78-1 and VRT32-1), and drought susceptible genotypes (EC520046 and EC620598) seeds were germinated. The trial was conducted in an insect proof screen house. Both the transgenic lines had significantly higher fruit yield (40% FC = 36-58% higher) and more number of fruit under drought conditions. The fruit characters of transgenic lines have higher TSS, sugar, ascorbic acid, citric acid, flavanoids, and carotenoids. The pH of transgenic fruits were lower than non-transgenic plants. Transgenic fruits were more firm than other genotypes. DREB, DT1 and DT2 fruits of stressed plants became harder. The pollen viability of transgenic lines showed higher viability under 40% field capacity moisture stress. The transgenic AtDREB1A events, 89.5 %; BcZAT12 events, 88.4%; D86 × ZT1 F1, 90.3%; DT genotypes, 72.3% and WT line, 70.7%. The above results suggested that drought tolerant AtDREB1A and BcZAT12 lines were much better adopted during 40% field capacity condition compared with other drought tolerant genotypes. Salt stress tolerant transgenic tomato seedlings– BcZAT12 gene: Abiotic stress like salinity affects tomato plant’s growth and productivity in coastal and salt prone areas. Our earlier results of BcZAT12 transformed tomato lines can withstand drought stress and heat-shock stress making these BcZAT12 transgenics of tomato useful for improving quality of tomato in heat or drought stressed regions. BcZAT12 gene under the regulatory control of the stress inducible Bclea1 promoter works in multiple stress condition. Another experiment with salt stress was applied to BcZAT12 transformed as well as control tomato seedlings by adding 50, 100 and 200 mM NaCl. Morphological, physiological and biochemical characters of transgenic and non-transgenic tomato seedlings were estimated after stress application.
