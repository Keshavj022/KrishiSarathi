 A set of 58 lines from Irrigated core panel (ICP) were multiplied and evaluated for yield attributing traits along with disease screening. ES003 and Irrigated core panel (ICP) lines are currently grown in MLT. 300 lines of Rainfed core panel 1.0 (RCP 1.0) were evaluated for yield and related components. Phenotyping of 58 lines of global rice array (GRA) completed. Seeds of RCP 1.0 were distributed among the NARES partners. IET27958 (CR 4161-4-IR14L-572) was promoted to advanced varietal trial-I (AVT1) under aerobic situation. Out of 15 lines shared under drought breeding network (DBN) -three lines were promoted to advanced yield trial. More than 200 multiple stress tolerant lines developed and identified for multilocation evaluation in 2020 kharif season for transplanted situation (Table 8). Similarly, more than 30 lines identified for better adaptability to direct seeded situation with tolerance to different stresses. ICAR-CGIAR | ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 60 A workshop was held at IRRI South Asia Regional Centre (ISARC), Varanasi with participants from different institutes in India on December 23-24 to select centres for evaluation and the next step. In 2019, IET 25640 (RCPR 22-IR84899-B-183-20-1-1-1 has been released and notified in the name of “Swarna Shakti Dhan” by CVRC, during 83rd CVRC meeting held on 4th October 2019. The variety has been recommended for the state of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. IET27958 (CR 4161-4-IR14L-572) promoted to AVT1-Aerobic. 6 entries nominated to IVT-Biofortification for high Zn and 8 entries nominated to IVT-Aerobic (from STRASA-DBN) Climate Smart Management Practices Climate Smart Management for Stress Prone Environment: Development of crop and nutrient management practices for recently released stress tolerant varieties (drought/flood/salinity/ sodicity/ anaerobic germination) was undertaken. It has been established that under salinity, higher K dose- 60 kg/ha promotes for better K+/Na+ homeostasis. 25% cost saving on fertilizers through microbial inoculants (25% RDF replaced with Halo Azo + Halo PSB + Halo Zn) has been identified. For water management, 56% irrigation water saving in surface drip- 0.73 kg/m3 IWP. Straw mulch was found better than black plastic (13% & 3% higher IWP at 8 & 6 dS/m, respectively). Rice-Fallow: Pulse cluster demonstrations with improved cultivation practices were conducted in 23 districts covering 2528.27 hectare (ha) area during rabi 2018-19 and 2500 ha in rabi 2019-20; Green gram: VIRAT (IPM 205-7), Sikha (IPM 410-3), IPM 2-14, IPM 02-3, MH-421; Black gram: PU-31, VBN-8 and Azad. Adaptive trials conducted with improved pulse cultivars covering ~210 ha in stress prone districts during 2018-19 and 2019-20. Multi- Institutional Trials with collaborations of CGIAR organizations (CIP, ICARDA, ICRISAT and IRRI as lead) in Rice-Fallow targeting with five different crops were conducted (Table 9).
