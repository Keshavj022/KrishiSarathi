3 g per capita per day. By 2047, in a 'Viksit Bharat', the vegetable requirement is projected to be about 403 million tonnes for an estimated population of 1.7 billion. Therefore, in a short span of 20 years, vegetable production must increase by 200 million tonnes from the present production of 212.54 million tonnes. To achieve this quantum leap in production, concentrated efforts are required for both horizontal and vertical expansion of vegetable productivity. Vertical expansion will stem from productivity increases, while horizontal expansion involves increasing the area of vegetable cultivation by integrating vegetable varieties into different cropping systems. Fruits and vegetables accounted for over `3.9 trillion in the Indian economy during the fiscal year 2021. Vegetables are the largest single sub-sector of agriculture, contributing about 27% to the gross value added (GVA) of crops. India is endowed with a diverse climate that supports the cultivation of a wide variety of vegetables, ranging from temperate to tropical, and from sea level to the snowline. More than 70 types of vegetables are grown across the country, generating high income and Indian Farming 74 (10): 10-13; October 2024 Indian Farming 11 October 2024 employment, especially for small farmers, particularly in peri-urban areas. Moreover, most vegetables, being short-duration crops, fit well into multiple and inter- cropping systems, offering high yields and economic returns in a short period of time. These crops also generate on-farm and off-farm employment. In recent years, major emphasis has been placed on the commercial exploitation of vegetable crops. Various vegetable crop varieties with specialty traits and different durations, suitable for sowing at different times, have been developed recently, allowing growers to incorporate vegetable crops into various intensive cropping systems. There is ample scope to increase vegetable production in the country. Most vegetables, if properly cultivated, can yield higher outputs than many cereal crops. Farmers engaged in vegetable production often earn higher incomes than those producing cereal crops alone. Vegetables like eggplant, radish, cabbage, cauliflower, and pumpkin yield returns at least three times higher than rice. Additionally, economic returns in terms of domestic resource cost at export parity indicate a comparative advantage for vegetable production in India. Declining profitability has compelled farmers to diversify their existing traditional cropping systems by introducing new crops to increase income through maximizing land use. Diversification currently aims to increase productivity by introducing alternative vegetables, field crops, fruit crops, flowers, and other options into rotations. Ideally, however, diversification should also aim to improve diet diversity and nutritional balance for farm families and the local population that relies on them.
