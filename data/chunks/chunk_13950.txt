Blessing of geography: Impact of geographical indications on agricultural exports in India Manu Bansala,*, Rahul Singhb a Indian Institute of Management Jammu, Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, India b Ahmedabad University, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India Received 31 January 2023; revised form 3 October 2023; accepted 17 October 2024; Available online 23 October 2024 Abstract We examine the effect of geographical indications (GIs) on India’s agricultural exports. We combine a novel dataset of state-product-year level exports with data on registered GIs for agricultural products in India from 2004 to 2016. Our identiﬁcation strategy relies on exploiting the within-state-product variation in exports over time in response to GI registration. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant positive effect of GIs on agricultural exports. We also observe that this increase is driven by government-owned GIs, and by GIs in states with more efﬁcient courts and better transport infrastructure. Finally, we ﬁnd a shift in cropping pattern, especially towards the GI-tagged crops, albeit at the district level. © 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Indian Institute of Management Bangalore.
