 From three year study of cropping system diversification through vegetables under low midland conditions, it can be concluded that including one to two vegetable crops in the cropping system for diversification is agronomically feasible and economically profitable in the Indo-Gangetic plains. The inclusion of vegetable crops in the system significantly increased gross returns, total costs, net return margins, and the B:C ratio. Cropping intensity and system productivity were sharply improved. Additionally, the increased production of seasonal and off-season vegetables generated more employment opportunities for both male and female labourers. This approach ensures food and nutritional security for farmers and the nation as a whole. *Corresponding author email: skscprs@gmail.com Table 1.
