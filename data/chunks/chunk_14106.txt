The combination of machine learning models with hydrological and agricultural studies may be useful to establish a foundation for advanced modelling and predic­ tion techniques, which may intern serve as a framework for identical investigations in other environmental areas like groundwater contami­ nation and wastewater management. Finally, this study may offer vital information for administrators to create efficient water-use rules and regulations for sustainable water resource utilization, especially in areas experiencing water scarcity. 4. Conclusions A modern approach for predicting irrigation water quality on basis of water quality parameters for irrigation in machine learning. In the present region (Arjunanadi River basin), 94 groundwater samples are taken from bore wells and dug wells to use machine learning models to forecast the suitability of water quality for irrigation practices. The primary goal of the research is to integrates machine learning models into water quality prediction, effectively connecting conventional evaluation strategies with contemporary computational methods and determine which prediction model is more effective in predicting irri­ gation water quality. Nearly 3 %, 25 %, 30 %, 48 %, 40 %, 94 %, and 60 % samples of groundwater surpass the limits of TDS, Ca, Mg, HCO3, Cl, Na, and K, respectively, prescribed for irrigational practices. Among the water quality parameters for irrigation, 10 %, 6 %, 6 %, 17 %, and 13 % samples of groundwater are not suitable for irrigation purposes on the basis of SAR, %NA, RSC, KI, and MHR, respectively. On the basis USSL, Wilcox and Doneen classifications, 9 %, 23 %, and 14 % of groundwater samples are unsuitable for irrigation practices, respectively, In the IWQI, severe restrictions and higher restrictions are seen in areas of 18.5 km2 (19 % of samples) and 395 km2 (15 %), respectively, suggesting avoiding using this water for irrigation or selecting plants with high tolerance and regular watering with high frequency practices to increase the suitability of irrigation. ML models performed with an accuracy of 97 % by SVM and 77 % by KNN model. SVM performed well than the KNN prediction model (SVM > KNN) in evaluating the performance of prediction models using model error (RSR = 0.02, NSE = 0.97, MAPE = 1.31, and R2 = 0.
