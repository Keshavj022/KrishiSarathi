25% (after 7 days of second spray) has been recommended. Diagnosis of viruses in potato: A protocol to extract high-quality RNA from polysaccharide-rich tissues of potato tuber, i.e. sprouts and periderm was standardized by slightly modifying the protocol by addition of high salt buffer. The modified protocol can be utilized for RT- LAMP based detection of PSTVd directly from the tubers. One step reverse transcriptase-recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays were developed for accurate detection of potato virus X and potato virus S in potato leaves as well as in potato tubers. Comparison of sensitivity of detection revealed that RT-RPA could detect the PVX up to 10-5 dilution of the total RNA while of maize/sorghum as border crop in the main field along with sliver agrimulch sheet + rotational spray of insecticides (Acephate @ 1.5 g/l + neem oil @ 2.0 ml/l) + (Fipronil @ 1 ml/l + neem oil @ 2 ml/l) + (Imidacloprid @ 2 g/15 l + neem oil @ 2.0 ml/l) + (Cyzpyr @ 1.8 ml/ l) at 7 days interval till fruit formation has been recommended. Residual analysis of pesticides indicated that the acephate @ 1.5 g/l, fipronil @ 1 ml/l, imidacloprid @ 2 g/15 litre and cyzpyr @ 1.8 ml/l were not detected in HPLC/GLC testing. The B:C ratio varied from 1:3.1 to 1:1.9. IDM package for tomato diseases: At Coimbatore, Parbhani and Hessaraghatta, integrated management module comprising covering of nursery with 40â€“60 mesh white nylon net until transplanting, border crop with maize in main field, nursery treatment (application of Seed Pro bio-formulation) of (i) Seed priming @ 4 g/kg, (ii) soil application @ 10 g/kg of soil while potting, and (iii) soil drenching @ 5% after seed germination) and main field treatment [Seedling dip with 0.1% (Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP) + spray with Acephate 75% WP @ 1.5 g/l on 10 days after transplanting + spray with Fipronil 5% SC @ 1.5 ml/l on 20 DAT+ spray with copper hydroxide 77% WP (2.0 g/l) on 25 DAT + spray with imidacloprid 70% WG @ 2 g/15 l on 40 DAT + spray with Fenamidone 10% + Mancozeb 50% WDG (0.25%)] two to three times from 45 DAT at 10 days intervals was observed most effective in the management of tomato diseases (damping off, early blight, late blight, bud necrosis and leaf-curl disease) and maximum fruit yield. Pesticide residue analysis for this treatment revealed that pesticides were not detected. The B : C ratio varied from 1:2.5 to 1:10.3. Bio-intensive management of diseases of capsicum under protected cultivation: At Solan, treatment Diagnosis of Tomato Leaf Curl Bangalore Virus (ToLCBV) The Arka Viral Kit is based on Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) to diagnose Tomato Leaf Curl Bangalore Virus (ToLCBV). It is superior in specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity to other molecular techniques like PCR, RT-PCR, and real-time PCR. It is user friendly, as the testing can be done in a water bath or dry bath; and cost-effective compared to other PCR based diagnostic kits.
