 high valued tree circle, timber circle, plywood circle, medicinal plants, fruits circle and moringa circle. The entire multifunctional agroforestry is divided into four equal quadrats. The spacing between each circle is 5 m and each quadrat has different intercrops. Quadrat I is of flower block (Jasminum grandiflorum, Jasminum officinale), quadrat II is of vegetable block (crop selection differs for kharif and rabi), quadrat III comprises curry leaf (Murraya koenigii) and Nerium oleander, and quadrat IV is of fodder grass block, i.e. Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) and Desmanthus (Desmanthus virgatus). The model is designed in such a way that, small farmers will be able to reap benefits and income from one or the other components round the year in the range of `450–900 per Table 1.

This model not only provides monetary income but is also studied to quantify the services rendered by multiple sections (Table 1). The main benefit of using a circular model of multifunctional agroforestry is that in a limited space, maximum number of tree, crop, fodder, flower and livestock components were included to cater both sustenance and economic farming.
