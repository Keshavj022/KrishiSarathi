Therefore, it is more acceptable to utilize a regression model that assumes that the dependent variable follows a continuous distribution supporting the value between zero and one. In the literature, such regression models are now available, known as the Beta regression model (Cepeda and Gamerman, 2005; Ferrari and Cribari-Neto, 2004; Kieschnick and McCullough, 2003; Paolino, 2001). Following Carrasco et al. (2014), the beta regression model for the present study is speciﬁed, estimated, interpreted, and discussed as follows: HI ¼ ðXÞβ þ u (5) where EðHIÞ  BetaððXÞbβ; σ2 uÞ and u  Nf0; σ2 ug. Further, the marginal effect of the independent variables is interpreted and compared. The estimation is done through the statistical software STATA 13.0 edition (Bruin, 2006).

Table 3 displays the summary statistics for all the factors outlined in Table 2. A perusal of Table 3 reveals that the mean scores of HI, CSATAI, levels of social capital (LSC), agricultural expenditure (LAE), sanitation index (LSI), human development index of the household (HHDI) and land index (LLI) are 0.421, 0.464, 0.370, 0.052, 0.393, 0.074, and, 0.038 respectively, which is comparatively low. However, the average score of the households that have knowledge about CSAT is 0.818. This implies that a fairly good number of households have ideas about CSAT. The low adoption rate of the CSAT may be attributed to several factors. Fig. 5.

In fact, it shows that 31.17% of households with low levels of CSATAI ranging from 0.251 to 0.500 have low levels of happiness.
