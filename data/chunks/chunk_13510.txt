 According to recent MNRE data, almost 10170 MW grid feeding power capacity from over 800 biomass power cogeneration projects has been installed in the country (MNRE, 2022). 1.3. Scope of agricultural residue-based bioenergy production India’s economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which also provides the majority of the country’s jobs. Approximately 70% of rural households in the nation still significantly rely on agriculture for a living, with 82% of those farmers being small and marginal. Only 17.5% of India’s GDP comes from agriculture, despite a sizable population (PRS, 2022). In India, 275 MT of food grains were expected to be produced in 2017–18. India is the world’s top producer of jute and pulses, while it ranks second in the production of wheat, rice, cotton, sugarcane, and ground- nuts (FAO, 2022). As a result, India produces a large amount of agricultural residue each year, which can potentially be used for bioenergy generation. Many studies have discussed the na- tional potential of crop residues in India, policies, and technolo- gies related to their conversion into bioenergy (Hiloidhari et al., 2014; Hiloidhari and Baruah, 2011; Kothari et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2015). Ravindranath et al. (2005) discussed the potential of efficient energy production from animal manure, crop residue, municipal solid waste, industrial wastewater and biomass. They estimated a potential energy generation of 5.14 EJ from all the mentioned feedstock in 1997. Purohit (2009) estimated a total of 74 MT agricultural residues for feedstock towards an efficient gasification process to generate energy in India. In a similar study, Hiloidhari et al. (2014) estimated 686 MT of gross crop residue in India, out of which 34% (234 MT) was found as surplus residue. They also estimated a potential annual bioenergy production of 4.15EJ, which was equivalent to 17% total primary energy consumption of India. Cardoen et al. (2015) also discussed and assessed the potential availability of agri-residues in India in 3773 T.J. Deka, A.I. Osman, D.C. Baruah et al. Energy Reports 9 (2023) 3771–3786 2010. They estimated a total of 760.055 MT of gross residue pro- duction considering 21 different crops. Usmani (2020) has tried to estimate the potential for energy and biofuel production in India from energy crops and agroforestry residues. He estimated 432.020 MT of surplus crop residue potential in India. However, agricultural practices, as well as previous climatic conditions, influence the availability and distribution of agricul- tural residues. Because modern conversion technologies are mak- ing biofuel production more popular, India’s agricultural residues have a high biofuel production capability.
