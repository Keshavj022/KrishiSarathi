 Though the total number of tillers and the length of panicles were not significantly different for the treated and the untreated sewage water irrigated plots, yet the total number of unproductive tillers and unfilled seeds per panicle were observed to be significantly higher in the sewage water irrigated paddy crop. These differences were not very evident in case of wheat crop, due to its relatively lower water-demand. However, number of tillers infected with termites and fungi in both wheat and paddy crops were observed to be higher in the sewage water irrigated plots. Because of considerable lead >> iron > nickel ~ Manganese - contamination in the long-term sewage irrigated site of IARI, the agricultural produce from such plots was found to be totally unsuitable for human consumption (Fig. 2). However, as illustrated in Fig.2, these risks could be considerably reduced over years through continuous irrigations with the proposed technology based treated waters. Long term continuous application of treated waters, in place of the untreated sewage water irrigations were observed to result in significant reductions in both total and bio-available soil -nickel, lead and iron concentrations (Fig. 3). Soil bio-available chromium also decreased from an initial level of 5.71 ± 0.88 mg/kg to 1.57 ± 0.07 mg/kg within two years. Thus, continuous irrigations with treated waters resulted in significantly improved soil / crop - health and food quality.
