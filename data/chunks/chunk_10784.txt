 The period between harvesting of wheat crop and transplanting of rice crop (May-June) can be utilized for growing of green manure crops. Dhaincha (Sesbania sesban) is very suitable cover crop which can be grown for green manuring. Sowing of dhaincha @30 kg seed/ ha is done in first week of May. The crop is ploughed up in 3rd week of June (45-50 DAS). Transplanting of rice is done after one week of ploughing of dhaincha crop. Apply 2/3rd dose of NPK fertilizers in fields where green manuring is done. Water Conservation practices   Transplanting of rice requires huge volume of water. It can be saved by bringing change in planting method of the crop. Direct seeding of rice crop has been found very successful technology and is helpful in conservation of water resources.   Levelling of fields with laser Level Machine helps in water saving in transplanting conditions.

Currently increase the quantity of wheat chaff and Jowar in the feed.   Give dairy animals a balanced feed so that their milk production capacity is enhanced.   Deworming of animals should be carried out.   Maize, perennial grasses and other fodder species should be harvested now.   Sheep should be sheared during this month.
