The rapid advancement of smart sensor technologies has transformed the landscape of precision agriculture, ushering in a new era of data-driven and sustainable farming practices. This study presents a comprehensive review of recent innovations and future perspectives in the domain of smart sensors for precision agriculture. By harnessing the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence, these sensors have revolutionized how farmers collect, analyze, and utilize data to optimize crop yield, conserve resources, and enhance overall agricultural efﬁciency. The review delves into various types of smart sensors used in precision agriculture, including soil sensors for monitoring moisture, nutrient levels, and soil health; crop health sensors for detecting diseases, pests, and stress factors; weather and environmental sensors for real-time climate monitoring; and automated irrigation systems for precise water management. Cutting-edge technologies such as drone-based sensors, hyperspectral imaging, and sensor fusion are explored, highlighting their potential to revolutionize data acquisition and decision-making in agriculture. Furthermore, the manuscript addresses the incorporation of smart sensors with data analysis systems. This enables farmers to acquire practical observations and render knowledgeable choices regarding watering schedules, fertilizing regimens, and safe- guarding approaches for crops. The role of data-driven agriculture in mitigating environmental impact, optimizing resource utilization, and promoting sustainable practices is emphasized. Despite the signiﬁcant strides made in smart sensor technology, challenges such as sensor calibration, data privacy, interoperability, and adoption barriers remain pertinent. To address these hurdles, the manuscript outlines potential research directions and emerging trends in sensor development, including miniaturiza- tion, energy efﬁciency, and wireless communication advancements. In conclusion, this manuscript provides a comprehensive assessment of the recent advancements and future prospects of smart sensors in precision agriculture.
