 Improved varieties: For irrigated conditions: HC-1, HC- 3, HC- 5, CSJ-515, GNG- 2144, GNG-2171 For rainfed conditions: HC- 1, RSG-501. Seed rate: Use seed quantity according to size of seed of the varieties. Use 40 kg seed/ ha of small seed size, 60 kg/ ha of medium seed size and 80 kg/ ha of bold seed size varieties. Seed treatment: Seed treatment with chloropyriphos 20 EC (1500 ml/100 kg seed) is advised for management of termite. Prepare 2.0-liter solution of water of above insecticides and treat 1.0 q ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 119 seed. Now treat the seed with carbendazim (2.5 g/ kg seed) or trichoderma viridi (4g) + vitavex (1g/ kg seed). Sowing: Sowing with pora method in rows at 30 cm spacing and at 10 cm depth is advised. Crop sown at shallow depth is likely to be affected by wilt disease. Keep spacing of 45 cm between rows for sowing of the crop under rainfed conditions. Nutrient management: Apply 15 kg N (30-35 kg urea) and 40 kg P2O5 (250 kg SSP or 80-90 kg DAP)/ha before sowing of the crop and use 25 Kg ZnSO4 in light textured soils. Inoculate seed with rhizobium and PSB culture before Sowing. Plant protection: Wilt, root rot and alternaria blight are main disease of chickpea crop which affect crop yield adversely. It is advised not to do sowing of crop before 10th October for management of wilt disease. Treatment of seed as mentioned earlier should also be done for management of wilt disease. Root rot disease is also managed by the seed treatment practice adopted for management. Cultivation of disease tolerant/ resistant varieties is advised to manage alternaria blight disease November Month Two hoeing-weeding at 25-30 DAS and 45-50 DAS are required for getting good crop yield. December Month Apply irrigation before flowering as per crop need. Brown spot on the leaf indicate the deficiency of zinc, therefore, it is advised to apply 25 kg ZnSO4/ ha before sowing of the next crop. Sometimes pod borer appears in December month and causes damage to leaves and flowers. For management of pod borer, spray 1-liter quinalphos 25 EC or 200 ml fenvalret 20 EC or 125 ml cypermetharin 25 EC or 375 ml novaluron 10 EC in 375-liter water/ ha. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 120 January Month Where irrigation facilities are available, apply irrigation at 45-60 DAS. February Month Pod borer attack may be possible in some areas for management of pod borer spray 1-liter quinalphos 25 EC or 200 ml fenvalret 20 EC or 125 ml cypermetharin 25 EC or 375 ml novaluron 10 EC in 375-liter water/ ha. Do monitoring of crop for alterneria blight disease especially in moist cold weather, remove the affected plants. Wheat November Month Time of sowing: Sowing of the crop at optimum time is an important factor contributing to crop yield. Optimum time of sowing for irrigated crop is from 25th October to 15th November. Under limited irrigation conditions sowing should be done from last week of October to first week of November.
