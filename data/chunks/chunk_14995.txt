 It also requires international cooperation to en- sure investment in infrastructure and technology to improve agri- cultural productivity ( UNDP, 2016 ). Under-nutrition can begin during conception and can have a lasting effect throughout life, especially in girls and women. Con- ception to 2 years age offers a unique opportunity to reduce the effect of under-nutrition in children with appropriate nutri- tional interventions.

As under-nutrition in early years affects the entire life span of a human being, it is important to explore the food security vulner- ability among children. Underweight is one of the key indicators of health among chil- dren under the age of ﬁve ( < 5 years). High prevalence of under- weight children poses serious health issues for any country. As per the fourth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) data for children under the age of ﬁve, the national average for under- weight prevalence is 36% ( NFHS 2016 ). More than 35% of the chil- dren in 11 out of 29 states are underweight ( < −2SD, based on WHO standard) ( NFHS, 2016 ), which is 43% of the total (0–6 years) underweight children in India. High food insecurity and low diet diversity in the households (HHs), due to socio-economic status, are the chief reason for the current underweight status as around 40% of the population is food insecure ( Tandon and Landes, 2014 ; Chandrasekhar et al., 2017 ). NFHS-4 reports the national average percentage for wasting, stunting, and diarrhoea to be 21%, 38% and 9%, respectively. More than half (58%) of the children in this age group are anaemic (i.e., haemoglobin < 11.0 g/dl). The indicators of child health for India are higher than for the neighbouring coun- tries including Sri Lanka (wasting 15.1%, stunting 17.3%, diarrhoea 3% in 2016) and Bangladesh (wasting 14.3%, stunting 36.1%, diar- rhoea 6% in 2014) ( BDHS 2014 ; World Bank Database, 2019 ). Under-nutrition adversely affects human capital and economic productivity, and increases susceptibility to disease, especially in the early phase of life ( FAO, 1992 ; World Bank, 2005 ; Nandi et al., 2017 ).
