 If the field is deficient in micronutrients, then it is applied as per requirement. The full dose of phosphorous and potash as well as 1/3 dose of nitrogen should be applied at the time of sowing. Another 1/3 dose of nitrogen is applied at first irrigation i.e. at the time of crown root initiation stage (21-24 DAS) and remaining 1/3 dose is applied at the time of second irrigation (50-55 DAS). Another 25% of nitrogen is applied additionally after cutting of green fodder as it stimulates regrowth. Water management Irrigation management of dual- purpose wheat is almost similar to normally grown wheat. Pre-sowing irrigation should be given to check proper germination. After that, first irrigation should to be given at the crown root initiation stage i.e., at 21 DAS. Second irrigation is to be given at 50-55 DAS as per climatic conditions and soil requirements. Third irrigation is given 4-6 days after harvesting of green fodder. Additional two irrigations are given at the flowering stage and grain filling stage. Fig. 2.

Overview of the experimental field. Indian Farming 13 October 2023 Weed management Pendimethalin @ 1250-1500 g per ha is applied at 0-2 DAS as pre- emergence for initial weed control in dual-purpose wheat. Post-emergent herbicides should be avoided as the crop is harvested as green fodder for animal purposes. Post-emergent herbicides may leave residue as there is less time interval between herbicide application and fodder cutting. It can be applied after fodder harvesting depending on the type of weed flora present in the field. Some of the post-emergence herbicides recommended are sulfosulfuron + metsulfuron 25+4 or its ready mixture 30+2 g/ha or application of clodinafop 60 g/ha or pinoxaden 50 g/ha or metsulfuron 4 g/ha. Fodder harvesting Timely harvesting of green fodder is necessary for re-growth and production of grains. The optimum time for harvesting of green fodder is 55-65 DAS. Before this time, harvesting leads to poor yield and beyond this time, it leads to poor regeneration of crop. The crop should be harvested above 10 cm from ground level by using a sickle to ensure faster growth in pre reproductive stage. The average green fodder yield of dual-purpose wheat is 8-10 t/ha. Care after green fodder harvesting As the crop is cut for green fodder, it leads to the loss of crop biomass which is very necessary for photosynthesis. So first we need to recover the tillers and leaves of the plants. Almost 30-40 kg/ha of nitrogen is lost in the form of green fodder. So, to recover this amount, an additional dose of 30-40 kg of nitrogen is added after green fodder harvesting. This should be applied between 5-7 days after harvesting. Also, one irrigation should be given.
