3 tonnes/ha, respectively. Farmers accepted the machine for timeliness of operation and higher output. The machine was used on 13 farmers’ fields covering a total area of 34.25 ha. At NDUAT, Faizabad a 2-row tractor-mounted semi-automatic belt type potato planter with fertilizer placement device was tested for its feasibility. The system required total of 4 persons for its continuous operation, one for operating the tractor with machine, two sitting on the machine for removing excess tubers, filling vacant cups and one for carrying and filling tubers and fertilizers in the machine during Source-wise classification of accidents in agriculture Source Per cent of total accidents due to various sources Madhya Pradesh Orissa Tamil Nadu Farm tools and machinery-related accidents Tractors 46.1 8.4 27.4 Power tillers - 2.3 - Animal-drawn puddlers - 3.1 - Threshers 14.5 0.8 18.2 Electric motors and pump sets 7.9 6.9 - Sprayer 2.6 12.2 25.7 Spade/ pickaxe 1.3 9.2 3.0 Sickle 10.5 6.1 6.7 Chaff cutters 4.0 0.8 5.9 Cane crusher - 0.8 11.8 Winnower - 0.8 - Rice hullers/grain mill 2.6 7.6 - Other tools and machinery 1.3 6.0 - Sub-total 90.8 65.0 98.7 Accidents related to other sources Snake/animal bites 5.2 14.4 1.3 Fall in wells 4.0 - - Lightning - 11.4 - Sun stroke - 9.2 - Sub-total 9.2 35.0 1.3 Total 100 100 100 DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 136 operation. The machine was demonstrated in 26 ha area on different farmers’ fields. Potato planter saved 77 m-days/ha in earthing, 28 m-days/ha in interculture and 98 m-days/ha in seeding operation in comparison to conventional method. Light Weight Power Tiller The RAU, Pusa Centre of AICRP on FIM carried out prototype feasibility testing of light weight power tiller for interculture operation in sugarcane, maize, tobacco and vegetable. The lightweight power tiller was found suitable for weeding with 40 cm rotavator and cutter wheel (other available size was 80 cm). The interculture operation was conducted in 9 ha area of sugarcane, 4.5 ha area of maize and 2 ha area of tobacco. There was a net saving of approx. Rs 1,000/ha with the use of lightweight power tiller in comparison to the traditional method of interculture. Timeliness of the operation was another beneficial factor. Sugar mill authorities have distributed 5 units of light weight power tiller to the cane growers of the region after seeing its demonstration. Aeroblast Sprayer Feasibility testing of a tractor-mounted aeroblast sprayer was carried out by PAU Centre of AICRP on FIM on cotton crop. The machine is useful for spraying on horticultural plants and tall crops like cotton and sunflower. Field capacity of the machine varied from 2 to 3 ha/hr. Droplets were deposited on both sides of the leaf due to air blast. A total area of 12.5 ha was covered with the machine during prototype feasibility testing by the PAU, Ludhiana Centre. The farmers of 10 villages surveyed, used it for 3,484 ha (in cotton crop 6-7 times spraying is done).
