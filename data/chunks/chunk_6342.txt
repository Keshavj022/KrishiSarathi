Crop Improvement CROPS Crop varieties released and notified Since 1965, more than 6,000 improved field crops varieties (6,226) have been developed which include 3,059 of cereals, 1,021 of oilseeds, 1,136 of pulses, 250 of forage crops, 553 of fiber crops, 157 of sugarcane and 50 of potential crops. During the reporting period, a total of 283 varieties/hybrids have been notified and released for commercial cultivation, which include 35 biofortified varieties and 32 varieties to combat the various abiotic stresses like drought, water scarcity, flood, waterlogging, salinity, sodicity, low temperature etc. Use of precision breeding tools, i.e. marker assisted selection has also been done in breeding 10 traits specific varieties.
