 National Repository of Fish Cell lines with 81 cell line accessions is also located in this museum. Crop Management: Legume integration with cereals has proved superior in productivity and beneficial to the environment. Temporal integration of maize + blackgram (raised bed) + soybean (furrow)- chickpea (raised bed) + wheat (furrow) (3:2)-greengram (raised bed) + sunflower (furrow) (5:1) was found economically feasible by recording higher productive efficiency (175%) concerning maize-wheat systems with the lowest greenhouse gases intensity (GHGI). An IFS model (1-acre area) consisting of polyhouse cultivation of vegetables (600 m2 area for cultivation of tomato, capsicum, and cucumbers), mushroom production (50 m2 area), agri-horti system (1,200 m2 area), apiculture and open field cultivation of vegetables, flowers, cereals, oilseeds and pulses on 2,200 m2 area was developed for small and marginal farmers. The IFS model is economically efficient and environmentally robust and has the potential to generate a net income of 1,75,650 per year. A sugarcane cultivation model combining nine improved sugarcane cultivation practices named as Sugarcane Settling Transplanting Technology (STT) was established at ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore. Four full length vip3-type genes, viz. vip3Aa44, vip3Aa67, vip3Aa69 and vip3Aa70 (NCBI GenBank Accession Numbers HQ650163, MN120477, MN120479 and MN120481, respectively) were isolated from Bt subsp thuringiensis (A6) and Bt isolates SK-792, SK-986 and SK-851, recovered from diverse habitats in India. These vip3Aa genes have potential for lepidopteran pest control. A pool of 373 entopathogenic fungal isolates (EPFs) was evaluated for their bioefficacy against whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) under polyhouse. Overall, EPF strains Beauveria bassiana (Bb)-4511, Cordyceps javanica (Cj)-102, and Metarhizium anisopliae (Ma)-1299, were found compatible with full and half doses of the chemical and botanicals and showed highest nymphal mortality (80-95%). A Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) inducer molecule was developed as coated nano formulation for smart delivery in plants, for prolonged release and tested for its plant immune inducer property in field against red rot, smut and wilt diseases of OVERVIEW ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 4 sugarcane. In field experiments, application of nano formulation significantly reduced red rot, smut and wilt incidences by 79.4%, 80.8% and 75.8%, respectively over pathogen inoculated control. The mango-based cropping system with dragon fruit and pineapple as component crops exhibited higher production efficiency (85.21 kg/day/ha), economic efficiency and sustainable yield index under Bhubaneswar conditions. Spray schedule for flower/fruit drop in pomegranate was standardized. An integrated nutrient management schedule in sweet orange was standardized.
