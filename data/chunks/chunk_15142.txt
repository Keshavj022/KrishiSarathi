 Therefore, the impact of non-agricultural income on the adoption of MI technologies shows both positive and negative effects (Namara et al., 2007). The study also found a positive correlation between landholding size, access to irrigation, and the adoption of irrigation technologies. Farm size, as a measure of wealth, can positively influence the adoption of MI technologies due to greater resources (NCAP, 2019). However, this impact can turn negative if certain technologies are not suitable for Table 4 Variables used in the probit regression model and their descriptions.
