 DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 38 Seedlings from sugarcane fluff in the mist chamber Sugarcane varieties released for commercial cultivation Variety Area of Cane yield Sucrose Maturity Reaction against adaptation (tonnes/ha) (%) group disease Co 89029 Eastern Uttar 70.62 16.29 Early Moderately (GANDAK) Pradesh, Bihar, resistant to West Bengal red-rot CoSe 95422 Eastern Uttar 67.78 17.66 Early Moderately (RASBHARI) Pradesh, Bihar, resistant to West Bengal red-rot and smut CoSe 92423 Eastern Uttar 70.11 17.50 Mid late Moderately (RAJBHOG) Pradesh, Bihar, resistant to West Bengal red-rot Co 86032 sugarcane is grown in wide rows of 150 cm, and is recommended for cultivation in the iron-deficient soils been planted with 402 clones, comprising Co canes (87), state clones (263), HR types (2), ISH types (30), foreign hybrids (16) and miscellaneous (4). A total of 114 mericlones flasks have been supplied to sugar factories of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Crop Production Linseed Garima, which required 46 kg N/ha as top-dressing, intercropped in autumn sugarcane CoS 95255 at 75 cm was quite remunerative, as linseed yield of 1.5 tonnes/ha generated Rs 15,000/ha as mid-season income. Co 86032 and Co 8021 sugarcane were recommended for cultivation in iron- deficient soils. Carbendazim at 0.025% gave maximum control of smut at the majority of the locations. Sprouting of setts and cane yield improved with this. Tilt (0.2%) and Bayleton (0.2%) also effectively controlled smut disease. CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 39 Crop Protection Indirect-ELISA technique has been standardized for diagnosis of sugarcane ratoon stunting disease bacterium. The technique was sensitive to asymptomatic sugarcane stalks. Laboratory parasitization rates of Sturmiopsis inferens on shoot-borer by Scaramuzza technique gave been generally higher than those noticed by King’s method. JUTE AND ALLIED FIBRES Crop Improvement A new high-yielding tossa jute JRO 128 has been developed from a cross between TJ6 and Tanganyika 1, and has been released for general cultivation. It is recommended for sowing in mid-March without the risk of early flowering and can be accommodated in multiple cropping system. The variety produces stronger (26- 29 g/tex) and fine quality fibres (2.0-2.5 tex) of TD2 grade. Tan/X/087 and JRO 524 for fibre percentage, JRO 3352 for base diameter and stick weight and JRO 878 for plant height and stick weight have been identified as good general combiners. Hybrids from Selection 2 × JRO 878, JRO 52 × JRO 524, JRO 52 × JRO 878, KEN/SM/004 × JRO 524 and KEN/SM/024 × JRO 878 have showed positive and numerically higher specific combining abilities, which are carried forward. In mesta (Hibiscus sabdariffa) in advance varietal trial-II, AMT (3.0 tonnes/ha) and AM 4 (2.85 tonnes/ha) outyielded best check at the CRIJAF, and at Amadalavalasa (Andhra Pradesh), AHS 85 (3.61 tonnes/ha) was promising. In Sunnhemp, IET SH 12 recorded a very high yield of 2.
