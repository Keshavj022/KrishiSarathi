 A healthy diet plays a key role in improving mental health (i.e. concentration, alertness, and problem-solving skills) among children ( Angelsen et al., 2001 ; Vazir and Boindala, 2016 ). A large gap exists between the intake of micronutrients such as iron (a contributing factor to anaemia) in diet and physiological need (i.e., recommended dietary allowance) among children (refer to Fig. 2 ) across all surveyed states in the country ( NNMB, 2012 ). This gap plays a key role in hindering the growth of a child and thereby acts as a major threat to nutrition security in India. Fig. 1.

Average consumption of iron (mg/day) by children of age 1–3 years and 4–6 years (2011–2012). Nutirtion status is further threatened by climate change. The nutrient density of the agricultural produce (crop yields) is directly linked to the nutritional value of diet, which is adversely affected by climate change ( Asif et al., 2017 ; Soares et al., 2019 ; Rao et al., 2018a ; Jin et al., 2019 ). The impact of climate change on crop yields and the direct impact of crop yields on childhood under- nutrition, especially acute under-nutrition, are well documented ( UNICEF, 2011 ; Phalkey et al., 2015 ; Asif et al., 2017 ; Soares et al., 2019 ; Rao et al., 2018b ; Jin et al., 2019 ). Besides, climate change may also encourage weed and pest proliferation which result in a further decline in agricultural production. Agriculture is vulnerable to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide, temperature, rainfall, and salinity, thus affecting nutrition through reduced food and nutrition security ( Lal, 2002 ). Atmo- spheric CO 2 is the main cause of increase in the earth’s temper- ature and rainfall, which are the two most determining global fac- tors of climate change. Greenhouse gas emission changes the micronutrient levels in grains as well as their bioavailability in soil. Increased carbon diox- ide in atmosphere leads to an increase in carbon assimilation in plants as compared to mineral intake by them. This reduces the micronutrient level in food crops such as wheat, rice, legumes, and vegetables ( Soares et al., 2019 ; Rao et al., 2018a ). These food crops come under C3 plant category, meaning their carbon assim- ilation during photosynthesis is governed by the less energy eﬃ- cient C3 cycle. The two major C3 crops (wheat and rice) which make essential part of nutrition in vegetarian diets are the sta- ple foods in India. These are more sensitive to climate change ( Rao et al., 2018a ; Soares et al., 2019 ) as compared to the C4 plants (e.g., maize, millets, etc.) ( Rao et al., 2018a ). The Intergovernmen- tal Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report published in 2007 es- timates that a 0.5 ᵒ C rise in winter temperature is likely to reduce wheat yield by 0.45 tonnes per hectare in India.
