 As the currently cultivated cultivar Co 238 suffers from many issues, hence there is a need to find out a suitable alternative that must be popularized among the cane farmers for maintaining the potential yields and recovery. CoPb 95 is that alternative early maturing and high-yielding cane cultivar which reportedly suffers from lesser attacks of insect pests and diseases, reduces the overall cost of cultivation and improves the livelihoods of cane farmers. Keywords: Cane yield, CoPb 95, Punjab, Recovery, Sugarcane S UGARCANE growers in Punjab are looking for early maturing cultivars due to the Punjab sugar mills’ short crushing schedule. Moreover, the susceptibility of the renowned sugarcane variety Co 238 to red rot disease is a source of concern for the industry as well as the state’s sugarcane growers. During 2019–20, the state sugar industry was handled by 16 sugar mills (9 cooperatives + 7 private), with a total sugarcane demand of 96 thousand hectares, producing 730 lakh quintals and productivity of 802 q/ha. The major goal of maturity- based cultivar classification is to make it easier to harvest varieties at the right time to improve overall recovery and, as a result, sugar production. When a sugarcane variety reaches above 17% sucrose and 85% purity of cane juice at the age of 8–10 months, it is called early maturing. Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, Punjab developed CoPb 95, an early maturing sugarcane variety, for sugarcane Indian Farming 73 (05): 32-34; May 2023 growers in the state of Punjab in 2021. This variety was developed at the National Hybridization Garden, Sugarcane Breeding Institute Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu from a poly cross of CoLk 8102, and recognized at Regional Research Station, PAU, Kapurthala, Punjab where it was tested for years at the research station and other sites before being released. This variety was produced in comparison to CoPb 92, a recent local release, and Co 238, a popular variety. Perusal of Table 1 reveals the field performance of CoPb 95 for its cane yield (t/ha), components traits, viz. cane length (cm), cane diameter (cm), single cane weight (kg), number of millable canes (000/ ha), sugar yield (t/ha), commercial cane sugar (CCS) (%), sucrose (%), purity (%) followed by insect pests and disease attacks. The mean cane yield of CoPb 95 was 95.06 t/ha, which was 14.56% greater than CoPb 92 (82.67 t/ha) and 10.73% higher than the popular variety Co 238 (85.53 t/ha) based on 14 research trials (12 plant trials and 2 ratoon trials). In comparison Sugarcane production in Punjab from 1975–76 to 2019–20 Indian Farming 33 May 2023 to CoPb 92 (93.2 t/ha) and Co 238 (104.7 t/ha), CoPb 95 was evaluated in farmers’ fields during 23 adaptive trials, yielding 118 t/ha. Overall, CoPb 95 produced 106.4 t/ha cane, which is 20.71% greater than CoPb 92 and 11.86% higher than Co 238. CoPb 95 yielded 11.25 t/ha of commercial cane sugar (CCS t/ha), which was 4.71% greater than CoPb 92 (10.67 t/ha) and 6.
