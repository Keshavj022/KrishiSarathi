 First harvest can be made in 45-60 days depending on the species. The tube net method is being adopted in places with higher wave actions. It is a recent method in which long sleeves (10/25 m long and 6/10 cm dia.) made of nylon nets (1-1.5 cm mesh) are seeded with vegetative bits that appear like “net tubes”. Both the ends are then tied and allowed to float in seawater. Anchors are used at each end to hold the tube nets steady in the water column. Harvesting is generally done after 60 days. Though started in 1972, seaweed mariculture (agarophytes Gracilaria edulis and Gelidiella acerosa) in India remained in low key until the year 2000. Seaweed cultivation with native species has been shown to be beset with problems such as grazing of seed material and grown up plants by fishes, longer culture duration and slow growth rate of species like Gelidiella acerosa. Large scale, commercial sea-farming of Kappaphycus alvarezii, a kappa carrageenan yielding seaweed started in 2000 with a backup by PepsiCo India Holdings Ltd. in the coastal waters of Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Gujarat and Daman and Diu with technical support from CSIR - Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI), Bhavnagar. It is reported that with the contract farming of Kappaphycus alvarezii by the fisher folks of east coast of India, more than 46,600 tonnes wet biomass of Kappaphycus was produced in a decade during 2005 to 2015. The market price during this period found to increase Indian Farming November 2020 42 from less than ` 4.5 to 35/kg (dry weight). The present market price is about ` 50/kg (dry weight). However, the production sharply declined after 2013 due to mass mortality as a result of “ice-ice” disease and the average production of cultured Kappaphycus alvarezii in recent years is only to the tune of 200 t (dry weight)/year. At present, commercial farming is carried out following three techniques, namely floating bamboo raft, tube net (net sleeves), and long lines; of which the former two are widely practiced (Fig. 1). The economics of Kappaphycus alvarezii farming as analysed by ICAR-CMFRI is as follows: • Seaweed production: 1,000 kg/ raft/yr- 240 kg as seed material for 4 crops/yr = 760 kg • Price of seaweed: ` 8/kg (wet weight)/raft or ` 50/kg/dry weight (Dry weight = 10%) • Total revenue generated: ` 6080/ year/ raft @ ` 8/kg/wet weight • Total cost of production (including capital cost): ` 1500/ raft/yr • Net profit: ` 4580/raft/year (` 6080 minus 1500) • One family (2 person) can handle average 30 rafts (12 × 12 ft) • Total Net profit (30 rafts) in fresh weight = 30 × ` 4580 = ` 1,37,400/yr • One hectare can accommodate 400 rafts (12 ft × 12 ft) of seaweeds • Total production per ha = 760 kg × 400 rafts = 304 tonnes (wet weight) • Net profit per hectare= 4580 × 400 = ` 18,32,000/- Considerable research has been carried out on various aspects of Indian seaweeds by ICAR-CMFRI.
