 Ethylene sensors, often based on metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) technology, detect concentrations of ethylene gas emitted by ripening fruits. By integrating these sensors into storage and packing November–December 2024 47 areas, stakeholders can manage ripening schedules more effectively. Furthermore, analyzing historical data collected from these shipments can provide insights into patterns and trends that inform future logistics strategies. Predictive maintenance alerts can be generated if temperature fluctuations occur frequently, indicating potential equipment malfunctions before they lead to costly failures. Intelligent packaging solutions: By incorporating active and smart features, intelligent packaging systems can interact dynamically with their environment, ensuring that the produce remains fresh and safe for consumers. Smart packaging technologies incorporate sensors and indicators that provide real-time feedback on the condition of the produce. Time-temperature indicators (TTIs) signal if products have been exposed to temperatures outside of safe limits, changing colour when specific thresholds are exceeded. Freshness indicators monitor spoilage- related volatile organic compounds (VOCs) through E-nose and can visually indicate the decline in product quality. Furthermore, integrating QR codes or Near Field Communication (NFC) technology allows consumers to access detailed information about the product’s journey, including its origin, handling conditions, and freshness history. This level of transparency builds consumer trust and promotes accountability among retailers. IoT-enabled sensors continuously track parameters such as temperature, humidity, and gas concentrations, transmitting real-time data to cloud-based platforms for analysis. This capability allows stakeholders to respond promptly to deviations, minimizing the risk of spoilage. Additionally, the data collected can optimize supply chain logistics, enabling predictive models that anticipate potential quality issues and adjust logistics strategies accordingly. Machine Learning for decision making Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in postharvest decision-making, significantly enhancing the management of horticultural crops. By leveraging predictive models, quality assessment techniques, and defect detection algorithms, ML can optimize storage practices, improve product quality, and reduce waste, which are particularly relevant in the context of rapidly evolving agricultural markets and increasing consumer demand for high-quality produce. Predictive models for shelf-life estimation: Predictive models for shelf-life estimation utilize historical data to forecast the remaining viability of fruits and vegetables. Machine learning algorithms, such as regression analysis, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks, are employed to analyze factors influencing shelf- life, including temperature, humidity, and ethylene concentration.
