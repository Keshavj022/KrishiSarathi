 Guild-based models suggested that migratory carnivores tended to be more abundant in less diverse landscapes with a low proportion of cropland. Open-ground preferring Palearctic species were positively associated with a higher proportion of semi- perennial crops and negatively associated with woody vegetation, while shrub- breeders were positively associated with a high proportion of annual crops and woody vegetation. The effect of mean field size on resident and Palearctic migratory birds was inconclusive. We conclude that (1) winter bird assem- blages of resident and migratory species in agriculture–savanna mosaics of western India are driven more by agricultural composition than configuration; (2) resident birds adapt to the high compositional heterogeneity of smallholder Received: 17 December 2024 Accepted: 23 January 2025 DOI: 10.1002/eap.70016 This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. © 2025 The Author(s).

Therefore, the maintenance of heterogeneous small- holder agriculture and sparing the savannas from agricultural expansion and afforestation should be key conservation priorities.

Agriculture is a major driver of this trend (Green et al., 2005), especially where it expands into natural areas (Foley et al., 2005; Godfray et al., 2010). Additionally, agricultural intensifica- tion drives widespread bird population declines through a range of mechanisms (Rigal et al., 2023). This includes shifts towards more capital- and labor-intensive, but also more profitable forms of agriculture, typically associated with higher use of pesticides and fertilizer (Rosenberg et al., 2019). Agricultural intensification often goes hand in hand with mechanization and scale enlargement of agriculture, leading to landscape homogenization and the loss of remaining small habitat patches and structures, thereby leading to biodiversity loss (Fahrig et al., 2015; Stanton et al., 2018), including in birds. Consequently, global bird populations have declined by as much as 25% since the preagricultural era (Gaston et al., 2003).
