Although, in comparison to the sewage water irrigated crops, the treated water irrigations resulted in about 10 to 20% reduced crop yields yet these yields were observed to be about 6% more than those obtained through ground water irrigations (Table 3). Further, as compared to the sewage water irrigated crops, the treated sewage water irrigated crops were observed to be having 6 to 45% lower food-metal sequestration and 68 to 73% lower pathogen load (Table 4) based consumer health hazards. The treated wastewaters at IARI, New Delhi site (as illustrated in Table 1) were also used for aquaculture, as an alternative business model, in collaboration with the Regional Research Centre, ICAR-CIFA, Kolkata and ICAR-Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture (CIFA), Bhubaneswar. As a part of this intervention, 2315 numbers of (5g) Pangus pungus seedlings were stocked in the treated sewage water pond of 0.3 ha area.
