 The maximum efficiency of 99% was obtained at 40 rpm drum speed, 30° inclination and 360 lpm water flow rate. Turmeric cooking vessel: A vessel of 100 kg capacity suitable for pressure steaming of turmeric was developed. Using the improved cooking vessel 100 kg of turmeric can be boiled in 10 min. compared to 15 min as in conventional cooking vessel. Turmeric dryer: A batch type agricultural waste fired rotary dryer of capacity 500 kg was developed. Rotary drying of turmeric rhizomes reduced drying time and shrinkage, thus improved the colour of dried turmeric. Complete drying of turmeric was achieved in 30 hr with an air temperature of 70°C and air velocity of 3 m/s and 9 rpm drum speed, respectively, wherein conventional drying takes about 2-3 weeks. During drying, 70% polishing of rhizomes can be achieved, which minimizes qualitative and quantitative loss. Turmeric polisher: A batch type polisher with 500 kg capacity was developed. To reduce the dust emission the polisher drum was covered by a flexible hood. The dust produced during polishing of turmeric rhizomes in both conventional and dust proof turmeric polisher was recorded. Inhalable and respirable dust concentration was 9.10 mg/m3 and 4.26 mg/m3 respectively during polishing with conventional turmeric polisher. In dust free turmeric polisher the Tobacco Stalk Biochar POST-PRODUCTION MECHANIZATION Vegetable mixed-wadi making system: The machine is fabricated with an overall dimension 1.40×1.20×1.10 m3 with food grade stainless steel body. The outer width of tray table is 300 mm on which five nozzles are pointed to facilitate five droppings of wadi batter in single stroke. The capacity of machine is 150 kg/hr (with each wadi dropping weighing about 5g). The capacity can be increased, if dropping size increases. Different shapes of wadi can be made by changing the shape of the die. POST-HARVEST MANAGEMENT AND VALUE-ADDITION DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 81 properties. Lees from Cabernet Sauvignon had maximum tannin (11.98 mg/g) and anthocyanin (840 mg/g) contents. Similarly, pomace collected from red grape varieties was rich in functional components like phenolics, tannins and anthocyanins. Pomace obtained from Medika was rich in phenolics (44 mg/g), tannin (39.61 mg/g), and anthocyanin (78.39 mg/kg). Cookies inhalable and respirable dust were 0.007 mg/m3 and 0.011 mg/m3 respectively. Only little air-borne particles floated at the rhizomes-discharge end. Pollution resulted from polishing of turmeric rhizomes could be controlled up to 99.4% with the collapsible dust cover. Value added products Kalpa Krunch is an extruded snack from coconut, prepared by incorporating coconut milk residue along with rice (60%) and corn flour (25%). The flavours have been formulated with different spices and vegetables (coriander, garlic, turmeric, clove, cinnamon, chilli, mint, cardamom, tomato and celery).
