 Large-scale renewable solar power projects face various challenges, including technical obstacles like the need for advanced monitoring, resource variability, location compatibility, and maintenance issues [13]. The energy production of such large systems can be sustained for 20–30 years, making them a viable long-term solution [14]. Solar parks have shown the potential to contribute significantly to fulfilling energy demand in Jordan [15]. Whereas, the rooftop PV systems have shown considerable power potential in Sweden, with more than 10,000 MW h annually [16]. The total electricity generation potential of rooftop PV projects was estimated to meet 76.1 % of the social electricity consumption in Nanning City, indicating that rooftop PV systems have the potential to fulfill a significant portion of the energy demand [17]. While the PV system contributes to renewable transition and reduces dependence on external grids, it cannot fully fulfill the electricity demands in the district due to a gap between production and loads [16]. One major requirement to fulfill this objective of solar projects is the availability of land. A study by NREL, states that the total land use requirement for solar power plant projects is about 8.9 acres/MW [18]. If we have to estimate the total land requirement of 280 GW solar power with this input then, it estimates to more than 1 million ha area. It is approximately double of 10 major cities of India combined in area. Agricultural croplands show great potential for PV power potential, as it provides land convenient for power generation from geolocation point of view [19–23]. India, an agrarian country, has second largest farm output in the world [24] and as of 2018, the agricultural sector employed more than 50 % of the Indian workforce, contributing about 17–18 % of the country’s GDP. India is the world largest producer of pulses and spices, and the second largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, groundnut, vegetables, fruits and cotton [25] and even with such a huge food production, food security is a concern in the country. According to UN India (in.one.un.org), around 195 million people in India are undernourished, making it a quarter of the world’s hunger burden. Rising solar power will bring more burden onto the food production stemming from agricultural land encroachment. The water re­ sources in any region are generally used for agriculture, industrial and domestic purposes. Only 18 % of the rainwater is used effectively while 48 % enters the river and most of which reaches the ocean [26] whereas rest is lost via evaporation, transpiration and runoffs. Water is also used for cleaning solar panels and approximately 2 L of water are used to clean one solar module [27]. The industrial field visit to Bhalda solar farm in 2020 substantiates the point. This water is transported from a long distance in tanker trucks regularly.
