 Alluvial soils (inceptisols) were low in available K and black soils (vertisols) were found relatively high in available K status. Available S status of pulse-growing soils was low. All profiles, excepting Varanasi, were deficient in available Zn. Available Fe was sufficient in all profiles, excepting Delhi, and Cu and Mn were sufficient in all profiles. Distribution of sulphur fractions. S ranged from 240 to 376 mg/kg for total S, from 191 to 362 mg/kg for organic S, from 12.9 to 59.0 mg/ kg for adsorbed S, from 3.47 to 9.22 mg/kg for available S. Larger organic and total sulphur was observed in vertisols, followed by inceptisols and alfisols, and adsorbed S was higher in alfisols. Organic sulphur constituted 81–95% in the total S. Distribution of forms of potassium. Vertisols showed higher water-soluble K and 0.01 M CaCl2 extractable K as compared to inceptisols and alfisols. Among 10 profiles, Sehore and Gulbarga soils showed available K (NH4OAC-K) in higher range; Delhi, Raipur, Hyderabad and Bangalore were medium; and Kanpur, Faizabad, Varanasi and Ranchi were low in available K. In reserve K (HNO3 K), alfisols at Hyderabad, Ranchi and Bangalore profiles showed less than 400 mg/kg and rest of the profiles showed above 600 mg/kg. Pigeonpea intercropped with sorghum and seed treatment with Trichoderma harzianum reduced Fusarium udum as well as parasitic nematodes significantly. Orymyrus and Bracon spp. are found potential larval/pupal parasites of pod-fly. Pigeonpea + sesame reduced plant parasitic nematodes and pigeonpea + urdbean cropping system increased them. Seed treatment with Calotropis latex at 1% proved effective against root-knot nematode. MUNGBEAN AND URDBEAN Crop Improvement OUM 11-5 mungbean has resistance to mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) and tolerance to Cercospora and powdery mildew. It has been identified for Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Orissa and Tamil Nadu (kharif). Another mungbean HUM 12 possesses tolerance to mungbean yellow mosaic virus and has been identified for eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam (summer season). Intercropping of pigeonpea with sorghum reduces wilt incidence and nematode population CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 39 Wide crosses between mungbean and urdbean have resulted in promising lines IPM 99-125 and IPM 02-1, which combine early maturity with determinate growth habit and bold seeds. Some of the promising donors of urdbean for photo-insensitivity are NDU 94- 10, IPU 96-1, PDU 103, UH 82-51, STY 2593, Sel 2, DUS 29, PLU 704, No. 4812 and UH 82-35. Crop Production Nitrogen at 20 kg/ha as basal and 10 kg/ha as foliar spray proved beneficial in late sown (August) mungbean with higher yield at high plant density (4–5 lakh/ha). Mungbean PDM 2000-88, TM 99-37, HUM 15 and PDM 139 are found resistant to MYMV disease. Urdbean DPU 88-31 has been confirmed as having stable resistance to MYMV.
