 These QTLs were consensually mapped in several biparental QTL mapping studies representing many donor parents. Major QTLs with high contributions to resistant phenotype are qSBR9-2, qSBR11âˆ’1, qSB-9TQ and qSB-11LE. Also, genome-wide association studies have been attempted to identify genomic regions harbouring resistance marker-trait associations has been identified. Fig. 4.

Most of the reported QTLs imparting resistance to ShB in rice explains <20% of phenotypic variance and also resistance through QTLs may be diluted with different genomic backgrounds, environments and other factors. Therefore, multiple additive QTLs pyramided will give more stable and durable resistance across the environment and genomic background. Pyramiding efforts dedicated to breeding ShB resistance rice are tabulated in Table 3. Biotechnological approach for tailoring ShB-resistant rice Recent advances in isolation and characterization of Pathogen-related (PR) genes, anti-fungal genes, antimicrobial genes, and master genes for defense responses affecting R. solani growth. Additionally, the unavailability of a stable source of resistance against ShB in rice germplasm makes genetic engineering a potentially viable option for designing ShB tolerance in rice. A schematic representation of potential candidate genes utilized for development of transgenics along with their functions are presented in Fig. 5. Glucanase and Chitinase are most widely utilized genes for engineering ShB tolerance in rice. The choice of promoter indeed remains a critical determinant for the success of any genetic engineering program; Rice actin 1, maize ubiquitin and CaMV35S has been widely used for constitutive expression of transgenes for ShB tolerance. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated host-induced gene silencing/ RNA interference targeting pathogenesis- related Polygalacturonase and MAP kinase gene has also been utilized for tailoring ShB tolerance in rice.
