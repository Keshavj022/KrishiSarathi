All the rice growers in Aralkocha village of Purulia district in West Bengal follow this practice for the last 50 years. Yellow stem-borer of paddy (attacking in all the growth stages, except flowering and onward stages) is the most important and major pest problem in lowland paddy. The larva enters the stem and feeds upon the internal plant material, thereby disrupting the vascular passage to the terminal portion (which may be leaf or panicle). It results into drying of the portion causing the symptoms (dead-heart at the vegetative stage and white earhead in the mature stage). Secretary, Aralkocha Kansabati Club, village Aralkocha, P.O.
