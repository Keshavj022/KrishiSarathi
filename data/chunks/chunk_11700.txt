   The establishment of Community Seed Banks for conservation of local genetic material and interlinking the Banks with seed business (especially in the north east) should be a periodical exercise.   Novel local seed systems and alternative seed delivery models should be strengthened. A system of bringing the popular local / traditional / farmer varieties in the formal seed chain needs to be considered. NSC and other SSCs may be entrusted with the responsibility of seed production, quality assurance and marketing.   In view of the shifts in the weather patterns, old varieties need to be evaluated under different changing weather conditions now, instead of discarding.   Modern methods of seed quality assessment need to be adopted for higher precision and uniformity, using advanced technologies and appropriate instruments.   Reporting of ‘seed vigour’ status should be made compulsory in case of revalidated seed lots for ensuring satisfactory field performance of a seed lot. CS4 i Name of the Applicant The Entomological Society of India, Division of Entomology, IARI, New Delhi ii Title 10th International Conference on Controlled Atmosphere and Fumigation in Stored Products iii Venue and Date(s) 7-11 November, 2016 at Hotel the Ashok, New Delhi CROP SCIENCE Compendium Salient Recommendations 16 iv Amount of grant by ICAR Rs. 10.00 Lakhs v ICAR's Sanction no. F.No.24(6)/2016 Cdn. (Tech.) vi Recommendations:   Need for development of cost effective storage systems for farm level storage (capacity 0.5- 2 tonnes) and for agro-processing industries (capacity 1000- 5000 tonnes) and design and development of modern warehouses for bag storage structures (capacity > 10,000 tonnes).   Training of farmers and grain storage agency workers on Bulk Storage Systems with long life may be more suitable for farm level and for agro­ processing units as these are not required to distribute the grain to distant places.   Improvement in design of godowns, their mechanization for grain handling, environment control and fumigation etc. requires attention.

F.No.23(73)/2016-Cdn. (Tech.) vi Recommendations:   Development of compounds affecting different targets like ryanodine receptor modulators, GABA gated chloride channels, uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation inhibition of ATP syntheses, intervening mitochondrial metabolic modulations etc. offer scope for judicial rotation of chemistries depriving target pest to develop resistance to pesticides.
