 This species is also recommend as for seed and soil application just before sowing. Commercial formulations containing Trichoderma are readily available this purpose. Flavobacterium and Pseudomonas fluorescence have been found effective in the control of bacterial blight. Location specific IPM modules were tested at different centres of AICCIP in all the three zones and indicated the following advantages of IPM Module. • Incidence and damage of pest was less • Activity of Natural enemies was more • Number of sprays were reduced by 50 % • The Net income and cost benefit ratio were higher in the range of 1:2.5 • Foliar application of Imidacloprid 35SC, Clothianidin 50WDG, diafenthiuroin (Polo 50SC) were found effective against Sap Sucking insect pests. Emamectin benzoate, KN 128, Spinosad, RIL 038 and Karate zion 5CS were all found effective in controlling boll worm complex. www.icar.org.in 8 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science All India Coordinated Small Millets Improvement Project 1.

Kodo millet Jawahar kodo 48 (JK 48) & KK 2 4. Barnyard millet VL Madira 181 5. Little millet Tarini (OLM 203), Kolab (OLM 36) & OLM 20 6. Proso millet GPUP 8 & GPUP 21 Crop Production • Double cropping of short duration finger millet in kharif followed by either horsegram/niger is a better option and remunerative for Jharkhand. • Sequence cropping of finger millet and soybean in kharif followed by oats/wheat in rabi are profitable options for Uttaranchal. • Pre emergence application of isoproturon @ 0.5kg a.i./ha for drilled ragi whereas oxyflurofen @ 0.1 kg a.i./ha for transplanted irrigated ragi is a better choice for controlling weeds effectively. • Transplanting finger millet is more suitable and profitable under very delayed sowing conditions. • Application of poultry manure to supply 100 % recommended nitrogen is a remunerative practice at Bangalore whereas pine needle compost (3.75 t/ha) along with rock phosphate and gypsum were a better choice for maximizing productivity. www.icar.org.in 9 2002 ‐ 2007 • Application of 7.5 t FYM/ha and rotating either with ground nut or maize with recommended inorganic fertilizers is remunerative practice for targeting higher production in ragi based cropping system at Bangalore.
