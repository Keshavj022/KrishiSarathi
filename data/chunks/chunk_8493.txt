 Crop Production In soybean-safflower crop sequence at Indore and Parbhani, recommended 100% l Identified number of sunflower entries tolerant to downy mildew. Sunflower hybrids released Hybrid Yield Reaction to pests/ Recommended (tonnes/ha) diseases states KBSH 44 1.90 Resistant to major diseases All India and insect pests of sunflower PSFH 118 1.84 – Punjab HSFH 848 1.80 – Haryana l Developed a non-spiny safflower hybrid NARI-NH 1, tolerant to Alternaria and Cercospora leaf-spot diseases and Fusarium wilt. l At Indore and Parbhani, soybean- safflower crop sequence with 100% N and P to both recorded highest yields. l In rainfed areas at Annigeri, Azotobacter treatment to safflower seeds reduced N-fertilizer needs of the crop to 50%. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 32 N and P to both recorded highest yields. Chickpea - safflower system gave highest yields at Solapur with 100% N + 50% P + phosphorus solubilizing bacteria to chickpea and 100% N and P to safflower. Azotobactor seed treatment at Annigeri effectively substituted 50% of the recommended nitrogen needs of safflower in rainfed areas. CASTOR Crop Improvement RHC 1, a new hybrid, a derivative of VP 1 × TMV 5-1, developed at the Agricultural Research Station, Mandor, has been released for Rajasthan. It is the first hybrid release for arid region, and has been reported to out-yield the other castor genotypes of the arid region. Crop Production At Sardar Krushinagar, application of 20 kg S/ha or 15 kg ZnSO4/ha gave higher seed and oil yield of castor. Irrigating castor at 0.8 IW : CPE ratio resulted in increase in seed yield of primary and secondary order spikes. Crop Protection Castor accession RG 2722 has showed resistance to wilt and root rot. In artificial screening, RG 2661, 297, 941 and 1649 accessions were confirmed to be wilt resistant. The nematophagous Trichoderma viride (B 16) has been found effective for controlling Fusarium wilt alone as well as in the presence of nematodes. The shaker-culture method of mass mutliplication of T. viride (B 16) would enhance the shelf-life of B 16 up to 8 months. Talc is effective carrier of T. viride formulation. At Palem, prophylactic Carbendazim at 1g/litre or removal of affected spikes and application of 20 : 20 kg N : K/ha showed promise in managing Botrytis grey rot. SESAME Crop Improvement Three new varieties have been identified for release in sesame. l Released RHC 1 castor for Rajasthan; the first hybrid release for arid region. l Trichoderma viride strain B 16 proved effective in controlling Fusarium wilt of castor alone as well as in the presence of nematodes. Nirmala sesame. It is a white-seeded mutant of B 67 variety, and is characterized by early maturity, of 86 days, tolerance to phyllody and wilt, and resistance to bacterial leaf spot and powdery mildew AKT 101 sesame is a bold, white- seeded variety for cultivation in rabi/ summer in Maharashtra Nirmala (OS-Sel 164).
