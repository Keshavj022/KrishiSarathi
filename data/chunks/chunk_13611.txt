The dependent variable takes a value of 1 when wheat farmers adopt HD-2967 and 0 otherwise. FLD-D (I  1) takes a value of 1 if the district saw the implementation of FLDs of HD-2967 at least once between 2012 and 2017 and 0 otherwise. FLD-D (I = 4) takes a value of 1 if the district saw the implementation of FLDs of HD-2967 four times between 2012 and 2017 and 0 otherwise. FLD-D (I = 3) takes a value of 1 if the district saw the implementation of FLDs of HD-2967 three times between 2012 and 2017 and 0 otherwise. FLD-D (I = 2) takes a value of 1 if the district saw the implementation of FLDs of HD-2967 two times between 2012 and 2017 and 0 otherwise. FLD-D (I = 1) takes a value of 1 if the district saw the implementation of FLDs of HD-2967 once between 2012 and 2017 and 0 otherwise. Time takes value 1 for 2014–15, 2 for 2015–16, 3 for 2016–17, and 4 for 2017–18. FLDs = Frontline demonstrations to promote the new wheat variety (HD-2967). Standard errors in all models are clustered at the district-time level. *p < 0.1, **p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001. 36 Central individuals are those who are most central in a social network and best- placed to diffuse information.
