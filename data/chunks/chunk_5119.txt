 The healing was visible on the third day of application and was almost complete by 7 days of treatment, although the animal showed slight lameness. The hematological examination of sick animals in Groups I and II revealed presence of infection, though the animals showed clinical recovery. As per economics, the treatment of animal in Group I C with gingelly, pig-fat and banana mixture and Gloriosa superba and neem oil paste was cheaper than that of animals treated with boroglycerin and Lorexone of Group II. CONCLUSION The ITK method of controlling FMD is the cheapest treatment, which is in agreement with that of the discloser. Delayed healing of the foot-and-mouth lesions in animals occured, which were treated with a mixture of gingelly oil, pig-fat and banana for oral lesions and Gloriosa superba and neem oil paste for foot lesions. .
