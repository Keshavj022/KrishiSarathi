 Seed is big, bold and reddish in colour. Production technology Now, drought tolerant mateera varieties are in attraction for loiya, seed-kernels and ripen fruits too. These can be successfully grown by sowing in June-July and February-March. Onset of monsoon rains is the best for sowing rainfed crop in arid area. Selected field should be prepared as per topography of sand-dune landscape at the production site. Deep-furrow, channel and drip technology as standardized at CIAH is simple for mateera cultivation. In thoroughly developed and lay-out plot, 1.5–2.0 m apart and 50 cm wide channels or deep-furrows are prepared, or laterals also laid-down for drip technology, which are 25 m in length on one-side of water delivery-line. Prior to sowing, furrows or channels of Indian Horticulture 8 1 hectare area is manured and fertilized with FYM (50 q), vermin-compost (5 q), DAP (100 kg), SSP (100 kg), urea (50 kg), MOP (50 kg) and 10 kg neem-leaf powder and mixed thoroughly. For drip, furrows / channels are converted into seed-bed and lateral-pipes fixed in centre. About 2 kg seed is enough for sowing 1 hectare area. Prior to sowing, seed should be soaked in water for 5–6 hours and also treated with fungicide. Seed should be sown at 50 cm distance at inner-down slope of the channel, centre- line of furrow or near to drippers of lateral-line. At each sowing point, 3–4 seeds should be sown and 1–2 healthy plants are allowed. Thinning of seedling is done at 18–21 days from sowing or when they attain 2–4 true-leaf stage. The crop should be irrigated at 6-8 days intervals by flood method only in the channels or at 2–3 days for 1.5–2.0 hours with drip (lateral 16 mm and 4 lph in-line emitters) under sandy soil. Manual hoeing and weeding is done at 18-21, 28-30 and 40-45 days from sowing and at this time, urea @ 50 kg/ha is applied in 2-3 split-doses. Spraying of insecticide such as imidachloropid (0.3 ml/l), di-methoate and malathion (1.5 ml/l) to manage aphid, thrips, jassid, white-fly and minor insect-pests is recommended at very early plant-growth, flowering and fruit setting stages. For genetically pure seed production, isolation distance of about 500 m is sufficient between the varieties of mateera, watermelon and tumba. Integration of inter- culture operations, spraying, roughing and monitoring is beneficial. Protection measure from birds and wild animals is also required.
