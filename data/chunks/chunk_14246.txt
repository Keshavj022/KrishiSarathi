These metrics were also defined based on stakeholder consultation, and which has the capacity to quantify the relationship between external climate drivers and the performance objectives. Threshold values for each of the metrics were selected as those breaking points, which when surpassed system failure will occur. These are attainable targets of performance objec­ tives, as perceived by the stakeholders. After defining the performance metrics, the external climate drivers or stressors were identified. Since the agricultural production depends on the seasonal climate parameters in addition to the mean climate, the climate stressors chosen were those considering both climate change as well as variability. 3.2. Projecting future climate Ten RCMs within the South Asia domain of CORDEX, as listed in Table 2, were used for projecting the future climate. These ten models were selected after checking how well the RCMs represent the following characteristics of current/baseline climate (i) probability distribution functions (PDFs) (ii) long-term trends (iii) extremes and (iv) annual Fig. 4.

Bias correction was done to correct systematic errors in RCMs in simulating the present climate, introduced due to the difference in spatial scale of RCMs and the ob­ servations. For precipitation, quantile mapping method of bias correc­ tion was employed. In this method, bias correction is done by equating the cumulative distribution functions of the RCM simulated values with those of the observed variables (Cannon et al., 2015). The corrected precipitation is given as (Luo et al., 2018): pcor hst,m,d = ecdf −1 obs,m ( ecdf hst,m ( Phst,m,d ) ) where ecdf-1 is the inverse ecdf pcor hst,m,d is the corrected precipitation on the d-th day of the m-th month. Phst,m,d is the precipitation from original RCM outputs during the historical period. The simulated temperature by RCMs were bias corrected by employing the Linear scaling method.
