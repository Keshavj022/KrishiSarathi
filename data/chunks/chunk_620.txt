 The studies conducted at organic farm, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Bundelkhand University, Jhansi involving three sowing methods revealed that line sowing was improves than cross sowing and broadcast sowing under organic management using variety Giriraj (Table 4).

But, these are most important, as these practices ensure optimum plant population. After germination, re- sowing should be done at places where germination fails to occur to fill the gap and when plant attains a height of 15 cm removing extra plants to maintain crop geometry needs to be ensured. Timely weeding: Mustard fields in Bundelkhand are most commonly infested with annual weeds like Chenopodium album (bathua), Chenopodium murale (khartua), Phlaris minor (Gehun ka mama), and perennials like Cyperus rotundus (purple nutsedge), Cyanodon dactylon (Bermuda) etc. Mustard plant once attain a certain height can suppress the growth of weed. Timely weeding reduces yield loss as weeds compete with crops for water, space and sunlight, thus weeding should be done at the right time to conserve moisture. One hand weeding at 40– 45 DAS is necessary to avoid initial completion between weeds and crops, followed by manual weeding when field gets infested during crop period. Field should be deep ploughed to uproot weed debris at the time of land preparation. Stale seedbed techniques are considered better wherein, field is irrigated prior to sowing and weed seeds are allowed to germinate. The weed seedlings are turned into soil by ploughing before sowing. Irrigation at optimum time: In Bundelkhand most commonly, crops are cultivated under rainfed conditions on the conserved soil moisture from monsoon rains. In absence of rains, one pre- sowing irrigation (to ensure good germination) and two irrigations first at rosette stage (30 DAS) and second at siliqua formation (55- 60 DAS) respectively, should be provided to get higher yield. If only, one irrigation is available, it should be scheduled at 0.6 IW/CPE ratio at 50% flowering or early pod formation stage to get maximum yield.
