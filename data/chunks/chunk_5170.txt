 For one application per animal of group I, 20 g powder was usded. Just before application the powder was mixed with sufficient quantity of liquid paraffin to form a paste. Application technique The paste thus prepared was applied on the fractured limb after the application of few layers of cotton bandages in the animals of group I. The fractured limbs were then stabilized suitably by means of bivalved plaster cast or padded bamboo splints applied on the cranial and caudal aspects of fractured limb, and secured with adhesive tape and bandages. The manu paste was reapplied every fifth day till 15th post- operative day. No medication was used or applied on the fractured limb of animals of group II.

Evaluation of fracture healing Clinical Observations: All the animals were clinically examined regularly for the development and progress of inflammation and oedema at the fracture site. The extent of lameness, weight- bearing capability and extent of pain were also recorded. Besides,the routine clinical parameters such as rectal temperature, respiration rate and heart rate were also recorded at 0, 3, 7, 15, 30, 45 and 60 days after operation. The extent of lameness was evaluated during standing and Table 1. Effect of fracture healing using paste of manu plant roots on rectal temperature in dogs Group no.

Haematological studies From cephalic vein of all the dogs, 5 m blood was collected in heparinized syringes on days 0, 3, 7, 15, 30, 45 and 60 days after operation. A part of it was used to estimate the levels of haemoglobin ( Sahli’s method ) , P C V (microhaematocrit method),TEC, TLC (Neubaur chamber) and DLC using Wright’s staining technique. Biochemical studies The plasma was separated from the remaining blood samples, and the concentration of alkaline phosphates calcium and phosphorus were estimated using Semi - automatic Chemistry analyser (RA-50, Bayer India Ltd). Radiological examination Plain mediolateral radiographs of the fractured limb were taken at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 days after operation in all the animals, using standard radiographic exposure factors (Fig. 2 a-f). These radiographs were studied for assessment of fracture-healing process.
