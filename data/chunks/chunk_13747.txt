 Gallen, Switzerland; daniel.onwude@empa.ch * Correspondence: rosnahs@upm.edu.my Abstract: Parboiled rice is recognized for its greater milling yield and reduced rice breakage compared to raw rice during processing. Additionally, parboiled rice has better glycemic control and numerous health beneﬁts. However, the production of parboiled rice requires energy-intensive processing as well as wastewater production. This study reviews parboiled rice, including its processing condition, nutritional properties, potential use, emerging green technologies, and health beneﬁts. It also discussed the outlook and challenges regarding parboiled rice. In addition, a novel overview of emerging green solutions applied to the process to minimize wastewater creation during parboiling and reduce excessive energy usage is provided. The limitation of parboiled rice for a new market preference is the color. An intense process would cause an unwanted physical appearance. A thorough study should balance the multiple advantages of parboiled rice with the reasonable intensity of the process. Due to its multiple advantages, parboiled rice is demonstrated to be a possible breakthrough in the agriculture and food industries. This review aims to provide a thorough understanding that can be used for academic and industrial purposes. Keywords: parboiled rice; processing; properties; beneﬁts; emerging technology 1. Introduction Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food for approximately half of the world’s popula- tion. In 2021/22, the world’s rice production was 509.87 million metric tonnes [1]. Asia contributes to more than 90% of global production and 88% of consumption [2]. Rice is consumed as a whole grain (brown, milled, or parboiled) as well as in ﬂour and fermented forms. Around 60% of India’s marketed paddy rice grains are parboiled [3]. Before milling, parboiled rice is made by soaking, steaming, and drying the rice. As a result of its low glycemic index, parboiled rice is being increasingly consumed worldwide [4–7]. Asia and several African nations are the most signiﬁcant industrial producers and consumers of parboiled rice [3]. It is preferred over milled white rice due to regional culinary preferences and the improved sensory quality that emphasizes a softer texture and milder ﬂavor [8]. In addition, it has higher calcium, selenium, and vitamin B6 contents, as well as lower phytic acid concentration [9]. Agronomic conditions during harvest also Agriculture 2023, 13, 1390. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13071390 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture Agriculture 2023, 13, 1390 2 of 24 contribute to the necessity of parboiling rice, since nearly all rice grown during the rainy season and rice that has been ﬂooded during harvest are prone to excessive breakage during milling [10]. Parboiling the rice increases its economic value by increasing the head rice yield (HRY) [11].
