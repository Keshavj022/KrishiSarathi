3‰ and of those of the charred samples ranged from −25.5 to −26.0‰. The δ15N values of the uncharred samples varied from 3.8 to 4.7‰, and those of the charred samples from 3.8 to 4.7‰ (See Table 1 for full details). The offset caused by charring was calcu­ lated to be +0.58‰ for δ15N and +0.62‰ for δ13C for the East Indian rice. In the case of the South Deccan rice, the δ13C charring offset was calculated to be +0.44‰ and that for δ15N was −0.02‰. We applied the average offset of 0.28‰ for δ15N and 0.53‰ for δ13C to our archae­ obotanical rice remains to account for the effects of charring. All δ13C values were converted to Δ13C (using the method put forward by Far­ quhar et al. (1989)) to enable comparison with the archaeobotanical data presented below. 5.2. Golbai Sasan The δ13C values of the rice from this site ranged from −24.8 to −25.9‰. The δ13C values were converted to Δ13C (Farquhar et al., 1989) and these values varied between 18.8 and 20.0‰. The δ15N values ranged from 5.4 to 6.5‰. The average Δ13C value was 19.5‰ (standard deviation = 0.5‰), and the average δ15N value 6.1‰ (standard devia­ tion = 0.4‰). Additionally, while it was not possible to formulate a water status framework for rice, the high Δ13C values are consistent with the ‘well-watered’ modern rice samples. Coupled with this, the high δ15N values are consistent with cultivation in rainfed fields of coastal Odisha, with the possible input of manure. 5.3. Gopalpur The δ13C values of the rice from this site ranged from −25.7 to −24.1‰. The δ13C values were converted to Δ13C (Farquhar et al., 1989) and these values varied between 18.1 and 19.7‰. The δ15N values ranged from 5.3 to 9.8‰. The average Δ13C value was 18.8‰ (standard deviation = 0.7‰), and the average δ15N value 8.5‰ (standard devia­ tion = 1.8‰). One sample from Gopalpur, GPR05, was a clear outlier, with a much lower δ15N value of 5.3‰. The Δ13C values demonstrate similarly high values to those observed in Golbai-Sasan and are consistent with a ‘well-watered’ management. The δ15N values are again high, but they are (excluding the outlier) c. 3‰ higher than those observed in Golbai Sasan and c. 2‰ higher than those in Harirajpur-Bang. 5.4. Harirajpur-Bang The δ13C values of the rice from this site ranged from −26.0 to −24.1‰. The δ13C values were converted to Δ13C (Farquhar et al., 1989) and these values varied between 18.0 and 20.1‰. The δ15N values ranged from 6.0 to 9.1‰. The average Δ13C value was 18.8‰ (standard deviation = 0.7‰), and the average δ15N value was 7.3‰ (standard deviation = 1.1‰). The high Δ13C values of the rice grains are consistent with the ‘well-watered’ management strategy. The δ13C values of the horse gram from this site ranged from −26.2 to −24.9‰. The Δ13C values varied between 18.9 and 20.3‰. The δ15N values ranged from 0.9 to 2.0‰. The average Δ13C value was 19.5‰ (standard deviation = 0.7‰), and the average δ15N value was 1.6‰ (standard deviation = 0.6‰).
