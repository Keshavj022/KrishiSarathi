Results and discussion Results obtained from the experiment conducted on 15 farmers’ fields during 2003-04 and 2004- 05 cropping seasons. At 30 DAT minimum mean caseworm infestation (30.9%) was recorded in application of chlorpyriphos @ 1.0 litre/ha compared with 81.3% in control during two cropping seasons (2003-04 and 2004-05), followed by application of parasi leaves @ 100 kg/ha, which recorded 58.1% caseworm infestation. At 60 DAT recorded minimum mean caseworm infestation (9.4%). All the treatments were significantly superior to control. Use of parasi leaves was effective in reducing caseworm population. Conclusion The study revealed that spreading of parasi leaves once 5-10 days after transplanting @ 100 kg/ha helped in reducing both the rice caseworm infestation and larvae population. Application of parasi leaves showed significantly lower infestation of caseworm than control. 4.5 Control of gall fly (Pachydiplosis oryzae) in rice Description of the ITK Gall fly (Pachydiplosis oryzae) is very harmful to rice crop. It damages whole crop of rice. Farmers of Tamar block of Ranchi district in Jharkhand use parso or persu (Cleistanthus collinus) leaves for controlling gallfly. In this practice, fresh leaves of parso or persu are collected and spread in the infested field without processing. About 10 kg leaves are required for 100 m2 area. These leaves are spread at the initial stage of infestation. This practice controls 70-80% insects. All farmers of the village use this age-old practice. Name and address of the discloser Shri R.S.
