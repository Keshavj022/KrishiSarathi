 The size-wise distribution of operational holdings and area operated (Table 2) shows that in the year 2011-12, a majority of farm operators belonged to marginal and small farmer categories cultivating less than 2 hectares of land. Though they constituted about 62.9 per cent of total number of operational holdings, they operated only 26.8 per cent of total operational area. On the other hand, the large farmers (operating land area more than 10 hectares) and medium farmers (with operating land area of 4 - 10 ha) constituting only 24 per cent of total holdings occupied a substantial proportion (i.e., 43.9%) of total operational area. Gujarat is divided into seven agro-climatic regions: i. Southern Hills (Dangs and Valsad districts), having humid climate and 1793 mm average rainfall; ii. Southern Gujarat (Surat and Bharuch districts) with semi-arid climate, with 974 mm rainfall; State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 152 iii. Middle Gujarat (Vadodara, Kheda and Panchmahal districts) having semi-arid climate, with 904 mm rainfall; iv. Northern Gujarat (Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Gandhinagar, Sabarkantha and Banaskantha districts) semiarid climate and average rainfall of 735mm; v. North-west Arid (Kutch district) having extremely arid climate and 340 mm rainfall; vi. North Saurashtra (Amreli, Bhavnagar, Surendranagar, Jamnagar and Rajkot districts) having semiarid climate with 537 mm of average rainfall, and vii. South Saurashtra (Junagadh district); climate here is dry sub-humid with 844 mm average rainfall. 8.1 Productivity Gaps and Major Constraints:   Fragmentation of land holdings   Water and labour crisis   Increasing cost of production   Pest and Disease incidences   Wild animal menace.   Lack of mechanization and small tools and machinery   Climate change effect – biotic and Abiotic pressure   Lack of quality planting materials.   Inadequate farmer field schools and FPOs.   Non-availability of credit and inadequate crop insurance coverage.   Lack of policy and credit orientation for developing rural non-farm employment.

Low Seed Replacement Ratio (SRR) Low rate of replacement of varieties & cultivation of unsuitable crops and varieties. L o w awareness on scientific Seed t r e a t m e n t techniques The SRR in Wheat, Desi Cotton, Pulses, Groundnut and Soybean are less than 50 % in Gujarat. Currently, the change in cropping pattern and sequences are not adequately coping with the ongoing implications of climate variability. Varieties which are more than 20 years old are still in cultivation. Changes have to be brought in wheat, tobacco, maize, pearl millet and groundnut cultivation. Most of the farmers do not follow scientific seed treatment practices. a.
