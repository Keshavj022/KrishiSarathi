Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years): Climatic Characterization • Large database on weather parameters collected by various Research Centres of the Project was analyzed to work out the climatic resources of the region for better agricultural planning. • Climatic variability and the trends of different weather parameters were studied by almost all the centres. The rainfall trend analysis of the stations of rainfed districts indicated that 73 percent of stations shows about short‐term fluctuations in rainfall. • Based on the crop statistics and related weather parameters, crop‐growing environments for mustard, pearlmillet, chickpea, cashew, cardamom and groundnut has been delineated.
