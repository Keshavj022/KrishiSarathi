 These technologies facilitate the rapid, accurate, and comprehensive assessment of plant traits, thereby accelerating the development of stress- resilient fruit varieties and promoting sustainable fruit crop production in the context of climate change. Adopting this multidimensional approach is essential for ensuring food security and long-term success of the fruit crop industry. For further interaction, please write to: Dr Amrut S.

Thermal cameras can identify hot spots in the field, allowing for targeted cooling interventions, such as misting to mitigate heat stress. Multispectral imaging can reveal nutrient deficiencies or pest infestations, prompting precise foliar application that reduces chemical use and enhances crop resilience. For instance, imaging techniques such as thermal cameras and chlorophyll fluorescence have been used to monitor mango trees for desiccation tolerance. In Okra, studies combining thermal and RGB imaging achieved high accuracy in detecting water stress, demonstrating the effectiveness of these technologies in real-time irrigation management. These image-based approaches support improved water management and stress alleviation strategies for various crops. Automated weather stations and forecasting tools provide critical alerts regarding imminent stress conditions, enabling farmers to take preventive actions. For instance, grape growers can adjust irrigation schedules or apply protective treatments in anticipation of sudden rainfall during the sensitive growth stages. Monitoring microclimatic parameters allows for a better understanding of the factors leading to issues such as berry cracking in grapes, enabling adaptive management strategies to minimize potential losses. Drones play a multifaceted role in the monitoring and management of abiotic stress. They provide real-time aerial views of crop conditions, facilitating immediate mitigation when stress indicators are detected. Equipped with multispectral or hyperspectral sensors, drones can assess soil moisture and plant health, and guide interventions, such as moisture retention practices. In greenhouse environments, drones assist in scouting plants for symptoms of deficiency, fruit growth, and Shri M.
