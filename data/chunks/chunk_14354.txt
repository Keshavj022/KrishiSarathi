 Material and methods Carbon dioxide data The CO2 data from GOSAT is used, which is a sun-synchronous polar orbit satellite placed at an altitude of about 666 km in January 2009. It is dedicated to measure atmospheric CO2 and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere of Earth using TANSO-FTS (Thermal and Near Infrared Sensor for Carbon Observation-Fourier Transform Spectrometer) (Kuze et al., 2009). It was developed under joint collaboration of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Ministry of Environment (MOE) and National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) of Japan. The overpass time of GOSAT is 13:00 (local time) every three days, and the diameter of the footprint in nadir is approximately 10 km. The TANSO-FTS detects reflected sunlight in CO2 and CH4 absorption bands in shortwave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths between 0.758 and 2.08 µm. It has a spectral resolution of 0.2 cm−1 and can retrieve ozone, water vapour and mid-tropospheric CO2 by measuring thermal emission between 5.56 and 14.3 µm. Another sensor in GOSAT is TANSO-CAI (Cloud and Aerosol Imager), which is used to screen cloudy pixels during the retrieval process (Morino et al., 2011). In general, the measurement of CO2 by GOSAT is in accordance with other approaches of GHG monitoring that include ground-based, balloons, ships, tall towers and balloon measurements (Inoue et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014). Here, we have used NIES full physics SWIR L3 (Level 3) version 02.81 dataset of GOSAT CO2 over India from 2009 to 2020. The SWIR L3 products are the estimated results of column-averaged concentrations for one month on a global 2.5◦by 2.5◦grid, based on the column abundances of carbon dioxide (XCO2) of the SWIR L2 products by the spatial statistical method, i.e., Kriging (Watanabe et al., 2015). The retrieved CO2 data have been validated using CO2 observation at selected TCCON (Total Column Carbon Observation Network) measurements and showed a bias and standard deviation of about −0.33 ppm and 2.17 ppm, respectively, for XCO2 (Morino et al., 2019). Ancillary data Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Net primary productivity (NPP) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most widely used vegetation index and broadly indicates plant photosynthetic activity and aboveground primary production (Chhabra and Gohel, 2019). It quantifies vegetation by measuring the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs). Its value varies from 0 (minimum) to 1 (maximum). Vigorous vegetation growth is denoted by the maximum value of NDVI (Chhabra and Gohel, 2019). Changes in the vegetation activity are driven by multiple natural and anthropogenic factors that can be reflected in satellite derived NDVI products. NPP is the net carbon gain by plants, which is the balance between carbon gained by gross primary production (GPP – i.e.
