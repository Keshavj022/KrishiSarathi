 3 plots the predicted probability of selection of KVK villages,15 suggesting that villages with higher average land size have a lower likelihood of being a KVK village. To select farmers for frontline demonstrations, KVKs look for easily approachable plots for the demonstration trials (such as farms near roads or in a prime location where farmers have high mobility) and for farmers who are receptive, willing, cooperative, and eager to attend pre-demonstration training at the site.

Our empirical strategy exploits two crucial aspects of KVK inter- ventions. The ﬁrst is its phased-out strategy for interventions, enabling us to identify the control group. The second is the avail- ability of recall-based panel data from 2014–15 to 2017–18 on adopting improved wheat varieties. 2014–15 and 2015–16 serve as pre-intervention years, 2016–17 is the intervention year, and 2017–18 is the post-intervention year. We compare changes in outcomes between the treatment group (KVK beneﬁciary) and the control group (non-KVK beneﬁciary) over the period 2015–16 and 2017–18 in a difference-in-differences framework. In this case, the impact estimate can be interpreted as the causal impact of KVKs under the identiﬁcation assumption that in their absence, changes in outcomes would not be systematically different across treatment and control groups.
