 The solvent system of methanol- water, 25:75 extracted highest amount of withanolides from both above ground part (in terms of WA) as well as root (in terms of WLA) followed by methanol-water, 50:50 and methanol-water, 75:25 i.e., 0.065, 0.052 and 0.028% respectively for above aground part and 0.079, 0.064 and 0.038% respectively for root. Among the individual components, WA content was higher in above ground part compared to root, whereas, WLA content was higher in root than the other plant parts across different solvents tested. In the above ground part, the WA content was significantly higher (up to 14.5 times) than compared to root. Further, when the WA content was estimated in each of the component of the above ground part (Fig. 2), maximum contribution was from leaf followed by stem i.e., 51.76 and 40.26%, in total 92% approximately. Thus, it implies that the residual biomass of W. somnifera particularly the leaf and stem portion can be utilized as a good source for WA. At a very meagre dose, WA provides neuropharmacological properties promoting outgrowth and synaptic reconstruction that is of academic and research interest. The in-silico studies demonstrate Septemberâ€“October 2023 51 Table 1. Total withanolide content in terms of withaferin A (WA), 12-deoxywithastromonolide (WD) and withanolide A (WLA) in different solvent extracts (n=3) of above ground part and root of W. somnifera Solvent system Above ground part Root WA (%) WD (%) WLA (%) Total (%) WA (%) WD (%) WLA (%) Total (%) Methanol 0.013 0.003 0.007 0.023 N.Q. 0.002 0.031 0.033 Methanol-Water (75:25) 0.028 0.000 0.000 0.028 0.009 0.002 0.027 0.038 Methanol-Water (50:50) 0.046 0.006 0.000 0.052 0.017 0.008 0.039 0.064 Methanol-Water (25:75) 0.062 0.003 0.000 0.065 0.004 0.006 0.069 0.079 Water 0.018 0.000 0.000 0.018 0.001 0.006 0.016 0.023 the modulatory effect of WA over multiple targets such as, inflammatory cytokines, transcriptional factor, enzymes, suggesting a potential candidate for treatment of neurological disorder and cancer. Different other bioactivities like antifibrotic, antiherpetic, profibrinolytic, antileishmanial and wound healing effects are associated with this compound. Therefore, WA has profound applications in pharmaceutical as well as nutraceutical industry that can be made available through residual biomass of W. somnifera. As the root portion is used profusely in various ayurvedic preparations for presence of WLA primarily, the above ground part or residual biomass can be used as a potential source for WA. Appropriate solvent extracts may be prepared optimizing extraction parameters that would be rich in WA, will be useful for preparation of ayurvedic formulations, development of potential bioactive drugs, functional foods and others that can accomplish the waste to wealth approach. by using appropriate solvent extracts.
