 Curing of sucker by keeping suckers under shade for 7 days after spraying of insecticides and fungicides is beneficial. About 300-400 gm organic manure, 18 gm urea, 25 gm SSP and 15 gm MOP per plant/sucker is optimum fertilizer dose for pineapple cultivation. “Weed mat” is a mulching technology is very much effective to management of weed growth and nutrient loss. An amount of Rs. 10,400/- per kani is required as additional cost to adopt the mulching technology. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 305 Zone-vIII mAHARAsHTRA Advisories Related to Major Rabi Crops Chickpea: Rainfed chickpea should be sown in first fortnight of October while irrigated chickpea should be sown from last week of October to first week of November. Latest improved desi varieties like Akash, Phule Vikram, Phule Vikrant, JAKI-9218, etc. should be used for high yield. Kabuli varieties like PKV Kabuli-2, Virat, BDNGK-798, etc should be used. Sowing on BBF will be beneficial. For desi varieties, 50-75 kg / ha seed rate should be used based on seed size. In case of Kabuli and bold varieties, a seed rate of 100 kg/ ha should be used. The seed should be treated with 4 g Trichoderma or 3 g Carbendazim per kg of seed followed by Rhizobium and PSB biofertilizer inoculation @ 250 g / 10 kg of seed. A recommended fertilizer dose of 25 kg N, 50 kg P and 25 kg K should be applied as a basal dose at the time of sowing. Applying fertilizers based on soil testing is advisable to identify and fulfil the need of secondary and micronutrients. IPM practices should be followed for the control of Helicoverpa by using 5 Pheromone traps per hectare, one spray of 5 % NSKE at flowering stage and ETL based spray of Quinalphos 25 EC 20 ml or Emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 4 g or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC @ 3 ml per 10 lit of water. Two protective irrigations at flowering and pod filling stage should be given wherever available. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 306 Wheat: The timely sown irrigated wheat should be sown in the first fortnight of November. The late sown wheat may be sown upto15th December if water is available. The rainfed wheat should be sown during first fortnight of October using residual moisture available in the soil. The improved varieties like Tryambak, Godawari, Tapowan, Parbhani-51, PDKV Washim, PDKV Sardar, AKAW-4647, AKAW- 1071 should be used for sowing. Rust tolerant varieties should be preferred. Wheat crop should be irrigated in the critical stages of irrigation i.e., CRI stage (18-20 days), tillering stage (30-35 days), flowering (65-70 days), grain filling stage (80-85 days) and grain maturity stage (95-100 days). If only one irrigation is available, it should be applied at 40-42 DAS, if two irrigations are available, it should be applied at 18-20 and 60-65 DAS and if three irrigations ae available, it should be applied at 18-20, 40-42 and 60-65 DAS for better yield.
