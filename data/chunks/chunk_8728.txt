 The other candidates made significant contributions in breeding bananas for resistance to nematodes and Sigatoka leaf sport in vitro screening of genotypes against Fusarium yellow disease resulting in insensitive clones to the disease; research on modeling of salinization and nitrogen losses under sub-surface drainage system; development of process for long-life and instant mix of the milk product kheer; diagnosis and management of selenium toxicity in animals; various aspects of the IBD disease; development of thermal processing for buffalo meat products to be preserved in retort pouches; pathology of aflatoxin toxicity in Indian major carp; impact of tannery effluent pollution on agriculture and socio- economic conditions of the farming community, and study of iron deficiency in children and its management through nutrition education in Sirsi Taluk of Karnataka. ‘Punjabrao Deshmukh Women Agricultural Scientist Awards’ were given for the development and patenting of a novel, superfast and powerful hyper-spectral data analyzing method and a software for natural resource monitoring from satellite or aircraft platform. Another candidate made improvement of the nutritive value of poor quality roughages evolving suitable treatment with alkali, ammonia and impregnation with urea. ‘The Vasantrao Naik Award for Research Applications in Agriculture for 2001’ was given away for the development of a comprehensive technology for water harvesting and rainwater management for providing full irrigation to transplanted rice-based two crop rotation system. Adoption of technology offers potential to transform the agriculture from subsistence to occupational level in the drought prone areas of Orissa. ‘Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed Award’ was given away for the efforts made on standardization, patent and subsequent transfer of technology for commercial production of herbal beverage from fruits of seabuckthron wildly grown in Leh, Ladakh, and mud carb culture in brackishwater of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. ‘The ICAR Team Awards’ were given away for wheat improvement, pearl millet improvement and production technology; silvipastrol system; developing techniques for value addition and environment safety in rice milling industries; conservation and characterization of coconut germplasm; fish products technology; livestock feed management; and determination of technical needs of the farmers in wet- temperate high hills and sub-temperate sub-humid mid-hills of the Himachal Pradesh based on farming system approach. Eight teachers were honoured for their significant teaching contribution in Plant Breeding and Genetics, Crop Physiology, Horticulture, Natural Resource Management, Fisheries, Avian Diseases and Home Science.
