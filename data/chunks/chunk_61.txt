A much wider intra-variety variation of 12 to 75% in productivity was recorded under farmer practice against the narrow variation of 20 to 32% under CFLDs. The intra-district and intra- variety variations in Barmer, Bikaner and Churu were 20%, 30% and 32% for mothbean variety RMO-2251, respectively. Interestingly, the inter-variety and intra- district variations were also in the same range at 32% for Nagaur, 34% for Jodhpur and 36% for Jaisalmer. This indicated that introduction of HYVs alone cannot help in managing in realizing the potential yields of mothbean in Rajasthan. The management of natural resources and other yield maximizing options shall have to be put in place in the production cycle for realizing the potential harvests from the HYVs. Mothbean variety RMO 2251 proved the best performing which should be promoted by the state department of agriculture. The gap between yields obtained at demonstrations and farmers practices ranged from 16.3 to 64.6%. The narrowest yield gap of 16.
