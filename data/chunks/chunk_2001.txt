 Acquisition of images of paddy crops The dataset is collected from rural areas of interest, which includes total (650 images). Out of the total images collected 95 were normal paddy leaves, 150 with brown spot, 125 with bacterial blight, 110 with sheath rot and 170 with blast disease infected leaves. 70% of the total images were used for training the AI model, 20% for testing and 10% for validation purposes. 2. Pre-processing Includes filtering, color conversion and detail enhancement of image 3. Segmentation The diseased and the non- diseased part of the images are extracted with the help of k-means clustering Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report Table 1 S.No. | Performance Measure | KNN (%) | ANN (%) 1 Accuracy 70 90 2 Recall 65 88 3 Specificity 78 90 4 Precision 72 98 5 NPV 72 99 6 Fl Score 65 97 5. Lessons learned (particular to implementations of use case) Pictures are taken through smart phone and uploaded to cloud server manually, which is a time-consuming process. However, during the implementation phase, drones will be used. 6. Available standards - ICT or Agricultural - Available international standards 7.

Feature Extraction Feature extraction enhances the accuracy of the classification process. Both colour and texture features are extracted in this phase, which, the standard deviation and the mean value are utilized in the colour features. The gray-level co-occurrence matrix parameters such as contrast, energy, correlation and homogeneity are involved in the texture features. 5. Classification of Paddy Leaf Diseases Using Optimized Deep Neural NetworkWith Jaya Algorithm Paddy leaf diseases are recognized and classified with the help of Optimized Deep Neural Network with Jaya Algorithm.
