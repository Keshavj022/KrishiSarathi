in 57 Kuruma Shrimp Penaeus japonicus (Bate, 1888)  The Kuruma shrimp is distributed in the Indo-west Pacific region, from South East Africa to south-east Asia to north Australia.  Broodstocks of an average weight above 40 g for female and above 20 g for males are recruited for the hatchery productions after quarantine screening for all important diseases.  Induced maturation is practiced by unilateral eye-stalk ablation and/or hormonal treatment in hatchery conditions.  Female shrimp reaches final reproductive maturation within 1 to 2 weeks after eye-stalk ablation and lays 80,000 to 3,00,000 eggs depending on size.  Fertilized eggs hatches to nauplii which metamorphosed to six such stages (N 1-N VI) and further to three stages of protozoa followed by three stages of mysis. Larval rearing is completed within 10-11 days and larvae metamorphosed to post-larvae.  A feeding regime starting with microalgae like diatoms maintained at 80,000-1,30,000 cell/ ml is followed during protozoea and mysis stages following which live Artemia nauplius (4-5 nos/PL) and microencapsulated particulate diet is given during Pl1 to PL20 stages.  PL 5 from each larval rearing tanks are transferred to PL nursery tanks where they can grow up to PL 15-20 stages, which become ready for stocking in commercial shrimp ponds.  Routine health check following the level of assessment and complying with HACCP principles and code of conduct of responsible fisheries should be part of good hatchery management.  The seed production technology is yet to be adopted at commercial level.

Grows to 230 mm and 270 mm in TL in case of males and females, respectively.  Gravid females are recorded round the year with two peaks, one during July-September and the other during February-March. Female lays 2-4 lakh eggs.  Seed production can be carried out using wild spawner or hatchery developed broodstock. Gravid females can be identified by observing the gonadal development from the dorsal exoskeleton of the shrimp.  Hatching occurs 12-14 h after spawning.  Larval stages comprise six naupliar stages (NI-VI), three protozoea stages (PZI-III) and three mysis stages (M I-III), and last mysis stage moults to post larval stage (PL-1). It overall takes 9-10 days, to complete the larval stages.  Nauplii larvae are stocked @ 100 nos/litre and feeding starts with first protozoeal stage (PZ-I). Larvae, from PZ-I to M-III stages are fed with Chaetoceros spp by maintaining at 1000 cells/ml in the rearing tanks. PL-1 to PL-20 are fed with microencapsulated diet (@ 2-4 mg/larva/day) and Artemia nauplii (@1-2 no/ml).
