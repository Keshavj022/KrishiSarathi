 In north- eastern plains comprising eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam, where excess moisture/water stagnation often causes mortality of plants during early stage, ridge planting of pigeonpea proved superior to flat-seed beds. This also minimized incidence of Phytophthora stem blight. A positive response was observed in the crop when 15 kg ZnSO4 was applied per hectare across the locations; making it a component of recommended fertilizer schedule in pigeonpea. Seed treatment with sodium molybdate at 4 g/kg seeds was promising in high P soils. FYM at 5 tonnes/ha significantly increased pigeonpea seed yield by 210 kg/ha, besides positive residual effect on the succeeding wheat. At 60 kg P2O5/ha, in pigeonpea + sorghum system on alluvial soils, seed yield of both the crops was highest. Crop Protection BSMR 842 and BSMR 736 have showed resistance to wilt and sterility mosaic across the locations and IPA 38, KPL 43, KPL 44, BSMR 52, BSMR 23, BSMR 889 and BSMR 539 have promised resistance against wilt and sterility mosaic at Kanpur. Pusa 2001-1, H 82-1 and MAL 19 are found tolerant to pod-borer and ICPL 98014 performed better against Maruca vitrata. MAL 13 identified, possesses resistance against Meloidogyne incognita and Heterodera cajani. l Pigeonpea T 21, Bahar and UPAS 120 transformed, carrying various plasmids, having number of gene constructs, including Cry 1Ab. l Pigeonpea GT 288A and 67A confirmed as stable cytoplasmic male sterile lines; identified a few fertility restorers also for GT 288 A. l On alluvial soils, 60 kg P2O5/ha to pigeonpea + sorghum system yielded highest seed yields.

NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY IN PULSE-GROWING SOILS Soil samples representing alfisols (Raipur, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Ranchi), inceptisols (Delhi, Kanpur, Faizabad and Varanasi) and vertisols (Sehore and Gulbarga) were collected and were analysed for various fertility parameters. Distribution and availability of nutrients. All 10 soil profiles were low in organic-carbon content and in available N. Excepting Bangalore, rest of the profiles were medium in available P.
