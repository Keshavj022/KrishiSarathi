 The highest decline in area has been observed in Andhra Pradesh (undivided) followed by Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh including Chhattisgarh and Gujarat. The area is being diverted to more remunerative crops like cotton, maize, soybean and rice. Improving productivity is the key to enhance competitive ability in the marginal agro-ecologies together with enhancing demand, especially among the urban elite for arresting the further decline. Some of the crop improvement and management strategies apart from policy initiatives that require immediate attention for sustaining small millets cultivation are as follows: • Breeding varieties with better tolerance of biotic and abiotic stresses. • Mechanization to reduce cost of cultivation. • Strengthening recombination breeding to create more variability. • Exploitation of the available genetic potential through better crop management. • Quality seed production of improved varieties and promoting varietal spread. • Strengthening of research on grain processing and value addition to improve demand. • Development of health foods, nutraceuticals and their commercialization to promote among the urban elite. • Area expansion to non-traditional regions. • Engaging private sector in millet popularization. • Cooperative, collective and FPO (Farmer Producer Organization) led farming. • Special incentive for low productive areas, organic farming, and MSP (Minimum support price), and assured procurement of produce. • Introduction of millets in PDS (Public Distribution System), mid-day meal and other Public funded programmes. SUMMARY In spite of the nutritional superiority, drought tolerance and adaptability to marginal conditions the area under small millets is constantly declining. Research efforts have resulted in several high yielding varieties and improved production technologies, but the small millets are not able to compete with more remunerative crops. Cultivation of small millets needs urgent interventions by the Government agencies to make it more profitable and attractive. Market development, assured procurement and value-chain development are the key for encouraging the farmers. With the growing demand for food production from limited cultivated area and under changing climatic regimes, small millets can promote farming in a more environmentally sustainable manner ensuring food and nutritional security. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: hari@millets.res.in Table 5.
