 The effect of moisture content on the density and bulk density of paddy and brown rice was contrary to its effect on the density and bulk density of white rice [67–69]. After drying, the moisture percentage of parboiled rice is approximately 10 to 14% [70]. The moisture content is crucial to deﬁne the cooking properties, milling properties, and shelf life of the parboiled rice [26,71]. 5.2. Protein Proteins are large macromolecular structures composed of many long chains of amino acid residues. Especially in comparison to other cereal grains, rice’s protein content of ap- proximately 7% is rather low. Due to the enormous volume of rice produced per year (about 741 million tonnes), a substantial amount of rice protein per human capita consumption is potentially available [72]. Table 3 represents the protein content of some varieties of par- boiled rice and raw rice. The amount of protein content of rice before and after parboiling was relatively stable; parboiled rice protein content was around 8.38% to 11.34%. However, the structural change of the parboiled rice is also linked to the change of the protein during heat–moisture treatment and the drying process. Although the protein bodies in the kernel are ruptured during the steaming process, the total protein and amino acid content of Agriculture 2023, 13, 1390 11 of 24 parboiled rice does not change [32]. However, heat treatment helps hydrolyze the protein, increasing the disulﬁde bond, which elevates the rice’s viscosity and hardness. [26]. The protein in parboiled rice will deﬁne the rice ﬂour’s functionalities and cooking properties. Both protein and lipid content in rice will deﬁne the hydrophobicity of rice [73]. Table 3.

Lipid One of the most sensitive food ingredients is fats (or lipids). Consumers are susceptible to ﬂavor differences, and lipid breakdown is directly linked to food ﬂavor variations. Brown rice contains crude fat (phospholipids, proteolipids, and other lipids)of around 2%. Since crude fat resides predominantly in the germ and aleurone layer, the over-milling of rice may result in a reduction in fat content to 0.1% [72]. Endosperm and other tissues almost entirely lack fat. Rice lipids affect preservation, processing, and preparation. Rice bran, the outermost layer of the rice kernel, contains 15–25% lipids and beneﬁcial compounds [77].
