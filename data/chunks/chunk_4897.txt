 In greenhouse settings, the Mask R-CNN algorithm has been utilized to detect tomatoes in images, successfully identifying objects and their corresponding pixels. This study demonstrated that the performance of the RealSense camera in detecting tomatoes is comparable to laboratory conditions when utilizing higher-resolution images. Onion: A novel image-based field monitoring system has been developed for the automatic detection of onion disease symptoms using deep neural networks. Trained with weakly supervised learning, the system achieved the highest mean Average Precision (mAP) at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold of 0.5, resulting in significant time and cost savings in field crop cultivation. Miscellaneous horticulture crops: For peaches, a deep belief network (DBN) model outperformed the partial least squares discriminant analysis model, achieving the highest accuracy in classifying decayed peaches into three stages: slight, moderate, and severe. In tulips, a Faster R-CNN network was applied to experimental data, yielding results nearly identical to those obtained using previous methods that relied solely on RGB data for the automatic detection of Tulip Breaking Virus. For dates, a novel method utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to distinguish healthy date fruits from defective ones, achieving an overall classification accuracy that surpassed traditional feature engineering methods. In jujubes, a deep learning approach was employed to detect subtle bruises on winter jujubes using pixel-wise spectra extracted from hyperspectral images across two spectral ranges. This innovation could lead to the development of an online system for detecting bruises on winter jujubes in the future. Additionally, pre-trained deep learning models, including AlexNet and VGG16, were utilized to classify five diseases and a healthy plant in eggplants using smartphone images. The modified architecture of VGG16 achieved an average validation accuracy of 96.7%, while the adjusted model recorded an accuracy of 93.33% when tested with field samples. For passion fruit, the feasibility of detecting fruits using depth images was explored, resulting in the development of a Faster R-CNN-based RGB-D detector that identified five growth stages with significant detection rates and classification accuracy. In lettuce, new analytical functions have been developed to map lettuce size distribution across fields, enabling farmers and growers to implement precision agricultural practices based on GPS-tagged harvest regions. SUMMARY AI technology is increasingly gaining attention in horticultural sciences due to the rapid expansion of data availability. It serves as a powerful tool for data assimilation, enabling objective recording of plant growth, accurate assessment of plant status, and swift detection of product quality.
