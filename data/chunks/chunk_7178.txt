 The CIAS scores were below the half mark for more than half of the states. The bottom rank of the state of Rajasthan was followed by states in Indo- Gangetic Plain (IGP) like Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar and Haryana. Besides IGP, rice dominated states of Jharkhand and Assam also performed poor in terms of agricultural sustainability. Much of India’s food grains supply, particularly staple foods like wheat and rice comes from these states and sustainability threats in this region has serious implications on country’s overall sustainability performance. Though the performance was consistently moderate across all the dimensions, water and socio-economic dimensions were the major concerns, in general. Yet the various states have widely varying pattern of agricultural sustainability with unique priorities for improvement. The notable among these are incomplete, deficiency of soil organic carbon and secondary and Average monthly income of agriculture households Income Year Wages Crop Farming Leasing Non-farm Total production of animals out of land business income Nominal income 2002–03 819 969 91 236 2,115 (39) (46) (4) (11) (100) 2012–13 2,071 3,081 763 512 6,426 (32) (48) (12) (8) (100) 2018–19 4,063 3,798 1,582 134 641 10,218 (40) (37) (15) (1) (6) (100) Real income with CPIAL, 2002-03 2,340 2,769 260 674 6,043 2018–19 prices (39) (46) (4) (11) (100) 2012–13 2,749 4,090 1,013 680 8,532 (32) (48) (12) (8) (100) 2018–19 4,063 3,798 1,582 134 641 10,218 (40) (37) (4) (1) (6) (100) Real income with GDP deflator, 2002–03 2,836 3,355 315 817 7,323 2018–19 prices (39) (46) (4) (11) (100) 2012–13 3,011 4,480 1,109 745 9,344 (32) (48) (12) (8) (100) 2018–19 4,063 3,798 1,582 134 641 10,218 (40) (37) (15) (1) (6) (100) Numbers in parentheses indicate the percentage share.

A trade-off between socio-economic and environmental factors was observed. The Eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam and Chhattisgarh were laggard in agricultural sustainability, mainly because of poor economic efficiency. Besides, soil health dimension was equally poor in these states, mainly due to problematic soils (acidic soils). In the eastern and north-eastern region of the country, improving cropping systems by strengthening infrastructure, particularly irrigation potential, improving productivity, small farm mechanization, developing stress tolerant varieties are the top priority identified for sustainable intensification.
