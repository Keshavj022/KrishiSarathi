 The variety M35-1 is a popular landrace grown by farmers in rabi tracts of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana since 1976. Most of the present-day improved varieties are the result of pure-line selection practiced among the local/popular varieties and their crosses. The varieties for specific soil types (shallow, medium and deep) have been released. Moreover, improved cultivation practices including crop management are also available and evaluated under farmer’s fields in sorghum growing regions. The potential varieties have lustrous, bold and globular size grains which are recommended for different states (Table 1). Table 1.

To improve the water retention, compartmental bunds of 10 m × 10 m in the month of August are recommended to conserve the rain water. Method and time of sowing The crop is sown by bullock drawn seed drills with 2 or 3 coulters at 5–7 cm depth in the soil. The seeds are covered by one harrowing after sowing by seed drill. It is also sown by tractor drawn seed drill with 4 coulters with simultaneous covering of seeds by blade attached to the seed drill. Time of sowing The optimum sowing time for rabi sorghum is 2nd fortnight of September to 1st fortnight of October. In double cropping practice, sowing is extended up to 2nd fortnight of October. Seed rate spacing and plant population Seed rate of 8–10 kg/ha or 3 kg/acre is recommended. Spacing between row to row distance of 45 cm and plant to plant of 15 cm is recommended. Plant population in rainfed conditions is 1.35 lakh/ha and in irrigated conditions is 1.50–1.80 lakh/ha. High seed rate @10–12 kg/ha is recommended in case of delayed sowing.
