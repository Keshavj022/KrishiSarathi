 Reliability of machine learning models Each model undergoes preliminary testing to ensure its correct framework before selecting machine learning methodologies. The training and test datasets for this research are separated using a trial- and-error technique focussed on obtaining the lowest possible RMSE error value. This approach is used to divide the data. All models are screened to define their optimal structures and provide the best possible output. Eighty percent of the groundwater samples are part of the training dataset and twenty percent of groundwater samples are part of the validation dataset after partition. Thus, out of 94 groundwater samples, 75 are in the training (calibration) dataset and 19 are in the testing (validation) dataset (Singha et al., 2021). Validation of hyper-parameter optimization is done by using K-fold cross-validation (CV). In works involving water resource modelling, K- fold cross-validation is well-known (Wu and Fan, 2019; Barzegar et al., 2019). In the current study, model simplification error is assessed using a K-fold cross-validation (K) value of 5 (Singha et al., 2021). The next model used to estimate the WQI of the research area is the SVM model. Fig. 8.

Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 229 (2025) 109932 14 The SVM model has undergone model adjustment and optimization, according to section 2.6.1. Compared to RBF and polynomial kernel functions, the linear kernel function of the SVM model provides a better level of dataset accuracy. The model validation based on the ideal preÂ­ dictive SVM model yielded 92 % accuracy with MSE = 0.19, MAE = 0.23, RMSE = 0.4, RSR = 0.039, NSE = 0.92, MAPE = 2.3, and R2 = 0.923 error and precision values in the training set (Fig. 8) and MSE = 0.05, MAE = 0. 05, RMSE = 0.22, RSR = 0.02, NSE = 0.97, MAPE = 1.31, and R2 = 0.97 with 97 % accuracy in the test (Fig. 9). SVM model and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were used to predict the irrigation water quality index in the Nubian sandstone aquifer of the eastern Sahara Desert by Ibrahim et al., 2023. In this study, SVM model performed with better accuracy in the training set (R2 = 0.97) and testing set (R2 = 0.76). In this study SVM model performs with accuracy in the training set (R2 = 0.923) and testing set (R2 = 0.97) signifies SVM shows excellent performance to the dataset used in this study. The KNN model has undergone model adjustment and optimization, according to section 2.6.2. Model validation based on ideal prediction KNN model with error and precision values of MSE = 0.63, MAE = 0.52, RMSE = 0.79, RSR = 0.09, NSE = 0.69, MAPE = 11.62, and R2 = 0.69 yielded 69 % accuracy during training (Fig. 8) and MSE = 0.35, MAE = 0. 28, RMSE = 0.59, RSR = 0.06, NSE = 0.77, MAPE = 9.79, and R2 = 0.77 with 77 % accuracy in the test (Fig. 9).
