 The Indian government spends billions of rupees every year on providing subsidies and soft loans to the farmers, yet these initiatives are not yielding the desired output on the ground. For instance, the amount of loan is spent either on marriage and education of children or on improving the economic status i.e., buying various household appliances and two or three-wheelers. The subsidy provided on seeds, fertilizers, and water leads to overutilization of these resources, which itself is an unsustainable practice. Only incentives and extension services showed a statistically signiﬁcant and positive relationship with the adoption of SAPs. Thereby, attention should be paid to providing technical training and extension services to the farming community for improving their behaviour toward sustainable agriculture practices. iii) Private and public actors need to proactively cooperate and comply with each other for enhancing the uptake of agricultural sustainability prac- tices. iv) Signiﬁcant effort is required in form of policies, schemes and incentives such as increased support price for crops grown via sustainable means, creating awareness, knowledge along with showcasing real-life successful examples of improved crop yield and soil quality after implementing SAPs.
