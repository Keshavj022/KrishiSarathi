 Under this project, eight villages namely Mehal Kalan, Kalala, Chananwal, Moom, Dhaner, Hamidi, Pamal, and Qila Raipur—were adopted in Barnala and Ludhiana Districts, benefiting over 800 farm families since the project’s inception. In these villages, multiple technological interventions were implemented to enhance livestock productivity and consequently, farmers’ income. Based on the baseline survey, the constraints faced by buffalo farmers were identified, and suitable technologies were introduced to address these challenges. Beneficiary During the project, Shri Harmeet Singh from Village Moom in Barnala District was one of the selected beneficiaries under the University’s Farmer FIRST Programme. At 41 years old, with minimal formal education, he envisioned a future in buffalo farming. After inheriting one buffalo and 3 acres of land from his father in 2020, he relied primarily on the buffalo for livelihood. The buffalo’s average milk production was 9 litres/day, from which he sold 8 litres locally in the village, keeping one litre for household use. With the project already launched and Village Moom adopted, extension efforts were underway. Driven by an interest in buffalo farming and a desire to scale up, Shri Harmeet Singh began attending training sessions, field days, and awareness camps organized under the project, maintaining regular communication with University experts. His initial rearing practices revealed minimal awareness and adoption of nutrition- and health-based livestock technologies. This common scenario allowed for a strategic plan to be developed to reorient the micro- farming landscape in the region. Interventions A set of interventions was designed to boost buffalo farming in the region. A 'train and deliver' (T&D) methodology was developed, providing farmers with on-farm training and then immediately delivering the necessary inputs to maximize adoption and results. Based on primary data, the interventions were categorized into primary and secondary, as detailed below. Primary interventions: Primary interventions were those that had a direct, favourable impact on the micro- farming scenario, leading to tangible gains. These interventions brought significant and desirable changes to both the farmer’s capacity and livestock. They included training on various aspects of buffalo farming, followed by delivery of the inputs to beneficiaries. Key livestock nutritional technologies—such as mineral mixtures, bypass fat, urea molasses mineral blocks, silage feeding, and ration balancing services—were provided to farmers. It was also observed that anestrus was a major reproductive disorder in the village, so treatment camps were organized, and farmers were trained on optimizing buffalo fertility, which Shri Harmeet Singh attended. He was also trained to perform timely artificial insemination when animals were in heat. For optimal health management, dewormers were provided, along with vaccination advisories.
