 In the 15–30 cm layer, RW had significantly less macroaggregates than all other land uses. Soils under RW had ~23% and 26% less macroaggre­ gates than RV and MW land uses, respectively. Soils under RW showed highest proportion of microaggregates in the surface layer (Table 4). In that layer, soils under AH and RW system had 31% more microaggregates than RV land use. However, NF and NG didn’t show any significant difference in proportion of microaggregates among them. Again, soils under MW showed 26% more microaggregate proportion than RV in this layer. However in the 15–30 cm layer, soils under RW had highest proportion of microaggregates. Soils under NF, RV and MW had no significant differences in microaggregates.

Soil & Tillage Research 223 (2022) 105443 4 soils under RW had 43%, 28% and 44% more microaggregates than NF, RV and MW land uses, respectively. In surface layer (0–15 cm), the proportion of silt and clay didn’t show any significant difference among the land uses, except NF land use. The soils under NF had the least proportion of silt and clay in surface layer among all land uses (Table 4). But in the lower layer, significant variation was observed. Soils under RW had the highest proportion of silt and clay in the 15–30 cm layer, whereas NG had the least. Soils under RV had 85% more silt and clay proportion than NF. Whereas, soils under NF and NG didn’t show any significant difference in proportion of silt and clay. In the 15–30 cm layer, soils under RW had 262% more silt and clay than MW and 78% more silt and clay than RV land use.
