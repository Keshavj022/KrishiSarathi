 Salient achievements • In 1912 the Institute was established and now the institute is 109 years old • In 1918 the first variety Co 205 was released which made a sugar revolution in India • Since then over 3380 Co varieties were identified, of which 180 have become commercially successful. Major varieties are Co 285, Co 312, Co 419, Co 740, Co 7717, Co 6304, Co 86032, Co 0238, Co 15023 and Co 11015 • The Institute supports National sugarcane improvement by facilitating hybridization for 24 agricultural universities and research stations of India through fluff supply programme since 1972. • Co canes cover over 80% area in the country, and two major varieties Co 86032 and Co 0238 cover over 70 % area and figure in the top 8 sugarcane varieties in the world. • Co 0238 the wonder variety occupied 27.8 lakh hectare in 2021-22, and transformed India to a sugar surplus country, paving way to export of sugar as well as opening up bioethanol production. Presently the country could achieve 10 % blending mainly due to the contribution of Co 0238. Farmers got an additional benefit of Rs. 53,937 / ha and significantly played a major role towards Atmanirbhar Bharat. The cane productivity in India increased from 60.t/ha 214-15 to 81.8 t/ha in 2020-21, and crossed the world average productivity of 77 t/ha. 19 Crop Science 19 • Co 86032 released in 2000 AD has been covering 8.5 lakh ha to 12.5 lakh ha since 2008 and improved productivity in Southern states. It has a demonstrated productivity up to 420 t/ha, a figure not achieved with any other variety so far. • The Institute has made pioneering contributions in management of red rot, smut and other diseases and came out with viable and cost-effective technologies. The recently licensed technologies are given. 4. Knowledge/skill/technologies/products/other services available for different stakeholders Technologies commercialized: i. Soil Moisture Indicator ii.
