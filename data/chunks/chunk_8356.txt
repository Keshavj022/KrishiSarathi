 About 37% overall average yield increase was observed in the demonstration plots over the farmers’ practice. Pulses: Under demonstrations of various pulse crops about 37% overall increase in the yield was observed in 38,445 demonstrations covering 13,944 ha during the reported period. The pigeon pea, black gram, lentil, field pea and green gram were demonstrated. The average yield advantages for above crops were 37, 42, 37, 57 and 32%, respectively. Commercial crops: Under commercial crops, 2,432 demonstrations were conducted in 912 ha. Of these, 1,542 (64%) demonstrations covering an area of 533 ha were covered under cotton crop and rest under sugarcane and potato crops. In cotton crop, 18% increase in yield was observed over the farmers’ practice. The average yield advantages for sugarcane, potato and cotton crops were 35, 43, and 19%, respectively. Fodder crops: FLDs on fodder crops like berseem, sorghum, maize etc. were conducted in 327 ha in 2,207 demonstrations. The average yield advantages for these crops were 22, 41 and 34%, respectively. Horticultural crops: Demonstrations (16,718) organized on horticultural crops were: 13,626 in vegetable crops, 2,408 fruit crops, 495 flower crops, and 189 in plantation crops. The yield advantage was recorded up to 34% in fruit crops. The average yield advantages for above crops were 33, 34, 35 and 49%, respectively. Hybrids: Production potential of hybrids (cereals, commercial crops, fodder, vegetables, millets, oilseeds such as mustard etc.) was exhibited through 3,446 demonstrations on 1,239 ha by 482 KVKs. The average yield increase was 25% in cereal crops, while 19% for cotton. In demonstration of fodder crops, the yield increase was 20.33% in hybrid Napier, while 22% in pearl millet hybrids over existing varieties. In papaya hybrid demonstration, 44% yield gain was recorded in demonstration plots over farmers’ practice. Highest yield advantage of 57% was recorded in beans. Farm mechanization: To showcase the effective and efficient use of improved tools and implements, 2,493 demonstrations were conducted on farm operations like planting/sowing (896), post-harvest operations (344), weeding (420), plant protection (60), harvesting and threshing (294), and land and seed bed preparation (479). Harvesting rainwater for yielding dividends in NEH region Under National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) project, the KVK, Tura assessed the water related problems in West Garo Hills district of Meghalaya, and ventured into popularizing low- cost rainwater harvesting structure (Jalkund) for harvesting of rainwater during the rainy season and its subsequent use during dry periods. In these Jalkunds of size - 5× 4× 1.5 m3, low cost raw material Awareness on Soil Health The KVKs across the country celebrated World Soil Day on 5 December 2015. Soil Health Cards were distributed by 599 KVKs.
