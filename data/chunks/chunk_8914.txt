 The selected line produced 4,048 g of egg mass; 72.04 eggs during its 40th weeks of part record with 56.19 g average egg weight. The pullets of the selected line matured at an age of 158.59 days. Under the programme on ‘Development of gene lines with single genes’, attempts were made to develop the Naked Neck line as a true breeding broiler population. A homozygote dwarf line was also developed keeping in view its potential as a meat type female parent line for tropical broiler production. The average egg number and egg weight in Naked Neck gene line were 49.82 and 60.95 g at 40 weeks of age and corresponding measures in dwarf line were 66.70 and 56.86 g. The feed efficiency line has completed S-3 generation of selection, taking residual feed consumption up to 40 weeks of age as a selection criterion. For S-3 generation, the reproductive performance revealed fertility as 90.04%, and hatchability on fertile eggs transferred basis as 73.78%. Comparative performance of the feed efficiency line along with control population revealed that pullets of selected line matured at 153.78 days of age, and produced 95.94 eggs up to 40 week of age with 50.75 g mean egg weight (40th week). Corresponding observations on above traits in control population were recorded to be 166.47 days, 77.88 eggs and 54.30 g, respectively. Feed consumed/dozen eggs and per kg of egg mass were recorded at two stages, viz. 37-40 weeks and 61-64 weeks. FC/kg of egg mass was quite comparable in the selected line in both the stages being recorded to be 2.947 kg and 2.910 kg of feed/ kg of egg mass, respectively, more feed consumption per dozen of eggs during 61- 64 weeks (2,076.71 g) in comparison to 37-40 weeks (1,787.89g) accounted for better egg size at 2 later stages of egg production (59.56 g > 50.75 g). Participation in random sample policy performance test centers: The commercial BACKYARD/RURAL POULTRY PRODUCTION The programme on ‘Development of Germplasm for Backyard/Free Range Farming for Rural and Tribal Areas’ was on priority for Project Directorate on Poultry. The male and female lines were maintained, selected and evaluated for growth and production at different ages. The regeneration of both the lines was aimed at developing colour germplasm by giving emphasis on high immune competence, long shanks, moderate body weight and high egg production to suit the requirements Free range rearing of local birds of free range rearing under rural/tribal conditions. Two subpopulations carrying genes for high and low antibody titers against sheep RBC were developed and maintained as pedigreed populations in the male line. In addition, a brown egg layer line is being maintained, evaluated and improved for utilizing the same for developing a tinted layer for backyard poultry production in the long run. Transportation of birds using local basket LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 101 layer stocks of CARI participated in the various test centres.
