 Production technology Bitter gourd is a sub- tropical vegetable and requires hot and dry climatic conditions for its successful cultivation. It can be grown on many types of soils but sandy loam and loamy soils are the best for its production. The required seed rate is 6-7 kg/ha. Before sowing, the seeds should be soaked in Captaf @ 2g/L water solution for about 24-30 hours. The channels of 45 cm wide and 30-40 cm deep are made from east to west in the prepared field. Distance between one channel to another channel is kept 2.0 m but it can be reduced to 1.5 for high density planting. The seeds are sown in prepared hills 50 cm apart on the northern slopes of the channels. About 15-20 tonnes FYM, 100 kg calcium ammonium nitrate or 50 kg urea, 200 kg single super phosphate and 75 kg muriate of potash per ha need to be applied at the time of soil preparation. Another dose of 50 kg urea should be top dressed in 2 split doses at the time of vining and initial fruit setting in the crop. Light irrigation is given at 4-6 days interval during summer season and once in a week in kharif season if there is no rain. Two to three weeding should be done when needed to keep down the weeds under complete control till the plants start trailing. Fruits should be harvested when they are still tender and their seeds are immature. Plant protection Fruit fly pheromone traps (10 traps/ha) may be placed along with baits of malathion for control of fruit fly during flowering and fruiting phase. For fruit fly control, add 100 g Jaggery and 10 ml Malathion in 1 L of water and keep in the plot (4-6 places/acre). Foliar application of Imidacloprid (0.03%) after transplanting at 10-15 days interval for 60 days is effective to control major insects in bitter gourd. Spraying of insecticide must not be done at the flowering stage early in the morning hour when honeybees are active in pollination. Powdery mildew symptoms first appear as round white spots on the under surface of the older leaves and later T K Behera*, A D Munshi and S C Rana Pusa Purvi: New variety of small fruited bitter gourd Pusa Purvi has been released and notified by the Central Sub-Committee on Crop Standards, Notification and Release of Varieties for Horticultural Crops for cultivation in National Capital Region of Delhi and its adjoining areas. The growers will be benefitted by this variety because of its prolific bearing, better nutritional quality and organoleptic taste. Research Indian Horticulture 6 Table 1.
