 Chemical fertilizers were introduced in the country in 1940s. Their large-scale use, however, started with the advent of Green Revolution in the 1960s with the introduction of high-yielding Indian Agriculture after Independence 70 dwarf varieties that were resistant to lodging on the application of high doses of fertilizers and development of irrigation facilities. 4.3.3. Soil biology and biochemistry The pioneering work of C.M. Hutchinson laid the foundation of soil microbiology in India bringing out the importance of bacteria in soil fertility. The earliest landmark was C. Barghtheilâ€™s work during 1903 to 1908 on soil inoculation of indigo (Indigofera tinctoria) in North Bihar. Subsequently, soil inoculation was introduced to nodulate Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum). N.V. Joshi was the first to work on nitrogen fixation in groundnut, and nitrification from 1911 to 1919, and then on biological decomposition of organic matter and prevention of nitrogen losses from soil during 1919 to 1921 (Joshi 1932). Nitrogen fixation was also investigated by P.E. Lander in Punjab from 1925 to 1927 and B. Viswanath at Coimbatore during 1925. Studies on actinomycetes were undertaken by R.V. Norris and V. Subramanyan from 1929 to 1930. B.N. Singh developed a methodology for the study of soil protozoa and other soil flagellates (1941, 1946) highlighting their role in biological equilibrium in soil. For the first time in India, systematic research on isolation and identification of Rhizobium from different cultivated legumes started with a study by N.V. Joshi in 1920. Non- symbiotic nitrogen fixation and the mechanism involved were investigated at Bangalore and Coimbatore by T.R. Bhaskaran and V. Subramanyan during 1935-38, and in Punjab by N.V. Joshi, S.V. Desai and M.R. Madhok during 1933 to 1939 (Ghosh 1984). C.N. Acharya in 1940 recognized the importance of organic manures in enriching soil fertility and better utilization of agricultural wastes for production of biogas and compost. P.K. De (1936) reported that the fertility of Indian rice fields is maintained due to the proliferation of Cynobacteria in the soil. Later, R.N. Singh (1942) at Banaras Hindu University established agricultural significance of blue green algae (BGA) in the nitrogen economy of soils growing rice. Establishing the role of biological nitrogen fixation by V. Subramanyan, loss of nitrogen during decomposition by T.R. Bhaskaran and relationship of soil fertility with total microbiological activity by S.V. Desai and W.V.B. Sundara Rao are regarded as other significant developments in the field of soil microbiology during 1936 to 1941 (Ghosh 1984). 5. Conclusion Under the ever-intensifying pressures of population and unscientific development, the natural resources have been shrinking and declining fast, reaching a critical level. Global climate change is adversely affecting crops, soils, water and biodiversity aggravating the deterioration of the resources.
