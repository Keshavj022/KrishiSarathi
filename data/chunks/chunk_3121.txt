 • In direct seeded rice, intercropping of sesbania was effective in lowest weeds at Bangalore, Gwalior, Jorhat, Dapoli, Sriniketan, Palampur. www.icar.org.in 83 2002‐2007 Maize • In maize, intercrops like green gram, soybean, cowpea were found to reduce weeds at Anand, Palampur, Banagalore, Dharwad. Sugarcane • Pre‐emergence application of metribuzin or Ametryn with two hoeings was effective at Pantnagar, Kanpur . Pigeonpea • Pigeonpea + soybean with metolachlor was the most productive system at Gwalior. Potato • Metribuzin 0.5 kg/ha followed by earthing up produced higher tuber yield at Gwalior, Palampur, Pantnagar, Sriniketan. Management of parasitic weeds • In lucerne farmers practice (weeding at 30 DAS and after each cut) and pendimethalin 0.5 kg/ha post‐emergence controlled cuscuta and produced higher fodder yield at Hyderabad. • At Parbhani, in soybean Pursit 150 g/ha controlled cuscuta and higher yields were obtained. • In niger crop at Bhubaneswar, cuscuta was controlled with trifluralin 2.5 kg/ha. • Orobanche weed population markedly declined with application of trifluralin 1.5 kg/ha in mustard at Gwalior.
