 At present, the crop is commercially cultivated in several countries of the world. In India, it is cultivated mainly in North Bihar, West Bengal and some parts of Assam. Bihar is the leading state of makhana producing state contributing 85% of the total India’s production. It is considered as cash crop and is marketed in the form of popped makhana, commonly known as Makhana pop (lawa). In Bihar, its cultivation is concentrated in seemanchal (Koshi) region encompassing 10 districts of Bihar (Table 1). This district has vast area under water stagnation for 6-7 months in a year with varying depth of water table. It is the fifth agricultural produce from Bihar which received the GI tag due to its specific climatic condition. It helps farmers to get the maximum price of their produce. Makhana is an exclusively self-pollinated plant in which fertilization takes place at an early stage of their development. Its flower is epigynous, produces bright purple flowers having more than 40 corolla, ovary (7- 16) chambered with 6 - 8 seeds/locule. It has industrial demands as a source of high-quality starch for textile industries especially for coating Banarasi sarees and Indian Farming 74 (03): 40-43; March 2024 silk cloths which contain quality fabrics and starch has appreciable amount of amino acid. The expanded and popped kernels are used in almost all the Vedic oblation and other religious rituals. Despite the unique properties of makhana, the consumers have lack of information about the product and its various uses. Transportation plays a vital role in the supply chain of makhana, a commercially produced product primarily Table 1.

It has good health benefits, many medicinal values and most common dry fruit which has low or negligible fat content, but rich in protein, carbohydrates and minerals. It is used for milk-based food preparations like kheer, pudding etc. To enhance its economic significance, standard agro-techniques such as improved varieties (viz. Sabour Makhana 1, Swarna Vaidehi), climate and cultivating system, integrated nutrient management (INM), harvesting techniques, and post-harvest packages are necessary to the farmers inorder to realize potential yield and achieve better returns.
