 They are being improved through selection. BHARAT MERINO, a fine wool synthetic, is as good as RAMBOUILLET/MERINO purebred both with regard to reproduction and wool yield, and in being well- adapted to tropical conditions. BHARAT MERINO is being used for improving carpet wool breeds MALPURA and CHOKLA. MUTTON SYNTHETIC, AVIMANNS (DORSET/SUFFOLK x MALPURA/SONAD)I) are fed intensively and weigh more than 30 kg at six months of age. Small ruminant, the rabbit has been bred successfully for meat and wool. Imported strains have been selected for the different ecologies. The broiler rabbit SOVIET CHINCHALLA, WHITE GIANT, GREY GIANT and NEW ZEALAND WHITE attain a body weight of 2 kilos at 12 weeks of age. They are being improved to attain 2.5 kg at 12 weeks. The annual wool yield of the rabbit GERMAN ANGORA is 500-600 g. Rabbit- farming for wool and meat has been accepted by the farmers as a fulltime occupation in several areas of the country especially in the hilly terrain of the Himalayas. Pashmina goats CHEGHU, CHANGATHANGI and their crosses with local goats at 3/4 level produce on an average 125-210 grams of superior quality pashmina BHARAT MERINO, crossbred of CHOKLA and NALI sheep with RAMBOUILLET and SOVIET MERINO and stabilized at 3/4 level through inter se mating and selection, has been evolved at the Central Sheep and Wool Research Institute, Avikanagar. It produces 2.9 kg greasy wool of 19 micron diameter with less than 2% medullation and a staple length of 9.0 cm (right). Natural colours, extracted from the bark of trees, flowers and leaves, used with metallic salts for dyeing the wool neither leach nor affect its tensile strength (above) Astrain of MOHAIR goat has been developed by crossing the exotic ANGORA with the local SANGAMNERI. It is capable of producing 1.5 kg mohair hair at 87.5% exotic inheritance level. New strains of poultry for meat and egg are in commercial production. IBL 80 and IBB 83, the two hybrids of poultry broilers weigh 1,800 g at 8 weeks of age, while layers ILI 80, ILR 90 and ILM 90 produce more than 270 eggs per annum. CONTRIBUTION OF INDIAN LIVESTOCK GERMPLASM RESOURCES TOWARDS DEVELOPMENT OF NEW BREEDS Zebu cattle have relatively lower basal metabolic rate, better capacity for heat dissipation and resistance to diseases, especially the tick-borne diseases than the temperate Taurus cattle. Therefore Zebu cattle ONGOLE, KANKREJ, GIR, THARPARKAR and SAHIWAL have been used in South America and Australia for developing their own new beef-and-dairy breeds. Zebu is also raised as a pure breed in many of these countries. MURRAH a high milk-yielding buffalo, has been invariably used as an improver breed for grading up of the non-descript low-milk-producing buffaloes in Europe, and SWAMP buffaloes in South-East Asia. The progeny raised from MURRAH x SWAMP buffaloes is performing well.
