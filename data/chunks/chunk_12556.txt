 As per potential reported by SAUs nearly 5 times more mango and cashew can be obtained when compared to present average yield. The yield gap for banana is nearly 30 MT /ha. For other fruit crops the productivity gap ranges from 2 to 5 MT/ha. Table: Yield Gap Analysis For Major Fruit Crops (Mt/Ha) S.

The precipitation patterns are changing, perhaps raining at undesirable times, and encouraging excessive vigour during early period after fruit pruning and increase loses due to downy mildew. Warming climates are sure to encourage new pests and diseases, notably insects following their habitat change. They may also affect the natural parasites and predators increasing pest attack 336 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 due to change in the natural ecosystem. There may be changes in pathogen populations and introduction of new pathogens to new areas. Further, seasonal changes in climatic conditions, too, are impacting grape productivity either in terms of reduced fruitfulness due to high temperature, increased disease and pest problems due to unseasonal rainfalls and/or salinity due to reduced rainfall. In fact, the seasonal changes can also influence the formation and ratio (at favorable levels) of sugar and pro-phenols in grapes, thereby affecting the quality of produce. Thompson seedless is main variety under cultivation contributing 80% share in national grape export. But it consumes substantial amount of plant growth regulators to achieve bold size and intercultural operations in this variety are very labor intensive which has to be carried out frequently to get better crop. Grape grower has to invest Rs. 50,000 - 60,000 per acre per season on such inputs which leads to huge rise in cost of cultivation. This situation is the representative picture of all the varieties grown in country. Such a expenditure can be saved by introducing new varieties which will give desired quality grapes without use of growth regulators. Despite of intensive efforts export quality produce of grape was only 1.98 lakh MT during 2016-17 (APEDA, 2017) which is merely about 7% of total grape production. There is a scope to increase exports. Only handful varieties under cultivation in country leads to monotony leaving us with fewer options for grape marketing.
