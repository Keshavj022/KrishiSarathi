 Dwarf coriander: A unique dwarf (25-30 cm) coriander genotype with early maturity (20-25 days early) suitable for intercropping in vegetable has been identified. Sowing of dwarf coriander at 20 cm row spacing with 20 and 30 kg/ha seed along with 125% of RDF gave significantly superior seed yield of 17.2 and 16.8 q/ha, respectively. This genotype of coriander has also been validated at farmers’ field at different locations in Rajasthan.
