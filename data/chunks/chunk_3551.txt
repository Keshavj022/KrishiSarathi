 As the fruit matures, acidity decreases and insoluble carbohydrate and protein content increases. Understanding these physico-chemical changes Table 1.

Identification of optimum stage of maturity in avocado Avocado fruits are harvested based on various maturity standards in different parts of the world. However, fat content is the most widely used maturity index by majority of the avocado growers. In general, total soluble solids and acidity decrease while carbohydrates, protein and fat content increase with advancement in fruit growth and development. The specific gravity will be higher at immature stage and gradually decrease during the growth phase (Table 1). Among all the parameters, March–April 2024 25 Different stages of growth and development of avocado fruits 30 DAFS 120 DAFS 60 DAFS 140 DAFS 90 DAFS 150 DAFS specific gravity of 1.00 could be used as a non-destructive maturity index while fat content can be taken as destructive maturity index. The ideal harvesting period for commercial purposes is between 140-150 DAFS, when avocado is grown under Bengaluru/Tumakuru, Karnataka conditions. General tips for identifying the optimum stage of maturity in avocado Skin colour: The most common variety, Hass changes colour as they mature. It is usually green when unripe and turn purplish-black as they mature. However, the colour alone is not always a reliable indicator, as some fruits may still be firm and unripe even when they have turned dark. Stem method: Easy detachment of the small stem or cap at the top of the avocado fruit with green surface underneath the stem indicates that the fruits are matured.
