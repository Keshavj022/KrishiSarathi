 Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor): A total of 22000 accessions of sorghum germplasm were characterized at ICAR-IIMR–Hyderabad with three checks, viz. Indian Farming 73 (01): 56-60; January 2023 Panicle diversity of sorghum germplasm resources conserved at ICAR-IIMR, Hyderabad Indian Farming 57 January 2023 Diversity among different millet germplasm resources conserved at ICAR-IIMR, Hyderabad M35-1, CSV 19R and CSV 27 in an Augmented Block Design. Data on 9 quantitative and 16 qualitative traits were collected. The plant height was the most variable character followed by grain weight and days to 50% flowering. A total of 106 accessions were identified for early flowering (<50 days), 319 for higher grain yield (>100.00 g/plant) and 297 for more 100-seed weight (>4.50 g). Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum): A total of 2016 accessions of pearl millet augmented from TNAU-Coimbatore were characterized at ICAR-IIMR, Hyderabad and data on 9 quantitative and 13 qualitative traits were collected. Total 62 accessions were identified for early flowering with less than 50 days and 25 accessions were identified for higher grain yield per plant with more than 35 g/plant. leaf blade length. Total 13 accessions were identified with early flowering (<50.00 days), 64 were identified with higher grain yield (>90.00 g/plant) and 11 were identified with more 100-seed weight (>1.20 g). Panicle diversity of pearl millet germplasm resources conserved at ICAR-IIMR, Hyderabad Finger millet (Eleusine coracana): A total of 5400 accessions were characterized for 14 quantitative and 18 qualitative traits. The grain yield per plant was the most variable trait followed by days to 50% flowering and Panicle diversity of finger millet germplasm resources conserved at ICAR-IIMR, Hyderabad Foxtail millet (Setaria italica): A total of 2580 accessions were characterized for 11 quantitative and 19 qualitative traits. The plant height was the most variable Panicle diversity of foxtail millet germplasm resources conserved at ICAR-IIMR, Hyderabad Indian Farming 58 January 2023 trait followed by grain yield and days to 50% flowering. Total 97 accessions were identified with early flowering (<40.00 days), 41 with higher grain yield (>70.00 g/plant) and 79 with more 100-seed weight (>0.35 g).
