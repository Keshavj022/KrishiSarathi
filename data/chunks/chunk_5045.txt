But when kept in sheetal after throwing the spoilage, about 820 g bhindi remained fit for consumption. The colour shine and hardness also did not change much. There were no shrinkage and dryness. On the third day, bhindi was almost fresh when kept in sheetal. The point to be noted is that when kept in sheetal some bhindi was spoiled due to high humidity inside the pot. In fact some water also comes into it, which spoil the vegetable. Pointed gourd (parwal): In pointed gourd also the results were encouraging. The weight of parwal was reduced to almost one third on the fifth day (368 g) when kept outside sheetal. But when kept in sheetal the weight remained about 750 g on the fifth day. About 200 g weight was reduced and there was 50 g spoilage. Parwal kept outside was completely unfit for consumption on the fifth day. It was shrinkes and dried. The colour and shining changed completely. But 800 g parwal that, remained in sheetal looked almost fresh, hard, without shrinkage and with some shine. It was fit for consumption. Similarly, on the third day the weight of parwal remained almost half (550 g) when kept outside. There was shrinkage. However, it was fit for consumption. The vegetable kept in sheetal, showed the weight loss only 160 g on the third day. There was no change in colour, hardness and shine. It was almost fresh. CONCLUSION Experimental results based on five experiments in winter and 10 in summer suggest that sheetal can be used for storing vegetables for home consumption for about 5 days. The ITK is more effective during summer.  HORTICULTURAL CROPS  Code : 239 Title of the ITK : Enhancement of onion productivity Description of the ITK : By applying 75 kg fresh Cassia leaves mixed with 125 kg cowdung, bulb size and onion yield is increased by 25â€“ 30%. Improvement in onion bulb colour may be from light red to dark red if this mixture is applied. This is best suited under irrigated condition for a local variety of onion. Best season is rabi. Depth of sowing may be 10 cm. Five farmers are using this technology for more than 10 years. Name and address of the discloser : Shri S.
