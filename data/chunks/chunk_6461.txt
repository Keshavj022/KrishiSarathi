 Therefore, CSR 65 (CSR B 31) showed promise as basmati line with sodicity tolerance. CSR 65 (CSR B 31) could be used in further improvement in increasing basmati rice yields under salt-affected soils. CSR 95 (CSR 189-11-122)-SaltolQTL introgressed line governing tolerance to salt stress: Tolerance at the seedling stage of a crop is essential for crop survival and establishment under salt-stress conditions. FL478 (RIL of IR29 × Pokkali) is a seedling stage salt tolerant variety having a major QTL called saltol. CSR 95 (CSR 189-11- 122) was developed by a marker-assisted backcrossing approach with sensitive variety Sarjoo52 as a recurrent parent and FL478 as a donor for saltol QTL (Sarjoo52 / FL478 // Sarjoo52 *3). The NIL, CSR 95 (CSR 189- 11-122) and seven sister lines positive for saltolQTL linked markers RM3412 and AP3206 were examined under glass house (ECiw = 10.0 dS/m) and micro plot saline (ECe = 8.0 dS/m) environments from 2019 to 2021. CSR 95 (CSR 189-11-122) performed admirably throughout the season, with the lowest salt injury score (3.00), identical to FL478. In addition to seedling stage tolerance, it possesses desired agronomic qualities such as medium duration (130-135 days), dwarf culture, with green leaves, medium thin grains, and full panicle CSR 65 (CSR B31) for sodicity tolerance in basmati background: Line CSR 65 (CSR B 31) is a basmati line, with high-yielding and long slender grain, developed from the cross of TRY 1/ Pusa Basmati 1. This dwarf culture has a medium duration (130–135 days), green foliage, slender grains, and full panicle exertion. It has a strong aroma, HRR (64.1%), ASV (7), AC (24.4%), GC (25 mm), and all basmati quality attributes. The line CSR 65 (CSR B 31) was found superior in yield over Pusa Basmati-1 (yield check), Pusa Basmati-1121 (yield check and quality check), Taroari Basmati (quality ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 105 SOIL AND WATER PRODUCTIVITY Optimising agronomy of quinoa in water scarce shallow basaltic soil region Optimising agronomy of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) in a new agro-ecological region needs strategies related to sowing time and management of water and nutrients. Under water scarce shallow basaltic regions, sowing of quinoa in the first week of November with 40% ETc and N dose of 100 kg/ha will give higher seed yield (14 q/ha), protein yield (217 kg/ha), water productivity (0.85 kg/m3) with net return of ₹ 70,000/ha. exertion. As a result, line CSR 95 (CSR 189-11-122) was nominated to the AICRP AL and ISTVT trials on rice and assessed in saline (ECiw = 10.0 dS/m) and alkaline (pH29.5) environments. This line CSR 95 (CSR 189-11- 122) was found to give yield superiority over CSR 36 (alkali check), CSR 23 (inland saline check), CSR 10 (early duration saline check), FL 478 (saline tolerant check), Pusa 44 (sensitive check) and Local check by 3.80%, 18.15%, 44.61%, 38.76%, 68.99%, and 4.26%, respectively under various high salinity and alkaline conditions during 2021.
