In Dendrobium, new growths appear along a rhizome and usually in the opposite direction of old growths. Therefore, the plant should be placed close to one edge of the pot, so that some room may be left on the opposite side of the pot for the new growths. While potting, plant should be held in such a way that the junction of roots and lower leaves flush on the top of the pot. For best results, potting media needs to be well moist (but not dripping wet). Potting should be done in such way, that the leaves should not touch the potting media and the top roots a little exposed. Yellow, shrivelled leaves, diseased part of the leaves should be trimmed. If necessary, the plants should be staked so that it does not wobble.
