 On an average, the vermin-wash has been produced 135-150 liters per unit, annually, from which the beneficiaries may gain a monetary benefit of ` 2,700 to 3,000 per unit per year. The cumulative estimated benefit for all 25 vermicomposting beneficiaries has been derived between ` 1,87,500 to ` 2,25,000 approximately. Doubling farmers income through LRI based crop performances Based on PRA technique of socio- economic survey among the farmers, it has been assessed that the farmers could get an approximate annual net returns from crops of ` 71,556 with average annual benefit to cost ratio of 1.60 only (Table 2) from existing low input management. LRI technology offered the land use managers the options for right crops. Moreover, it bestows crop Vermicomposting programme diversification in previously mono- cropped zones. Improved/ high yielding variety of crops along with best management practices (BMP) appears to increase yield, benefit to cost ratio (B-C) ratio and net returns by many-folds. The average yield gain has been estimated by 42.0% in LRI technology based crop performances. The average B-C ratio was 2.62 with an beneficial impact of 63.8% over existing system, while, the agro-technology conferred an average annual net returns of `1,51,495 with an enhanced impact of 112% over the existing sets of management (Table 2). SUMMARY Henceforth, LRI based agro- technology transfer appears to be superior over the conventional farming approach earlier adopted by the farmers in the lower Gangetic delta region. Considering fragility of the coastal ecosystem in West Bengal, the present endeavour will help the land use policy makers as a standard agricultural land use planning guide under similar climatic and physiographic situation in the elsewhere of the country. *Corresponding author email: siladitya_555@yahoo.co.in Table 2.
