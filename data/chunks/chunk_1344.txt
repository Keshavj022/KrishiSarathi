 His holistic approach to farming embodies a harmonious blend of tradition, hard work, and innovation in rural agriculture. In the kharif season of 2021, he cultivated okra on two kanals of land on the recommendation of the FFP team. The good returns from okra cultivation motivated him to expand this crop. Each year, he increased the area under okra, and by the kharif season of 2023, he was cultivating okra on five kanals, earning a net profit of `36,125. For the kharif season of 2024, he made a bold decision to replace his maize crop on a 12-kanal portion of his land with okra, shifting from a traditional crop to a more commercial one. His maize crop had previously suffered severe damage from wild animals, prompting him to rethink his planting strategy. By growing okra, Shri Pritam aims to meet rising market demand and secure better financial returns for his labour and investment. Indian Farming 36 October 2024 Average area under okra and maize crop okra maize 2024 2023 Year 2022 0 2021 1 1.76 2 1.65 2.075 2.75 3 4 5 5.16 5.44 6 6.37 6.31 7 This strategic shift proved highly successful, as wild animals tend to avoid okra crops due to the spines that cause irritation when they enter okra fields. Moreover, it has economic benefits over maize cultivation, as it yields better financial returns. The average net income per hectare from maize was only ₹ 34,139, while the average net income per hectare for okra cultivation was ₹ 1,36,500. Thus, this intervention provided double benefits to the farmers; it minimized damage to maize crops grown adjacent to okra fields, and replacing maize with okra provided an economic advantage. Furthermore, the intervention opened new opportunities for farmers in the adopted and neighbouring villages who were vulnerable to wild animals. The remarkable success achieved has sparked interest among more farmers in the village to venture into okra cultivation for the upcoming season. Impact Shri Pritam Chand, a farmer from a rural village, had traditionally cultivated maize during the kharif season. However, his crops were frequently damaged by wild animals such as monkeys, wild pigs, and peacocks. In an effort to protect his crops and improve his income, Shri Chand decided to switch to cultivating okra, a vegetable not preferred by wild animals. This innovative approach proved successful, he not only protected his crops from damage but also earned a higher income than with traditional maize cultivation. His fellow farmers were impressed by his success and began adopting the same strategy in their fields. Shri Chand’s story serves as an inspiration to other farmers facing similar challenges, demonstrating that innovative thinking and a willingness to try new approaches can lead to significant improvements in crop yields and income. CONCLUSION The strategic shift from maize to okra cultivation in wild animal-prone areas has proven beneficial for farmers in Samba, Jammu, and Kashmir.
