 Effi- cient water management also involves the use of moisture- retaining practices, such as mulching and cover cropping. Mulching helps to retain soil moisture by reducing evapo- ration, while cover crops can improve soil structure and water infiltration. These practices reduce the need for fre- quent irrigation, lowering energy use and associated car- bon emissions. Therefore, in dryland regions, the adoption of efficient water management practices is not only essen- tial for reducing carbon footprints but also for enhancing the resilience of agricultural systems to climate change. Livestock Management Integrated Livestock Management: Integrated livestock management is an approach that combines crop and live- stock systems to optimize resource use, improve produc- tivity, and reduce environmental impacts, including car- bon footprints. This system encourages the recycling of nutrients, the efficient use of land and water resources, and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through sustainable practices. One of the key benefits of integrated livestock management is its ability to enhance nutrient cycling within the farm system. By using animal manure as a natural fertilizer for crops, farmers can reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers, which are a significant source of N2O-N emissions, a potent GHG. Manure not only provides essential nutrients but also improves soil organic matter and structure, enhancing soil carbon se- questration. This practice also helps in reducing the car- bon footprint associated with the production, transporta- tion, and application of chemical fertilizers. Efficient livestock systems are crucial in carbon farm- ing, particularly in reducing methane emissions, a signifi- cant greenhouse gas. Gerber et al. (2013) highighted im- proved livestock management practices, including Diet manipulation and addition of concentrates as feed addi- tives for the mitigates enteric CH4 production while low dietary crude protein and ruminally degradable protein concentration can reduce NH3 emissions from manure. Besides, rotational grazing and improved manure manage- ment are effective strategies for reducing methane emis- sions in livestock systems. By moving livestock periodi- cally across different pastures, rotational grazing not only prevents overgrazing but also promotes vegetation re- growth, thereby enhancing pasture productivity and in- creasing carbon sequestration in grasslands. These prac- tices contribute to the accumulation of soil organic carbon, as root biomass and organic matter from manure are incor- porated into the soil. Manure incorporation lowers NH3 emission. Additionally, optimizing water use through the treatment and reuse of wastewater from livestock opera- tions for irrigation can further reduce the carbon footprint.
