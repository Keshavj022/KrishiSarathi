 Comparison of Model Performance Ratio (MPR) for scenarios A-D by farm size. MPR: 1 indicates the model perfectly replicates observed data (red line); MPR > 1 signifies overestimation; MPR < 1 signifies underestimation. Note: Y-axes change for each graph.

Marginal farmers may be more likely to use self-satisficing and social-normer heuristics to adopt climate tolerant varieties to manage and adapt to climate-related risks because their decisions may not be necessarily geared towards increasing profit, unlike larger farmers. This is a key insight for policy interventions aimed at improving the adoption of climate resilient practices such as climate tolerant varieties: economic or productivity-focused interventions may, alone, not be successful at promoting the adoption of such adaptation strategies. Interventions that promote farm productivity in the short term (e.g., high yield varieties, enhanced fertilizers etc.) often do not consider the non-optimizing de­ cision-making considerations of farmers, such as ecological benefits for longer time horizons or risk averseness in climate risk and uncertainty (see Findlater et al., 2019). This may, in part, explain the relatively lower levels of adoption of climate related adaptation strategies amongst our sample compared to yield-enhancing adaptation strategies. For example, our sample data shows that the adoption of yield-enhancing adaptation strategies such as high yielding varieties (89.9 %), enhanced use of fertilizers (86.2 %) and land preparation (56.
