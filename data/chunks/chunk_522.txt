 In this study, they employed a tensiometer for the estimation of soil matric potential (SMP) for real- time irrigation systems. Tensiometer with a magnetic switch having switching capability at the desired soil matric potential (SMP), which sent a signal to the electrically operated tube-well and solenoid valve whenever the SMP fell below a predetermined critical level (15 kPa) in rice and (35 kPa) in wheat. The rice-wheat systemsâ€™ grain yields and irrigation water saving and productivity differed due to automated irrigation systems like ZT with subsurface drip (ZT-SSD), and ZT with surface drip (ZT-SD) over CT with flood irrigation (CT-F), ZT with flood irrigation (ZT-F). The results showed that no-till coupled with an automated drip irrigation system provided much greater rice- wheat yields than an automated flood-irrigated system. By adopting automated drip irrigation, farmers can increase up to 100% irrigation water productivity of rice over the conventional method. Benefits of automation in micro-irrigation Precision irrigation: Automation allows for real-time adjustment of irrigation based on factors like soil moisture, weather conditions, and crop needs. This leads to precise water application, preventing overwatering or underwatering. Resource efficiency: By delivering water and nutrients directly to plants, micro-irrigation reduces water wastage, fertilizers, and energy use. Labour savings: Automation reduces the need for manual monitoring and operation, saving labour costs and enabling farmers to manage larger areas efficiently. Yield improvement: Properly managed micro-irrigation systems lead to healthier plants and improved crop yields. Environmental benefits: Reduced water use and controlled nutrient application minimize environmental impacts, such as soil erosion and groundwater pollution. Challenges in automated micro-irrigation Cost: Initial investment in automation technology and micro- irrigation infrastructure can be a barrier for small and marginal farmers. Technical know-how: Farmers need training to effectively use and maintain automated micro- irrigation systems. Maintenance: Regular maintenance of sensors, controllers, and other components is essential for reliable operation. Policy and awareness: Government support, subsidies, and awareness campaigns can IoT-based automation drip irrigation Source: www.skyfilabs.com Automated sub-surface drip irrigation in rice-wheat rotation Source: Sidhu et al.
