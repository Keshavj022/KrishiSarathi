 I came to know only after the commercialisation of BN BT when complaints started coming in about the variations in pollen and petal colour, presences of non BT plants based on boll worm attack and presence of MON 531 event. 20. If no action was taken, why so please? Since Iwas not aware of the presence of MON 531 in transformed BN, no action was taken. &6 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Zimbra ANNEXURE-VII Zimbra RE: CrylAc-NRCP,B sonti@ccmb.res.in - .._--------_._- -_..__._----- -- .....-. ---------------_._--_.

A short stretch of OCS terminator got deleted (104 bp) which explains why we never got PCR amplification (based on OCS-terminator primer sequences). 2. Nos terminator and interstitial space got duplicated in reverted direction. I attached a PPT slide depicting the current status and features. The sequence files Wi!' be sent after arranging them in order. Sincerely Dr P; Ananda Kumar Project Director NRC on Plant Biotechnology IAR!

The progress is slow because of reasons associated with my RA's health and family problems. http://webQla!1.ccmb_res.inIzimbralh/printmess~e?icl'C4312J !if..
