 To ensure “more crop/income per drop of water”, special emphasis has been given for the cultivation of high value – less water intensive crops for effective land use system. The small size of land holdings inhibits investment in productivity enhancing measures and makes many agricultural holdings sub-optimal. 493 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Such type of holdings challenges the process of marginalization of small and marginal farmers and casualization of agricultural laborers. To derive the best results and to empower them, these farmer groups have to be motivated either to form farmer’s groups or some type of institutional arrangements so as to get all the technical inputs in time and to ensure judicious use of various scarce resources. Thus, agriculture sector continues to confront with the shrinkage of area under cultivation, gross mismatched between the drawal and recharge of ground water, growing conversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural uses that made disparities in yield rate of crops across the State, imbalanced application chemical fertilizers and the dominance of small and marginal farmers. Water Use Efficiency (WUE) has to be increased by enhancing productivity of per unit of water for which strategies such as mass adoption of Micro Irrigation Mission approach, promotion of Precision Farming, SSI, SRI and Rainwater Harvesting structures for recharging groundwater are to be promoted. B. Horticulture Major initiatives for increasing the area acreage and productivity were taken up in the form of cultivation, rejuvenation of old orchards, canopy management, organic farming, post- harvest management, creation of marketing infrastructure and human resource development. The major challenges are:   Horticultural Parks for fruits, vegetables and spices have to be developed across the State.   More thrust has to be given to micro irrigation with fertigation.   Expansion of area under precision farming,   Hi-density planting   Organic cultivation wherever possible to meet the demand from niche markets andconsumers through which income earning capacity of the farmer water can be enhanced.   More emphasis on value addition by creating value addition centres and establishment of localized training to the farmers accordingly. C. Agricultural Engineering and Mechanization In Tamil Nadu mechanization in agriculture is still limited to usage of tractors and motor pumps. The challenges in promotion of mechanization include non-standardized agricultural practices, atomistic land holdings, low investment capacity of farmers, lack of know-how and non- availability of service and maintenance facilities. Suitable policy and structural mechanisms have to be developed and support increased mechanization in all phases of agriculture.
