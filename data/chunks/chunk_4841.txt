 Additionally, they enhance water and nutrient-use efficiency, supporting sustainable practices while enabling year-round production for continuous supply. Soilless cultivation, while advantageous, comes with several limitations. It requires a high initial investment, which can be a barrier for small-scale or resource-limited growers. The systems are also highly technical, demanding specialized knowledge and skills for effective setup and operation. Additionally, soilless cultivation requires precision surveillance to monitor and maintain optimal nutrient levels and environmental conditions, adding to the operational complexity and oversight needed for successful implementation. Effective management of a soilless system relies on several key components. First, the design and suitability of the protected structure, as well as the type of soilless or hydroponic setup, are crucial to ensure optimal growth conditions. Choosing suitable crops and varieties tailored for soilless cultivation enhances productivity, while implementing advanced production and protection technologies safeguards plant health. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) are essential to maintain sustainable and safe practices. An efficient fertigation system, along with carefully scheduled protocols, ensures precise nutrient delivery, while artificial light management supports plant growth under controlled conditions. Lastly, using fertigation and climatic sensors enables automation, allowing precise monitoring and adjustment of environmental factors for consistent crop performance. Application of sensors in automated soilless cultivation Machine learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial intelligence (AI) based automation have been the recent most successful approaches for controlling soilless cultivation-based greenhouses and urban farming models for maximizing the quality crop production of high value vegetables, flowers and seedlings as well as Soilless cultivation of tomato inside greenhouse Table 1.
