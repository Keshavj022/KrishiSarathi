These enterprises play an important role in society by generating employment opportunities, bringing demographic shifts, and inspiring future generations of farm women. One such example is Smt. Pinky Devi from a small village in the Solan district of Himachal Pradesh. She is a role model in her area for adopting sustainable agricultural practices and promoting millet recipes. She grows various cash crops like tomato, capsicum, pea, and cauliflower under a natural farming system, achieving higher net returns compared to chemical farming. Her commitment to healthy soil builds a sustainable agricultural system. By growing crops without chemical fertilizers and pesticides, Smt. Pinky Devi is improving soil health and increasing bioturbation, enhancing water-holding capacity and soil porosity. Keywords: Millet, Natural farming, Sustainable farming, Woman entrepreneur T HINGS may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.” This quote by Abraham Lincoln perfectly suits Smt. Pinky Devi, a successful woman entrepreneur from Dangri village, Solan District, Himachal Pradesh. She dreamed of earning well by farming her own land without using chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Determined to shift from chemical to non-chemical farming systems, she visited Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Solan, to learn about sustainable agriculture. After training, she planted apple orchards in 2018.
