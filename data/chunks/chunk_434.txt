Indian Farming 7 October 2023 with best management practices (Table 1). Impact analysis was made by comparing the B: C ratio and net returns from LRI based land use options with the existing traditional land use systems (Table 2). It was noted that average annual net returns for the farmers under existing system of land use with low input management was `38,655 with average annual benefit to cost ratio of 1.89 only. When, LRI based alternate land use options are adopted with best management practices (BMP), the farmers receives the plentiful options of crop diversification and amalgamation of crops with fishery and other allied components. The LRI based land use plan (with BMP) resulted an annual net returns (NR) of `74,693 with annual average B: C ratio of 2.28. As a consequence, impacts on net returns and B: C ratio over existing land use was revealed as 93.2% and 20.6%, respectively. Keeping in mind the diminishing returns from sugarcane in the region, the cash crop can be replaced by promoting Makkhana, organized fishery and integrated paddy-fishery in water bodies and low-lying depressed lands of meander plains, Tall and Diara lands. The results revealed that LRI based agricultural land use plan with best management practices would give rise to sharp enhancements in annual income of farmers towards boosting up farmers’ livelihood and maintaining a steady agricultural sustainability in the region without compromising soil health. SUMMARY Calcareous soils of Ushar lands of North Bihar under Indo-Gangetic plain were characterized for their management. High pH (> 8.5), high calcareousness (> 35%) and low organic carbon (< 0.5%) along with severe flood hazards and siltation are the major constraints for agricultural production. As per the land suitability assessment, crop diversification is highly promising in young alluvial plains. However, in meander plains and active flood plains (Tall lands), there have been certain physical and chemical limitations for crop choices. Impact assessment of soil resource inventory based land use plan with best management practice (BMP) has shown an increase in annual net returns by 93.2% and benefit to cost ratio by 20.6% from the traditional land use system with poor level of management. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: siladityabandyopadhyay@gmail.
