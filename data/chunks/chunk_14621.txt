089, 95% CI = 0.018, 0.162) and abundance (high certainty, β = 0.124, 95% CI = 0.065, 0.182) (Figure 4). Among long-distance migratory species, open-ground feeders benefited from a high proportion of semi-perennial crops (high certainty, β = 0.407, 95% CI = 0.056, 0.762) while the abundance of carnivorous species was negatively affected (low certainty, β = −0.632, 95% CI = −1.554, 0.078). The effect of a high amount of woody vegetation on overall bird species richness and abundance was in- conclusive for both resident and Palearctic migratory species. However, our guild-based abundance models for Palearctic migratory species indicated that their abundance was likely to be driven by the habitat and diet of the migratory species (Figure 5). The abundance of spe- cies preferring open ground (high certainty, β = −0.656, 95% CI = −1.031, −0.306) and carnivores (low certainty, β = −0.407, 95% CI = −1.199, 0.211) declined with an increase in woody vegetation, while that of shrub dwellers tended to increase (low certainty, β = 0.120, 95% CI = −0.047, 0.281) from it (Figure 5).

ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS 9 of 17 A high mean field size had a negative but rather weak effect on resident species richness (low certainty, β = −0.046, 95% CI = −0.109, 0.012) and abundance (low certainty, β = −0.033, 95% CI = −0.073, 0.005). The effect of mean field size was inconclusive for Palearctic migratory species, with a weak negative tendency for the abundance of carnivorous migratory species (low cer- tainty, β = −0.166, 95% CI = −0.644, 0.187) (Figure 4). DISCUSSION Globally, grassland ecosystems are threatened by agri- cultural intensification and expansion. Both processes are major drivers of the decline in grassland avifauna (Douglas et al., 2023). Structural and compositional com- plexity in agricultural landscapes characterized by a high amount of seminatural habitat, diverse crops, and small field sizes can play a significant role in halting and reversing these declines (Fahrig et al., 2015; Sirami et al., 2019).
