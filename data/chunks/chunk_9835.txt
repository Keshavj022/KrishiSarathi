 In case of limited availability of irrigation water, it can be restricted to one irrigation and should be at flower primordial stage or boot leaf stage depending on the soil moisture situation. Table 4. Critical growth stages of sorghum Critical stages Days after sowing Initiation of grand growth stage 20–25 Flag-leaf stage or boot stage 50–55 Flowering stage 70–75 Grain-filling stage 90–100 Soil-moisture conservation practices for rabi sorghum • Deep ploughing with mould board plough followed by 3–4 harrowing during summer (May–June) helps to conserve rainwater in deeper soil layers for a longer period. • Compartmental bunding involves making square or rectangular compartments on the field to retain rain water and to arrest soil erosion in medium deep black soils. After receipt of early rains in June and Table 3. Pest and diseases identification symptoms and their management practices Key identification symptoms Control measures Insect pest Shoot fly Occurs in seedling stage, wilting and drying of central leaf appearing as ‘dead heart’ Sowing at the end of September to 1st week October, seed treatment with thiamethoxam 30 FS @3 g/kg and spray of cypermethrin 20 EC (200 ml/ha) or quinalphos 25 EC (400 g a.i./ha) or carbofuran granules (5–7 granules/plant) in leaf whorls during severe damage Stem borer Scratches on upper whorl leaving lower surface as transparent windows, dead heart symptoms in young plants due to early attack, peduncle tunnelling forming complete or partial chaffy panicles Uproot or burn the stubbles and remove stems/stalks to prevent carryover and apply carbofuran 3 G @8–12 kg a.i./ha at 20–35 DAE* in whorls Shoot bug Heavy infestation during rabi, when it rains in seedling stage, nymphs and adults suck sap causing yellowing and reduced plant vigour, young leaves start drying extending to older leaves in severe cases or sometimes plant death occurs Remove alternate host grasses, soil application of dimethoate 0.03% and neem seed kernel suspension 0.04%+soap Aphids Adults and nymphs feed leaves and suck the sap at boot stage causing poor panicle exertion, yellowish blotches and necrosis appears during heavy infestation Application of dimethoate 0.03% and neem seed kernel suspension 0.
