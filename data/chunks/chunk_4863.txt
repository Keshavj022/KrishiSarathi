 Heat stress, exacerbated by rising temperatures, disrupts plant metabolism, leading to premature leaf senescence and reduced fruit quality, thereby affecting crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Digital technologies offer novel ways to manage abiotic stress challenges and enhance crop resilience. Tools such as remote sensing, the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and decision support systems (DSS) are transforming how farmers monitor and mitigate environmental stress. IoT-based sensors monitor critical factors such as soil moisture and temperature, enabling precise irrigation adjustments to prevent drought stress. Drones equipped with advanced imaging technologies provide real-time, high-resolution data on plant health and soil conditions, allowing for targeted interventions. They are particularly effective in Indiaâ€™s diverse agro- climatic zones, helping to optimize resource use and reduce input waste. Additionally, drones with thermal imaging and precision sprayers assist in mitigating heat stress and nutrient deficiencies by delivering localized treatments. Remote sensing, combined with AI and machine learning, further enhances stress management by offering broad landscape-level insights and early detection of stress symptoms. Despite the transformative potential of these technologies, barriers, such as high costs, regulatory hurdles, and the need for skilled operators, remain. Overcoming these challenges through government support and training is essential for scaling up digital tools in Indian horticulture, ultimately improving crop resilience, productivity, and sustainability. Emerging technologies, such as IoT, drones, and precision agriculture, offer potential solutions to these challenges by providing early detection and tailored real-time interventions to help Indian horticulture adapt to environmental stresses and ensure sustainable productivity. The Indian horticulture industry plays a crucial role in ensuring national food and nutritional security, yet it faces significant challenges from abiotic stressors, including drought, salinity, extreme temperatures, and irregular rainfall, which are exacerbated by climate change. These stress factors negatively affect crop yield and quality, threatening farmers' livelihoods. To mitigate these effects, digital technologies such as remote sensing, the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and drones offer innovative solutions. These technologies enable real- time monitoring, early detection, and targeted interventions to reduce stress and improve crop resilience. Remote sensing and GIS aid in monitoring and managing stress by analyzing environmental factors and crop conditions, while IoT systems optimize irrigation through precise adjustments based on real-time data. Drones equipped with advanced sensors help detect stress and apply interventions like nutrient delivery and water management, particularly in diverse agro-climatic zones.
