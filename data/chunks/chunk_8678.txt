0 – – – DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 170 On-farm Testing Technologies (296) were identified for on-farm testing by the KVKs to evaluate and assess its impact on location-specific basis in different farming systems including varietal trials (111), cropping systems (27), nutrient management (108), pest and disease management (35) and weed management (15). Integrated management of Phalaris minor in wheat: On-farm trial was conducted in Gurdaspur, Punjab, with 3 dates of sowing and two varieties (PBW 343, WH 542), two planting patterns (15 cm, 22.5 cm) and two weed control treatments (un- weeded check, Isoproturon 0.94 kg/ha in sub-plots). Wheat sown on 25 October gave 16.1 and 38.7% higher grain yield over 10 November and 25 November respectively along with reduction in dry-matter accumulation by Phalaris minor over 10 November. The crop sown at closer spacing (15 cm) gave significantly more yield than sown at normal spacing of 22.5 cm due to more suppression of P. minor. The varieties PBW 343 and WH 542 did not show any difference in dry- matter production of P.minor and grain yield of wheat. Further, the crop sown on 25th October maintained superiority in suppressing the weed even without the application of isoproturon as compared to 10 November sowing with application of isoproturon 0.94 kg/ha.

The clipping of Basmati 45 days after transplanting (DAT) along with application of 125 kg N/ha gave the highest average yield of 2.98 tonnes/ha which was 46.1% higher than the unclipped plots with normal dose of 62.5 kg N/ha. Foliage clipping only once at 45 DAT with 125 kg N/ha produced 17.
