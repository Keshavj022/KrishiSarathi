There is scope for further expansion by promoting in suitable areas.   Area as well as yield of sorghum and chick pea are going down.   Area under pigeon pea, green gram and groundnut are going down in spite of positive growth rate in yields. (B) Central Telangana Zone   Area under cotton is showing increasing trend in response to better market for the commodity though yield is showing declining trend (Table 8 ).   Both area and yield are showing increasing trend in maize   Area under rice is declining despite positive growth rate in yield.   All other important crops except soybean are loosing area. Soybean area in the zone is slowly picking up.   Growth rate in yield is positive for mango, soybean, groundnut, green gram, chick pea and sorghum while it is not encouraging for pigeon pea and chillies. 540 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 (C) Southern Telangana Zone   Rapid growth was observed in area under cotton in last 10 years despite slight decreasing trend in yield.
