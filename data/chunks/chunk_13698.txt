Financing Sustainable Agriculture in India Partha Sarathy Adhya1 and Suresh Kumar Sahoo2 1 Faculty of Management Studies, Sri Sri University, Cuttack - 754006, Odisha, India 2 Faculty of Management Studies, Sri Sri University, Cuttack - 754006, Odisha, India par.adhya@gmail.com Abstract. Climate-resilient agriculture has mostly been financed by public funding ventures, which include state and central governments, and multilateral R&D finance institutions, through climate finance instruments such as grants, loans, and long-term equities. However, in the backdrop of a rapid pace of cli- mate change and inadequate public resources for attracting private capital to- wards projects harping on sustainable agriculture, numerous alternate represen- tations to entice private capital are being conceptualized. By bringing together time-tested instruments with risk mitigation options, we can strive to produce an attractive risk–return profile, which would subsequently boost the involve- ment of the private sector (“crowding in”). As per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals framework, SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) prioritizes sustainable agriculture. The clauses 2.3 and 2.4 of SDG 2 explicitly highlight productivity, resilience and sustainability. SDG 2.4 specifies marshalling investment towards resilient agriculture. Sustainable agri- culture is also linked to other SDGs like reduction of poverty, climate change, water use, equality of gender, sustainable production, and consumption.
