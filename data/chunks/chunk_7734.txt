 The saving in labour with developed transplanter over manual transplanting of tomato, brinjal and chilli seedlings is 85, 86 and 86%, respectively, whereas saving in cost is about 24, 31 and 29%, respectively. Sprayer to control whitefly in cotton crop: The cotton crop is cultivated in an area of 0.67 million ha in Haryana with production of 1.63 million bales but damages due to whitefly attack causes reduction of plant growth and crop yield in Haryana. A prototype of sprayer equipped with electro-pneumatic system was developed. It consists of suction unit, electric unit and prime mover for pneumatic unit. The pneumatic unit creates turbulence dislodging the whitefly from cotton plants, using suction and forward thrust of air pressure to trap insects. The Vertical cup-type vegetable transplanter for cell feed nursery MECHANIZATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 88 electric unit kills trapped insects. Its field testing indicated 42, 40 and 38% reduction in whitefly at 860, 760 and 550 PTO rpm, respectively. Intra-cum-inter row weeder for orchards: The tractor operated intra-cum-inter row costly weeders are imported in India and are used by a few grape and pomegranate growers. A low hp tractor operated intra- cum-inter row weeder was developed. The overall dimension of the machine is 1070 × 700 × 800 mm. It is easy to extend and retract the rotary unit by swiveling action of hydro-mechanically controlled sensor. It was tested in farmers’ orchard (2 ha) of pomegranate in Ahmednagar district and grapes orchard (1.5 ha) in Nashik district. The effective field capacity of the machine is 0.17 ha/h with 89% field efficiency in pomegranate orchard and 0.15 ha/h with 81% field efficiency in grape vineyard. The weeding efficiency of the machine is about 95%. There is net saving of ` 1,775/ ha and ` 1,480/ha in pomegranate and grape vineyard, respectively, over traditional method. Ginger harvester-cum-elevator: Ginger is cultivated in an area of 29,300 ha with total production of 109,300 tonnes in Karnataka. The conventional method of harvesting ginger rhizome is labour intensive (240 man- h/ha), which increases total harvesting cost due to higher wages during peak season. A tractor operated ginger harvester-cum-elevator was developed. The overall dimension of machine is 1.88 ×1.55 × 1.15 m. It consists of digging blade, ground wheel and elevator. The conveying system is provided with arrangement for removal of soil clods in between mild steel rods. The maximum soil separation index was found at 20° angle of elevator. The maximum conveying efficiency of 99.7% is observed at 1.25 speed ratio of elevator and 20° angle of elevator. The effective field capacity and field efficiency of the harvester is 0.18 ha/h and 82%, respectively. The cost of operation using developed equipment is ` 910/ha as compared to ` 2,205/ha in manual digging.
