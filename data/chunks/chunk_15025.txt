 In addition, the village-level REDS questionnaire in- cludes demographic variables as well as information on existing road infrastructure and distance to various amenities. Importantly, the restricted REDS data contains village-level iden- tifiers that allow me to match the household panel to PMGSY ad- ministrative records. The Online Management & Monitoring System (OMMS) is an online reporting system used by program administration to track and monitor road works. I match the REDS villages to the OMMS database in order to observe village connectivity status and population size at baseline (which determine program eligibility), dates at which a program road was sanctioned and a work order was issued, costs associated with a program road, length of a program road and information on other villages connected by the program road. My matched sample consists of 4246 households from 221 villages. I use three other datasets in this paper. I use the India Place Finder Hamlets database, which contains the universe of geocoded natural villages,14 to construct treatment and control groups as described in Section 5. I also use remote sensing data on night time luminosity at the village level from the Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural– Urban Geographic Dataset on India (Henderson et al., 2011; Asher et al., 2019), along with the 1991, 2001 and 2011 Primary Census Abstracts (PCA), which contain key village-level demographic variables such as total population and worker counts across broad employment categories, to validate the parallel trends assumption underlying my empirical strategy. 12 I also use the REDS 1982 wave (which precedes the wave in 1999) to validate the parallel trends assumption underlying my empirical strategy — I discuss this in Section 6.1. 13 I follow Munshi and Rosenzweig (2016), who perform a similar aggregation with the 1982 and 1999 rounds of the REDS. 14 This can be publicly accessed at http://india.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/, courtesy of the Mizushima Laboratory, Department of Oriental History, Graduate School of Humanities and Sociology, The University of Tokyo.

Empirical strategy 5.1. Defining treatment and control groups Fig. 1 summarizes the timeline over the study period. I observe households in 1999, prior to the start of PMGSY. The program launched in December 2000, and road construction commenced in 2001. I then observe households again in 2006.15 During this period, road construc- tion was restricted to unconnected villages with a population greater than 500, hereafter referred to as eligible villages.16 I study two types of connections made under the program. The first, which I refer to as a direct connection, exploits variation in the timing at which eligible villages were exposed to new program roads.
