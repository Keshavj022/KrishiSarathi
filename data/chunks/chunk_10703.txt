Further, we could say that, the dip in total pesticide production observed in 2019-20 is mainly due to the decreased production of fungicides and insecticides. Banning of various pesticide molecules in recent past could be the reason for registering the declined production. Percent share of different pesticide group for the year 2015-16 and 2019-20 showed more or less similar pattern in terms of percent share of production. Insecticides occupied the top position with more than 40% followed by fungicides with more than 30% in both the years. However, herbicides production share has increased from 17% in 2015-16 to 20% in 2019-20 whereas fungicides production share has declined from 37 % to 33 % during this period. Production Trend of key Herbicides in India Volume of production and compound annual growth rate of key herbicides produced in India is given in Table 3. Only the key herbicides for which time series data were available have been considered for this analysis. Perusal of the table indicates that all these key herbicides together recorded a compound annual growth rate of 6.3% during 2015-16 to 2019-20. Barring Glyphosate, all other herbicides showed a positive growth rate of production during this period. Of the six key herbicides, Metribuzin registered highest growth rate (30.68%) followed by Diuron (28.14%) and Pretilachlor (12.11%). In terms of volume production, 2,4- D contributed highest with more than 22 thousand MT followed by Glyphosate (5.9 thousand MT) and Diuron (3.4 thousand MT). SUMMARY Pesticide use in India is very low as compared to other countries. All group of pesticides and herbicides have an important role to play in Indian agriculture. Herbicides or chemical method of weed management is considered as the most effective tool to deal with the weed menace in crops. The pesticide market in India is one of the billion rupees markets of the country. Hence, understanding the production trend of various herbicides in relation to the other group of pesticides has great significance.
