Printed by: M/s Royal Offset Printers, A-89/1, Naraina Industrial Area, Phase-I, New Delhi 110028 I ndia has achieved a phenomenal growth in food grain production (308.65 million tonnes) during 2020-21 despite the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a testimony to country’s preparedness even during the odd times. It has been possible due to favourable government policies, untiring efforts of the farmers and use of technologies specifically large-scale cultivation of the improved varieties and hybrids. Despite the desired level of crop production over the years, our country faces numerous challenges. ‘Climate change’ has been the most worrying factor as occurrence of frequent drought and flooding, and appearance of new races of disease causing pathogens are resulting in significant crop losses. Further, ‘malnutrition’ caused by consumption of food inadequate in essential nutrients has emerged as a major health concern, which needs urgent attention. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has recognized the pressing need to develop crop cultivars with better resilience to various biotic and abiotic stresses and high nutritional quality. It gives me immense pleasure to mention that National Agricultural Research System (NARS) led by ICAR has made significant progress in marker-assisted breeding for development of crop cultivars having climate resilience and high nutritional value in less than half of the time required through traditional methods. This method popularly known as ‘Molecular Breeding’ has resulted in commercial release of 74 cultivars in crops like rice, wheat, maize, pearl millet, chickpea, soybean and groundnut. The information on cultivars developed through molecular breeding is being published in the form of second edition of the booklet entitled, ‘Crop Cultivars Developed Through Molecular Breeding’. I congratulate the developers of these varieties and appreciate ICAR for this initiative.
