41/year along with a highly significant increasing trend of 0.67 in NVSWI values. The lowest highly significant declining trends of −0.26/year and −0.27/year in groundwater level were recorded in the ACZ I of Punjab and Haryana, where irrigation is mostly restricted to surface water due to inland aquifer salinity and water logging conditions, thus reflecting the spo­ radic nature of groundwater-based irrigation. 4. Discussions From the above observations it can be inferred that meteorological drought varied spatio-temporally in all the ACZs. The results of SPI indicated that ACZ-III (hot sub humid) witnessed the maximum (6) number of drought events, while the least (4) drought events were experienced by ACZ-I (hot arid) at different time periods, but drought events from 2001 to 2003 were experienced by all the ACZs. From SPI 12 values, it could be concluded that ACZ III i.e., the hot sub humid zone witnessed more drought events than ACZ I and ACZ II. SPI-12 also covered the drought events of 1987 and 2002–03, which are well documented in the earlier studies (Saini et al., 2020). Rainfall as well as the soil water storage reflected a negative anomaly during 1987–88, 2002–03, 2004–07 drought events over Punjab and Haryana (Mukherjee et al., 2019), and the TCI in our present investigation indicates low soil moisture conditions in ACZ I from 2001-02 to 2010-11. Crop yield is eventually impacted by severe drought conditions during the growing Fig. 13.

Drought duration (DD), drought severity (DS), and drought intensity (DI) also varied across the ACZ. The spatial dis­ tribution maps of SPI and NVSWI also implied that areas that reflected the meteorological droughts during dry years in different ACZs also showed the agricultural droughts, however, in the ACZ III (hot sub-humid zone), discrepancies were observed. Different drought indices appear to measure the severity of the drought differently (Kundu et al.
