 Small farmers, who own between one and 2 ha, make up about half of the farming community across Indian states. These small-scale farmers face significant challenges, including inadequate transportation, insufficient market infrastructure, and limited input access. Agriculture supports 58% of the population and 70% of rural households (82% of farmers are small and marginal), producing 291.95 million metric tons of food in 2019–20 despite climate uncertainties (Borkar, 2019; FAO, 2023a). Despite achieving economic diversification and food self-sufficiency, India’s agricultural GDP share has diminished, while over ~190 million S. Sahoo et al.
