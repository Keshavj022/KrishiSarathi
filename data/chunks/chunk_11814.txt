97 x 1016 7.68 x 1017 Purchased resources 4.30 x 1016 7.68 x 1017 Total resource use 5.44 x 1016 7.87 x 1017 In contrast to the JalopcharTM, a comparable conventional sewage treatment technology was observed to be associated with far higher (98.26%) purchased non-renewable resource-emergy use. Amongst purchased non- renewable resources, the operational costs such as maintenance (48.10 %) and electricity (28.31 %) contributed the maximum (76.41 %) while the rest 23.59% was associated with the construction activities. As evident from table 6, the contribution of total emergy use from the non-renewable resource in a conventional technology was observed to be about 83 times more than the proposed technology solution of comparable capacity. Ecological Efficiency and Sustainability Chapter 4 JalopcharTM - An Eco-friendly Wastewater Treatment Technology 13 Ecological efficiency and sustainability analysis of the developed solution, in terms of a number of emergy indices (Table 7) further showed that it utilizes 27 times more renewable resource than a conventional technolgy and is thus 1500 times more sustainable than a conventional sewage treatment technolgy. The emergy sustainability index (Table 7) infact showed that the JalopcharTM technology is associated with 33 times lesser environmental stress than a comparable conventional sewage treatment technology. Table 7: Sustainability of JalopcharTM vs. conventional sewage treatment technology Emergy Indices JalopcharTM Conventional Tech. Emergy Yield Ratio 0.70 0.01 Environment Loading Ratio 1.37 42.19 Renewable Percentage 0.54 0.02 Emergy Sustainability Index 0.51 0.00034 A comparison of the JalopcharTM technology with a comparable conventional technology thus revealed clear electrical usage advantages as its electrical energy consumption was observed to be less than 0.3% of a comparable conventional system. The analysis also indicated that the developed solution requires simpler maintenance as the system has no demand for any consumables and largely relies on the ecological action of (native) microbes, media and plants for its efficacy. Contrary to a general belief that such technological solutions require more land area, the present analysis revealed that the conventional STP (comprising of actual treatment components* along with other support infrastructure viz. STP - control office/centrifuge buildings, chemical storage and panel rooms), has about 177 to 332 times larger land area requirement than the proposed technology based comparable wastewater treatment facility with no additional support infrastructure (such as control /chemical storage rooms etc.) requirements. Lower cost and higher use of local resources in such treatment systems thus makes them attractive solutions especially for those developing countries that have so far not invested in expensive centralized sewage infrastructure.
