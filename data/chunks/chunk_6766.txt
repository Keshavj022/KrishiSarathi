1 mg/kg); Maize resistant to turcicum blight; Wheat with high hectoliter (weight 80.4 kg/hl) and superior grain appearance; Barley with high beta glucan (7.5% dwb) and high protein (13.2%); Cotton with high ginning outturn percentage (43.9%); Cauliflower resistant to black-rot disease, carries single dominant resistant gene; Wild Bean highly resistant to bruchid; Tuberose with double flower type compactly arranged on short spike, more number of flowers open at a time (7.10) and resistant to root-knot nematode; Mango with polyembryony, tolerant to salt and regular bearing. PGR Map was launched for public use on 16 August 2021 by Honâ€™ble Minister for Agriculture, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar. PGR Clim was launched on 2 August 2021 during the 45th NBPGR Foundation Day by Prof. Paul Gepts, University of California, Davis. DNA Fingerprinting Plants: During the period under report, 96 samples of agri-horticultural crops were DNA profiled from different public and private sector organizations. The crops which were DNA profiled included Blackgram, Chickpea, Chilli, Cotton, Fababean, Greengram, Mustard, Oats, Seed Health Testing for Pest-free Conservation A total of 12,612 indigenous samples were processed for pest-free conservation and 2,869 samples were subjected to X-ray radiography. A total of 514 samples were infested with insect-pests; 602 samples were infected with different fungi; 280 samples of rice seeds were infected with nematode. Of the total infested/infected, 45 samples were rejected due to Tilletia carries in wheat, Tilletia barclayana in rice and Peronospora manshurica in soybean.
