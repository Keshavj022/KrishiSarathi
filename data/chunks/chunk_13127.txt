  Fertilization is external and females carry fertilized eggs in brood chamber under the abdomen for 10-15 days where colour of eggs change from orange to grey. Fecundity ranges from 3,500 to 80,000 nos/individual depending on size.  For seed production, the berried females carrying grey egg-mass are collected either from wild or pond and kept in indoor hatching tanks containing freshwater for hatching of eggs. Hatching occurs within 2-3 days.  The hatched out larvae are reared in the larval rearing tanks in the hatchery at salinity of 15-20‰ and fed 3-4 times freshly hatched Artemia nauplii initially. The quantity of Artemia nauplii is gradually reduced and supplemented with Moina and/or egg custard.  There are XI larval stages (zoea-I to zoea-XI), which takes 40-60 days, before they metamorphosed to post larvae. The post larvae are acclimatized to freshwater and reared for another 10 days before stocking in ponds.  The seed production technology is adopted mainly in the states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.

It grows up to 100 g in weight.  The sexes are separate with males having proportionately larger head, long and robust second walking legs than females. Breeds in freshwater in both flowing and captive waterbodies.  The breeding season extend from May to October. Fecundity ranges from 6,400 to 78,000 depending on the size. Fertilization is external. The fertilized eggs are incubated in the brood chamber of the female for 18-21 days on the ventral side of the abdomen. Colour of the eggs changes from orange to grey with embryonic development.  For seed production, the berried females having grey egg mass are procured from wild or rearing ponds/tanks and kept in hatching tanks in freshwater, where hatching occurs within 2-3 day.  The larvae require brackish water after hatching and hence they are shifted to another tank where salinity is increased gradually and finally maintained at 10-12%.  The larvae are fed on freshly hatched brine shrimp nauplii 3-4 times in the beginning and then gradually switched on to feeding on eggs custard. 30-40% tanks water is changed every day during tank cleaning.  Larvae metamorphose to post larvae (PL) within 22-30 days, which are reared for another 10 days in another tank before stocking in the nursery ponds/tanks.  The seed production technology developed by CIFA is yet to be adopted on commercial scale.
