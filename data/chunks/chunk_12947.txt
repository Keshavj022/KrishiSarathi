 Fresh potatoes: Per capita consumption of fresh potatoes (FAOSTAT) increased from 1991 to 2010 at an ACGR of 2.34%. Will this consumption rise in the future at the same rate? The stagnating growth rates of cereals’ productivity, large scale diversion of food grains to feed Potato production growth (%) over major potato producing nations and continents during TE 2003 and TE 2013 (Data source: FAOSTAT, 2015). 100 80 60 40 20 0 -20 Growth Rate (%) 30.41 84.89 -11.65 -1.76 -3.60 4.57 -10.40 -0.97 17.63 43.08 97.22 China India Russian Fed USA Germany Africa America Asia Europe Oceania World Potato heaps under shade Spray of CIPC on Heaps November–December 2019 7 and bio-fuel and expected steep rise in per capita consumption of pulses, edible oil, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar and non-vegetarian food in the regime of steadily rising population is bound to put pressure on existing cultivable land. Since, cultivable land is expected to remain more or less constant in the next 40 years, the role of crops like potato having higher production potential per unit land and time will become imperative. In this context potato crop has very high probability of making crucial contribution to the future national food security agenda. The perceived changes in Indian socio- economics in the medium and long term are expected to enhance per capita food consumption of fresh potatoes. Potato is an important ingredient of most of the fast foods in organised as well as unorganised sector. Rapid urban population growth from 375 to 840 million over next 40 years at an ACGR of 2.04% is expected against the overall national ACGR of population at 0.78%. Faster rise of number of nuclear families, higher disposable incomes on account of fast economic growth resulting into higher tendency of out- of-home eating and rapid increase in the number of working women in the medium and long run are expected to maintain the ACGR of 2.34% in per capita consumption of fresh potatoes. Per capita food demand of fresh potatoes at this ACGR will be 48.5 kg in the long term (Table 1). The corresponding national food demand for fresh potatoes will be 78.5 million tonne in 2050. Processing quality potatoes: Agri-processing sector experiences very fast growth rate when an economy transforms from developing to developed economy. The rise of Indian economy from $ 1.57 to between 13 and 34 trillion (under varied scenarios; NCAP estimates) is not possible without corresponding rise in agri- processing industry. Further, potato is always the front- runner when we take processing of agri-commodities into consideration. Analysis of past experience and Table 1.
