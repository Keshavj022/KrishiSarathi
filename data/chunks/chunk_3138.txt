 A granular jaggery (powder jaggery) making unit (cost Rs 10,000, capacity 100 kg/h) has been developed by Anakapalle centre having a recovery of 100 kg crystal jaggery from 1000 kg of cane. It can be used for table purpose like free‐flowing sugar. A process has been developed and standardized by Pantnagar centre for making jaggery chocolate, a novel confectionery product. Prepared from cocoa powder, milk powder, soy flour, butter and jaggery, it costs only Rs 5 per 50g piece of chocolate. 18 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Agricultural Engineering www.icar.org.in 3.3 BY‐PRODUCT UTILIZATION • Process technology for apricot kernel oil The process for extraction of apricot oil was standardized by Solan centre, comprising of mechanical decortication of apricot fruit stone, separation of kernels, followed by recovery of oil by expeller and filter press. Oil yield is about 122 litres (Rs 260 per litre) from 1000 kg apricot stones (Rs 15 per kg). The complete technology has been recently transferred to one SHG. For technology demonstration and custom service to the local farmers, 4 apricot oil extraction units have been established in 4 districts (Solan, Shimla, Kinnaur and Kullu) in HP. • Modified Chilli seed extractor Reciprocating sieve unit of the earlier prototype was replaced by a gyratory sieve (present capacity 100 kg chilli fruit per hour, cost Rs 38,500/‐). The technology has been transferred to a manufacturer and already 12 units have been sold at a cost of Rs. 43,000/‐ per unit. • Hybrid (solar / biomass / electrical) dryer for coconut A coconut dryer has been developed by Kasargod centre to dry 1500 nuts/batch in 3 days (cost Rs 70,000). The dryer can use solar energy, electrical heaters and combustion of coconut husk and coconut shell, individually or in combination, as the source(s) for heating the air. www.icar.org.in 19 2002 ‐ 2007 All India Coordinated Research Project on Renewable Sources of Energy for Agriculture and Agro Based industries 1.

Achievements during the Xth Plan Period 3.1 Solar tunnel dryer for Agro Industrial Applications Natural convection walk‐in type dryer useful for bulk drying of agricultural & industrial products at moderate air temperature. It consists of a hemi‐cylindrical metallic frame of 3.75m diameter & 2.0m height and is covered with UV stabilized transparent polythene sheet of 200 micron thickness. Length of the dryer depends upontype and quantity of the product to be dried per batch.
