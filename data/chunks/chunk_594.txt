 This integration of agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, fishery along with the establishment of Jalkund, a water harvesting structure to supplement irrigation to crops during rabi has become a significant farming option for the farmers to improve income and generate employment with higher system productivity while maintaining the health of soil and crops. IFS initiatives among Mizo farmers ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Mizoram Centre, Kolasib has initiated a project on improving farmers’ livelihood through scientific integration of farming components under Tribal Sub Plan programme at Saiphai village of Kolasib, Mizoram as the primary site for project intervention. After conducting participatory rural appraisal (PRA) in the selected village, the centre came up with four scientific IFS models to be implemented among the four selected farmers based on their location and available resources. These models included components like Agriculture (wetland and upland rice, maize, sweet corn), Silviculture (arecanut), Horticulture (vegetables like beans, rajma, cabbage, pumpkin, cucumber, brinjal, bitter gourd, etc. and fruits like dragon fruit, pineapple, papaya, banana), Animal husbandry (pig, goat, poultry), Fishery (rohu, catla, grass carp, silver carp, common carp and mrigal carp) and Water harvesting structures (jalkund, Table 1.
