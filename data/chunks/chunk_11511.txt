 1467), Varuna (T-59), Chhattisgarh Sarson-1, Indira Toria-1. Sowing of mustard should be done between 15th October to 15th November, optimum seed rate is 4-5 kg/ha. Before sowing, seed should be treated with Carbendazim @ 1.5-2 g/kg seed. 100 kg Nitrogen, 80 kg Phosphorus and 40 kg Potash is sufficient for good yield. Irrigation should be ensured at branching, flowering, and siliqua formation. Leaf blight is observed in some parts, for controlling the same, seed should be treated before sowing and apply Propeconazole @ 1 ml per litre of water and repeat the spray after 15 days. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 336 Safflower Following varieties have been found suitable for cultivation in Chhattisgarh- A-1, Naari N.H.-1, Naari H-15, H.U.S.-305, Manjeera, P.B.N.S.-12, Naari-6, P.B.N.S.-40, Parbhani Kusum, Phule Kusum (J.L.S.F.-414), S.S.H.-129, Naari-38, S.S.F.-658. In Chhattisgarh, 15th October to 15th November is the most optimum period for safflower sowing. Seed rate should be 10-15 kg/ha. Spacing between row-to-row sowing should be 45 cm. 90 kg Nitrogen, 40 kg Phosphorus and 30 kg Potash should be applied to fulfil the nutritive requirement of the crop. Lentil Lentil is also an important pulse crop which is grown in dorsa and kanhar soils. Suitable varieties are as follows- Lens-4076, I.P.L.-81 (Noori), J.L.-3, I.P.L.-316, R.V.L. 11-6, L-4717 (Pusa ageti Masoor), R.K.L.14-20 (Kota Masoor-2), L-4727, Kota Masoor-1 (RKL-607- 1), Chhattisgarh Masoor-1. Lentil should be sown between 15th October to 15th November, optimum seed rate is 40-45 kg / ha. Seed should be treated with Rhizobium and Trichoderma culture, P.S.B. @ 5-10 grams per kg seed, then after shade drying, sowing be completed. Optimum row to row spacing is 23-25 c.m. 20 Kg. Nitrogen, 40-50 kg Phosphorus, 20 kg Potash and 20 kg Sulphur should be applied for fulfilling nutritional requirement of the crop for potential yield. Fodder Crops Maize: Maize is a good fodder crop for well drained sandy loam soils under irrigated condition. It should be sown by the end of February in summer crop and October- November in rabi season crop. Seed rate should be 50-60 kg / ha with 100 kg Nitrogen, 40 kg Phosphorus and 40 kg Potash fertilizer / ha. Half dose of ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 337 Nitrogen should be given at sowing time, while remaining half at knee high stage. Following improved varieties are recommended for cultivation in Chhattisgarh- African Tall, Pratap Makka Chari â€“ 6, Vijay, G.F.- 405, J.- 1006. Fodder maize is sensitive for drought and water logging. During summer, irrigation should be given in 10-12 days interval and in rabi 15-20 days interval. Hybrid Napier Hybrid Napier is a multi-cut perennial fast growing fodder crop. Although maximum fodder production is harvested during rainy season and summer months. This fodder gives higher production, good quality and digestibility. During winter growth becomes slow.
