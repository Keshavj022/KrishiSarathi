 Mid-season drought at vegetative stage (1-15 August): Interculture to remove weeds and create dust mulch, Make conservation furrow, Wherever large gaps are found plant seedlings after receipt of rains, Apply N-fertilizer immediately after receipt of rain as booster dose Mid-season drought reproductive stage (16-31 August): Make dust mulch through interculture, Provide lifesaving irrigation, if possible Terminal drought (1-15 September): Harvest at physiological maturity, Prepare fields for rabi for sowing of Cowpea (KBC-2), sunflower, field bean, horsegram (PHG-9, BJPL-1, BGM-1) in October in Malnad and transition zones ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 177 Groundnut Delayed onset / deficit rainfall situation (15 June - 15 July): Sow groundnut varieties: JL-24, S-206, R-8808, R- 2001-3, ICP-8863, TS-3R, WRP-1, K6 and K9, ICGV-91114, KCG-6 Usually the sowing time in the state is the first week of July. However, if the rain is delayed beyond the first fortnight of July, sunflower is recommended as an alternative crop in northern Karnataka and crops like ragi, horsegram followed by bengal gram in southern Karnataka, Formation of dead furrows at 3.0 m intervals at 30-40 DAS. Early season drought (16-31 July): Thinning and gap filling with red gram, Interculture to remove weeds and create dust mulch, If still unsown due to deficit rainfall, prefer spreading varieties (DSG- 1, S-230), For the standing crop, inter row water harvesting and opening up of conservation furrow/ dead furrows using bullock drawn implements is recommended to conserve soil moisture Mid-season drought at vegetative stage (1-15 August): Interculture to remove weeds and create soil mulch, Earthing up and apply gypsum after receipt of rains, Life-saving irrigation (micro irrigation), Foliar spray of DAP (2%), Spraying of kaolin (4%) Mid-season drought reproductive stage (16-31 August): Interculture and weeding, mulching, Provide life-saving irrigation, Spraying of anti transpirant kaolin (4%), Removal of alternative row for fodder purpose Terminal drought (1-15 September): Life-saving irrigation, Plan for rabi crops horse gram (October month) in light soils; safflower, chickpea, sunflower, sorghum and Jayadhar cotton (October) in black soils. Harvesting of pods for table purpose Maize Delayed onset / deficit rainfall situation (15 June - 15 July): Sow maize hybrids; Vivek, Hema, Nityashree MAH-14-5, maize hybrid 9, Vivek maize hybrid 15, Vivek maize hybrid 21, Vivek maize hybrid 27, Pusa extra early hybrid Makka 5, Vivek QPM 9, Gap filling with seedlings raised in polythene bags, Apply pendimethiline + atrazin @ 0.
