The above-stated projections have been made assuming that practically it will be feasible to increase about 4 million ha additional area under pulses. Yield gap In most of the pulses, there is a huge gap between the potential yield and the realized yield. It is evident that the actual productivity of different pulses is considerably lower as compared to their potential yield as well as that realized on farm demonstrations (Table 5). One of the most important reasons behind low productivity in pulses is that these are generally grown in poor and marginal lands with minimum inputs. About 87% of the pulses cultivation in the country is rainfed. Many farmers still use old varieties and grow their home- saved seeds. Further, they sow the seeds year-after-year and that too through broadcasting instead of line sowing and hence are not able to maintain recommended plant population in the fields. Farmers also do not use pre-emergence herbicides to control the initial weed growth. This leads to heavy investment on manual labour and also decreases economic yield. Farm mechanization is lagging far behind in pulses cultivation in the country. Most of the farmers are generally resorting to manual operations right from sowing to harvesting. This not only increases cost of cultivation and drudgery but also leads, to more economical losses. Further, many farmers still do not follow recommended practices for pulses cultivation. Instead, they prefer to follow their age-old traditional way and do not adopt diseases and pest management recommendations. Major constraints in increasing pulses production Low realized yield, instability in production, risk due to climate change, sharp decline in area of pulses in Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP), inadequate seed replacement rate, post harvest losses, wide fluctuation in prices, poor availability of critical inputs, poor transfer of technology, poor seed storage facilities and less mechanization are the major impediments.
