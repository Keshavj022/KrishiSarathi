 Repeat spray if required after a fortnight. Thrips (Retithrips syriacus) Both nymphs and adults suck sap resulting in characteristic wrinkling of plants and withe‐ ring of develop‐ ing spikes. Through‐ out crop season Varieties resistant to leaf hopper are also tolerant to thrips damage. Spray monocrotophos (0.05%) or dimethoate (0.05%) if damage symptoms appear. Whitefly (Trialeuro des ricini) Crop presents a sick appearance and sooty mould develops when whitefly infes‐ tation is severe. High infestation during summer on irrigated castor Double and triple bloom genotypes are susceptible. Usually does not warrant any control. Spray monocrotophos (0.05%) or dimethoate (0.05%). Repeat spray if required after a fortnight www.icar.org.in 25 2002 ‐ 2007 F. Important diseases of castor and their management Red spider mite (Tetran‐ ychus telarius L.) Suck sap from leaves. Plants show characteristic yellowing. Serious during summer on irrigated castor (March to May). Spray dicofol (0.05%) Seedling blight (Phytophthora parasitica (Dastur) Waterhouse Dull green roundish patches develop on both the surfaces of cotyledonary leaves, infection spreads to form alternate light and dark brown concentric zones. Cotyledonary leaves rot and hang down. Infection spreads to the base of the petiole, point of attachment and stem. Seedlings wither and dry.  Avoid sowing in low lying areas.  Provide proper field drainage to avoid water-logged conditions.  Treat the seeds with thiram or captan 3g/kg seed.  Give need based spray of copper oxychloride 3g/l to avoid further spread of the disease. Fusarial Wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ricini Nanda & Prasad) Discolouration of hypocotyls, loss of turgidity of top leaves and marginal necrosis at the seedling stage. On adult plants, gradual yellowing and sickly appearance of leaves followed by necrosis, browning of xylem tissues, formation of a dark stripe and pinkish overgrowth on the entire stem up to the infected leaves. Irreversible wilting with bending of apical leaves and branches.  Cultivate disease tolerant/resistant varieties, viz., DCS-9, 48-1 (Jwala), Harita, GCH-4, GCH-5 and DCH-177.  Seed treatment with carbendazim (slurry 2g/Kg or seed soak 1g/l for 12 hrs)/ Tricho-derma viride 10g/kg and soil application 2.5 kg/ha incubated in 125 kg FYM.  Avoid continuous cultivation.  Crop rotation with pearlmillet/ fingermillet or cereals Root rot/Die back (Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid) Plants show signs of water shortage. Dark black lesions develop on the stem near ground level. The taproot shows signs of drying and root bark shreds off easily. In severe infection entire branch or top of the branch withers away. Aerial infection in the form of small brown depressed lesions on or around the nodes. Wilting of leaves start from the apex and proceeds downwards. Pycnidia develop on woody tissue and in the pith region.  Burning and destruction of crop debris.  Crop rotation with cereal crops.
