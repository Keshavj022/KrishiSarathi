 With its tropical climate and proximity to ports, Bengal has the potential to develop into one of the largest producers of processed fish, value added fish and meat products in the country.   Hilsa is mostly available in the eastern part of Bay of Bengal, especially in West Bengal and Bangladesh coastal waters and in the rivers and estuaries of the region. A trend on hilsa catch and import from across the border is given here to understand the dwindling nature of this important fishery vis-a-vis its demand in the market. The visible decline in hilsa catch in the estuarine and riverine stretch of Hooghly-Matla system is a matter of serious concern for the State. Indiscriminate capture of juveniles is further causing damage to already disturbed fishery. 30.2 Strategy and action plan for enhancing production, cost reduction, quality improvement, generating additional income 1. Availability of quality certified seeds/ planting materials Being an agrarian State with relatively high level of cropping intensity and diversified crop production, the production and productivity has a direct correlation to the availability of quality seed which forms the critical production input. It is well documented that improved seed quality alone can increase 20% crop yield. The most important component in increasing crop production and productivity resulting in increase in farmers’ income is ‘quality seed’. At present approximately 50% of seed requirement in the State is being sourced from other parts of the country. The diverse agro climatic conditions in the State offer good scope for seed production of different crops. Production of certified seeds should be sectorized based on best suitable area for production of seed of a particular crop and knowledge of seed producer, instead of trying to produce seeds of all crops throughout the State. There is need of providing supports to the farmers for region specific, short duration varieties of paddy, drought and disease resistant varieties of paddy, location specific varieties of fine quality rice, location specific scented rice varieties, different pulse varieties with early vigor and profuse branching and short duration and high Harvest Index input. There is need of developing some rice varieties resistant to arsenic for some districts like North 24 Parganas, Nadia etc. Production of certified seeds should be de-centralized. Emphasis needs to given on decentralized 642 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 production through “seed village concept” with active involvement of progressive farmers, farmers’ clubs, PACs/ societies. Active involvement of KVKs both in production as well as extending technical support to farmers/ other agencies is needed. The State is emphasizing for self sufficiency in quality seed production. Production of certified seed should be continued in the Government Farms as well as in farmer’s field with proper seed testing, seed processing, and storage facilities.
