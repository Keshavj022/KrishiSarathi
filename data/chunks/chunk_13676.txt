 So, the error term of individual states is not correlated with the predictors, which allows for time-invariant variables to play a role as explanatory variables. Table 7 presents the random-effect model. 3.4. Selection of the Pooled, FE, or RE Model and Diagnostic and Speciﬁcation Tests 3.4.1. Selection of the Pooled, FE, or RE Model In the panel-data-regression framework, there is a wide range of options to choose either the pool-regression results, the fixed-effect-regression results, or the random- effects-regression results. This was systematically as follows: Comparison between FE Model (Individual Effect and Time Effect) and Pooled OLS: F Test The hypothesis to be tested is given as: H0: All the differential intercepts are equal to zero. H1: At least one is non-zero. The above set of hypotheses was tested using a restricted F-test in the context of a multiple-regression-model framework, and the results are shown below in Table 8. On both occasions, the signiﬁcant F test implied that the crop-diversiﬁcation data were not poolable for the states of the country. So, ﬁxed-effect models were selected over the pool-OLS model.
