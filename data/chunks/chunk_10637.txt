 Genome editing for enhanced productivity and stress tolerance Genome editing is a precision mutagenesis tool for genetic improvement of crops. Transgene free genome edited mega rice cultivar MUT1010 with enhanced yield and stress tolerance was developed by editing four different genes. Rice Teosinte Branched1 (TB1) gene, a negative regulator tillering, was edited to crease a loss of function mutant of TB1 gene with 13 bp deletion in rice cv. MTU1010. The transgene free tb1 mutant produced about 35 tillers as compared with 15 tillers in WT MTU1010 plants and yielded 66- 70% higher grain yield per plant. DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE1 (DEP1) codes for G protein γ subunit, involved in the regulation of number of grains per panicle. By using CRISPR-Cas9, a single base pair insertion mutant of dep1 was created in MTU1010. The dep1 mutant produced 52-54% higher grains/plant and 21-15% higher grain yield per plant as compared with WT MTU1010.

Hence this gene function was knocked out by using CRISPR-Cas9 in rice cv. in MTU1010. The ckx2 mutant in MTU1010 produced about 53-64% increase in the grains per panicle as compared with WT plants. The DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE (DST) gene, a Zinc finger transcription factor that negatively regulate salt tolerance, was edited by using CRISPR-Cas9 in MTU1010. Three homozygous Transgene free mutants were developed with both seedling stage and reproductive stage tolerance to salinity stress. Genome edited TEOSINTE BRANCHED1 gene knock out mutant of MTU1010 produces higher number of tillers and grain yield DARE-ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2014-2021 24 D. Genetic modification of crops with new traits For imparting resistance to the devastating insect pod borer in Pigeonpea, transgenic lines expressing two different Bt genes (Cry1AcF and Cry2Aa) were developed and advanced to the Event Selection Trial stage (applied for trial permission). Bioassay using the pod borer insects revealed high level of resistance in the transgenic plants (T) as compared to non- transgenic wild type (WT) plants. Late blight resistant transgenic potato lines expressing RB gene and virus resistant transgenic potato (RNAi against ToLCV) were advanced to BRL-1 trial stage (applied for trial permission) Aphid resistant mustard (expressing lectin gene) were taken to the advanced stage of glasshouse trials. Transgenic banana for fusarium wilt resistance, potato for amelioration of cold induced sweetening and sugarcane for abiotic stress tolerance were advanced to different stages of glasshouse trials.
