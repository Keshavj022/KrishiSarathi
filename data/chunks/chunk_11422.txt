 All parts of the plant are indispensable food adjuncts in Indian cookery. Coriander is a tropical plant and is capable of tolerating heat and drought. Grain yield and quality are at best when moderately cool and dry weather prevails during grain formation stage. It can grow in all types of soil, but well drained loamy soils are suitable for good growth. Coriander is grown throughout the year for leaf purpose but for grain, the crop is sown during October- November. FYM or compost is applied during last ploughing A seed rate of 10- 15 kg/ha is generally adopted for irrigated conditions. Varieties are Pant harithma, V1, V2, GC1, GC2, Sindhu, Swati, CO-2, CO-3., Azad dhaniya-1. FYM 25 tonnes/ ha, 60 kg nitrogen, 40 kg phosphorus and 20 kg potash are recommended. Aphid: If Infestation of Aphid is observed, to control spray of Imidacloprid@6ml/10Ltr water or Thiamethoxam@4gm/10Ltr of water is recommended. Powdery Mildew is Patchy, White powdery growth appears on upper surface of leaves and its control spraying water soluble Sulphur@20gm/10Ltr or Propiconazole10EC (Topas) @200ml/ acre in 200Ltr of water is recommended. Fenugreek It can be grown in all type of soil rich in organic content but give best result when grown in well drained loamy or sandy loam soils. It can tolerate pH of range 5.3 to 8.2. The crop requires a cool climate and is capable of tolerating frost or freezing weather. Dry weather is essential during crop maturity phase. Last week of October and first week of November is best time for sowing. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 165 18-25 Kg seed/ ha. Seeds are soaked in water for 2 days prior to sowing to enhance germination. Seeds are also treated with Rhizobium culture. Varieties are CO-1Fenugreek, Rajendra Kranti, Pusa early bunching, kasuric selections, Azad methi-1, Hissar Sonali. Farmyard manure or compost at the rate of 15-25 tonnes/ ha is applied. The biomass production is high with higher doses of organic matter. Nitrogen @20 kg/ha, phosphorus 60kg/ha and potash 40 kg/ ha should be applied. To attain fast growth 15-20 days after germination spray Triacontanol hormone@20ml/10 lt of water is recommended. Infestation of Aphid, to control spray Imidacloprid@3ml/10Ltr or Thiamethoxam@4gm/10Ltr of water. To protect crop from root rot, as preventive measure soil application of Neem Cake@60kg/acre. Treat seeds with Trichoderma viride@4gm/kg of seed. If observed in field to control, drenched soil with Carbendazim @5gm/Ltr of water or Copper oxychloride@2gm/litre of water. Powdery Mildew is Patchy, White powdery growth appears on upper surface of leaves and its control spraying water soluble Sulphur@20gm/10Ltr or Propiconazole10EC (Topas) @200ml/ acre in 200Ltr of water is recommended. Fennel Fennel also known as Saunf. Its seeds after drying are used for spice purpose. Fennel is good source of fibre, vitamin C, potassium.
