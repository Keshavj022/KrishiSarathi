 Heteroscedastic Check As the Breusch—Pagan test is significant (BP = 834.14 with df =27 & p-value < 2.2 × 10−16), it conﬁrms the presence of heteroscedasticity in the data. So, to reduce heteroscedasticity, the use of a robust covariance matrix is suggested. Serial Correlation Check The problem of serial correlation (autocorrelation) is present in the ﬁxed-effect model (individual effect) as the Breusch—Godfrey/Wooldridge test—ﬁxed-effect (F(1,376) = 45337 (p −value = 2.2 × 10−16)) model is found to be statistically signiﬁcant. Multicollinearity Test The variance inﬂating factor (VIF) in Table 10 indicates that this model does not suffer from the multicollinearity problem. Because the VIF of all coefﬁcients is less than 5, multicollinearity is not a problem in this panel. Table 10. Variance inﬂation factor (VIF) of independent variables.

Sustainability 2022, 14, 16861 14 of 18 Controlling Heteroskedasticity: Fixed Effects To control the heteroskedasticity problem in the estimation, we performed the robust covariance-matrix estimation, i.e., sandwich estimator. The ﬁnal-revised model estimation is obtained after applying Arellano-robust-standard-error estimation, which is suitable for controlling both heteroskedasticity and serial correlation [37] (Table 11).

In the post-green-revolution era, traditional food crops and cereal-based products occupied a part of the Indian agricultural practices, due to the Indian diet and the emphasis on monoculture by the government. Though the farmers were more interested to cultivate staple food crops or traditional crops, such as, paddy, wheat, pulses, it remains the case in the present. Farmers are obligated to grow these crops for food security reasons, despite their low proﬁtability. Secondly, due to higher investment burden and asymmetry of information, farmers are not initially showing an interest in shifting their crop portfolio from traditional practices to high-value crops. Here, farmers’ price policy also plays a crucial role to continue the production of current products.
