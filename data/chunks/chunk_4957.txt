 The results obtained are presented in Table 1 for teak, Table 2 for neem and Table 3 and for mango. The results on moisture distribution showed that in teak the moisture was higher in ITK method as compared to basin method in all the sites and depths of measurement. The same trend existed under neem and mango trees also. The content was maximum at 60 cm depth. Enough moisture was retained in the depressions of the ITK method. Also the moisture was maximum in the sites near to the depression (S1) and least in S3. The biometric observations on growth  RAIN WATER MANAGEMENT Table 1.

Results of biometric observations showed that height of the teak, neem and mango trees tended to increase due to depressions made for rain water infiltration as compared to making basins. However, collar diameter for all the 3 trees remained unchanged with the moisture conservation methods.  rainwater management Table 4.
