 Earthworm types One kilogram of matured earthworm sp. Eudrilus eugeniae (African Night Crawler) was distributed to the farmers for vermicomposting process. The increased population of the earthworms in their vermicompost unit were further used either for next compost production or partly marketed to the local new compost producers. Improved composting process with KVK technical support Generally, the common practice included the use of only cow dung, direct incorporation of earthworms to the cow dung excluding the preparation of the partly decomposed cow dung as earthwormâ€™s feed. This approach not only trimmed down the composting Table 1. Knowledge gaps regarding the traditional composting process by the farmers Common practice Lacking of information Improvement of the knowledge after KVK interventions Long term heaping of cow dung In absence of turning of the staked cow dung, partial decomposed compost was produced due to incomplete composting Adapting regular turning and mixing of the cow dung heap to release the temperature, smell and gases and for better aeration Using of only cow dung for composting Absence of knowledge of using different agricultural green waste Incorporation of agricultural green waste for composting Using unsuitable earthworms for composting Absence of awareness about the efficiency of proper variety of earthworms Uses proper earthworm variety i.e. Eudrilus eugeniae Poor maintenance of the composting materials during composting process Insufficient knowledge regarding the requirement of optimal conditions (feed quality, temperature, moisture content, aeration and bedding materials) for better growth of earthworms Preparing the good quality of earthworm feed by utilizing different wastes, pre decomposing the cow dung Maintaining the moisture content, temperature and aeration for better growth and activity of earthworms by shading the pit, covering by gunny bag, sprinkling, scraping the composting materials respectively Improper techniques for earthworm collection The common practice includes the collection of earthworms by sieving of the prepared compost that increases the mortality risk and egg loss Adapting the earthworm harvest techniques includes incubation and feed supplementing based collection process Horizontal dissipation of the vermicomposting technology at villages of Bhangar I and Canning II Blocks, South 24 Parganas, West Bengal Indian Farming 5 May 2023 efficiency but also reduced the earthworm population and their reproduction rate. Moreover, it was observed that huge green biomass of aquatic plant (water hyacinth, water cabbage) and pseudo stem of banana were wasted in villages of these areas. Mushroom cultivation was one of the household level agri- entrepreneurship in these villages which produced large amount of mushroom straw waste.
