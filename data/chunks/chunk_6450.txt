b, the Indian isolates grouped with contemporary isolates circulating in Eurasia, Africa and North America indicating recent introduction of the virus. However, the H5N1 viruses from clade 2.3.2.1a isolated during 2023 grouped with contemporary H5N1 viruses isolated from SAARC regions including India, indicating cross-border movement and persistence of the H5N1 virus, which highlights the need for continuous active surveillance. Complete genome analysis of African swine fever viruses isolated from domestic pigs in Mizoram, India: Complete genome analysis of an African Swine Fever virus (ASFV) (IND/NIHSAD/SD/21_49), isolated from domestic pigs during the first outbreak in Mizoram in 2021 showed nucleotide identity of 99.99% with two previously reported Indian ASFV isolates (IND/AS/SD-02/2020 and IND/AR/SD-61/2020). Sequence analysis revealed that the Mizoram isolate (MZ-314/IND/2021) exhibited eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at different genomic coordinates compared to other Indian isolates, specifically IND/AS/ SD-02/2020 and IND/AR/SD-61/2020. Two SNPs were observed in both the 3’ ITR and intergenic regions, and one SNP each was identified in different genes, namely, K205R, EP1242L, B263R, and E199L, when compared LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 95 8. Fisheries Management Marine Fish Stock Status of India: ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (ICAR-CMFRI) provides valuable insights into the health of India’s marine fisheries and is the first endeavour of its kind in the Asian Region using biology-based data. Overall, 135 marine finfish and shellfish stocks were assessed using marine fish landings and species-specific biology data from 1,168 landing centers from the Northwest, Southwest, Northeast, Southeast and Lakshadweep regions. The study reveals that of the 135 fish stocks assessed (Northeast – 16, Northwest – 37, Southeast – 39, Southwest – 41, Lakshadweep – 2) in 2022, 91.1% of them were healthy. The highest percentage of healthy stocks was observed in Lakshadweep followed by Southeast region (97.4%), Southwest (92.7%), Northeast (87.5%) and Northwest (83.8%). The report also identifies management measures that could be applied to the fish stocks/ species that are of concern with regional approaches that will ensure their sustainability. This report will set the stage for a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) framework for marine fisheries in the country. It will also form a valuable resource for fishery managers, policymakers, researchers and other stakeholders who are working to ensure the sustainability of India’s marine fisheries.
