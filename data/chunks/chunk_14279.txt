S. Saha and P. Mondal Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 179–191 187 (High) accounts for 20.52 per cent (21503.99 ha), and Zone V (Very High) accounts for 12.53 per cent (13133.67 ha). The final potential suitability map using FCOPRAS weight has been generated in the GIS environment and classified (Fig. 4b) into five suitable Zones: Zone I (Very Low) with 17.51 per cent (18344.56 ha), Zone II (Low) with 24.77 per cent (25961.01 ha), Zone III (moderate) with 19.79 per cent (20733.26 ha), Zone IV (High) with 22.54 per cent (23620.65 ha), and Zone V (Very high) with 15.39 per cent (16130.52 ha) of the total area, respectively (Table 6). 4.2.2. ML algorithms/techniques The calibration of current RF model is involved hyperparameter adjustment to find the best balance of the factors of n estimators, number of decision tree levels, number of features that can be used to split a node, and sampling method (with or without replacement. Bagging with 100 iterations of ten-fold cross validation was performed to facilitate model optimization and generalizability while avoiding over fitting on the test dataset. The final potential suitability map using the Random Forest algo­ rithm has been generated in Weka 3.8.5 and the GIS environment and classified (Fig. 4c) into five suitable classes as Zone I (Very Low) with 18.46 per cent (19343.35 ha), Zone II (Low) with 20.94 per cent (21948.15 ha), Zone III (moderate) with 23.63 per cent (24762.12 ha), Zone IV (High) with 22.30 per cent (23367.9 ha), and Zone V (Very high) with 14.67 per cent (15368.46 ha) of the total area, respectively. The final potential suitability map using the Multilayer Perceptron algorithm has been generated in Weka 3.8.5 (WEKA platform was developed by the University of Waikato, New Zealand) and the GIS environment and classified (Fig. 4d) into five suitable classes as Zone I (Very Low) with 10.53 per cent (11031.33 ha), Zone II (Low) with 26.02 per cent (27262.28 ha), Zone III (moderate) with 35.99percent (37718.49 ha), Zone IV (High) with 22.01 per cent (23059.92 ha), and Zone V (Very high) with 5.46 per cent (5717.977 ha) of the total area, respectively (Table 6). 5. Effectiveness estimation of the applied models/methods/ algorithms 5.1. Area changing matrix and proficiency estimation using ROC In the current research, 70 (70%) locations are employed for soil potentiality mapping, and 30 (30%) of the entire data set is used to justify the potentiality analysis. The AUC for the AHP model is 0.923, whereas the FCOPRAS model has an AUC of 0.938. On the other hand, the AUC for the Random Forest is 0.947, and for the Multilayer Per­ ceptron, it is 0.932.
