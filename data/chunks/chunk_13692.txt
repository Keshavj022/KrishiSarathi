Soil & Tillage Research 223 (2022) 105443 6 In surface layer (0–15 cm), soils under RW had highest microaggregate-associated C concentration (Table 5). However, soils under NF and NG had similar microaggregate-associated C in the 0–15 cm layer. In the 15–30 cm layer, soil microaggregate-associated C under MW was 38% and 127% more than RW and NF land uses, respectively. In the surface soil layer (0–15 cm), not much variations in C con­ centrations within silt and clay size fractions were observed among the land uses. Only, soils under AH had significantly less C within silt plus clay than all other land uses (Table 5). Soils under RW and RV had 146% and 205% more C within silt plus clay than AH land use. In the 15–30 cm layer, soils under NG showed highest and NF showed least C concen­ tration within silt plus clay fraction. In this layer, soils under RV had 99% more C concentration within silt plus clay than AH land use. Similarly, soils under RW had 97% more C within silt plus clay than NF. 4. Discussion 4.1. Effect of land uses on total soil organic carbon and carbon stocks Overall, total soil organic carbon (SOC) and stocks were higher in soils under native forest (NF) than the agroforestry and cropping sys­ tems. Although various organic matter (OM) input were added in cropped soils, it takes a prolonged period to actually build-up of OM in soil. In NF soils, the main source of the OM addition is the leaf-litter fall which stays in soil until decomposition (Cardinael et al., 2012). In addition, the below-ground fine root turnover also contributes to SOC. No soil disturbance was another reason why NF had higher SOC in surface and subsurface soil layers.
