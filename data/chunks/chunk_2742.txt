 Various procedures followed to analyse the plants be- longing to To through T) generations have been listed in Table 1. T1 generation progeny (265) of the twelve PCR· positive plants were raised in the transgenic greenhouse and subjected to various analyses. About 22 seeds from each To plant were planted. PCR and Xpress strip testS re- vealed gene segregation in T I generation; only 46 plants out of 256 showed positive results in PCR (crylAc prim- ers) and XPrP"iS strip test. Southem hybridization was performed with samples taken from eight out of 46 PCR- positive plants, which belonged to different To lines. The results showed that there were clear hybridization signals in only two samples (nos 4 and 6) and the copy number varied from one to two in the transfonned plants (Figure 2). Although the other six plants were po!>itive in PCR i:lnd immunological tests, no hybridization Signals were de- teeted in the Southern analysis.

T1 plants (13,136) were grown in the field and various analyses were conducted. Plants in the T2 genera- tion (rapidly expanding leaves at SO days after planting) showed high levels of Cry1Ac protein expression as measured by Quan-T ELISA (1.59 to 2.46 f'glg FW). In comparison, the levels of CrylAc protein in Mech 162 Bt ranged rrom 1.04 to 1.82 f'g/g FW. T) progeny of the T2 plant (T1-11) was used for insect bioassay.
