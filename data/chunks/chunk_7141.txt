26 ha/h and 65%, respectively, at a forward speed of 0.55 m/s. Laboratory model robotic transplanter for plug- type vegetable seedlings A laboratory model of robotic transplanter was developed for plug-type vegetable seedlings. The seedling pick-up mechanism is integrated with the manipulator with computer programming using Microchip-16F877. The transplanter is under testing and evaluation. Tractor operated garlic weeder A tractor operated 19 row garlic weeder was developed. Effective field capacity and field efficiency of the weeder are 0.29 ha/h and 81.2%, respectively, at 2 km/h forward speed of operation. Average weeding efficiency and plant damage by garlic weeder are 69.6% and 0.1%, respectively. Garlic harvester for raised beds A tractor operated garlic harvester was developed for harvesting of garlic crop grown on raised beds (up to 150 mm height and 1,200 mm top width). The garlic harvester was evaluated in the garlic crop sown at 100 mm row to row and plant to plant spacing at 1.93 km/h forward speed and working depth of 60â€“80 mm. Effective field capacity of the machine is 0.21 ha/h at field efficiency of ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 97 MECHANIZATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 98 Deep learning algorithm development for identifi- cation of water stress conditions in field crops A study was envisaged to explore the potential of deep convolution neural networks (DCNN) models based on deep learning (DL) techniques for identification of stress and non-stress conditions in maize and wheat crops. The RGB images (>3,000 for each crop) of stressed and non- stressed crops of wheat and maize were captured using digital camera. The training accuracy in identification of water stress was 50.54, 68.82 and 64.52% for wheat and 55.32, 98.30 and 92.86% for maize using AlexaNet, GoogLeNet and Inception V3, respectively. The GoogleNet outperformed the AlexNet and Inception V3 in classification of water stress with an accuracy of 68.82 and 98.30% for wheat and maize crops, respectively. RGB-thermal imager for water stress assessment in field crops Thermal imagers are useful tool for crop stress monitoring and real time application of irrigation scheduling. It can be used for measuring surface temperature of fruits, seeds, vegetables, heating problems in machines and detection of human body surface temperature. The commercially available thermal imagers have limitations for their application in spatial data collection along with location coordinates and real time data processing. In addition, they are costly and can not be integrated with actuation system for real time communication. To overcome these issues, a RGB- thermal imager was developed. The RGB, thermal and GPS modules were attached directly with micro- controller board. The Raspberry pi board was driven by NOOBS operating system having 64 GB memory.
