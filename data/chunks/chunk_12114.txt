 of candidates applied/appeared for AICE-JRF/SRF(PGS)-2019 and eligible for counselling vis-a-vis the number of seats Landscape of Higher Agricultural Education in India 42 Through the AICE-JRF/SRF (PGS)-2019 examination, 100% seats were filled up for the subjects like Natural Resource Management-I and Agricultural Statistics, while for Horticulture and Agricultural Engineering and Technology above 90% seats were filled up. For the subjects Veterinary and Animal Sciences-I, Veterinary and Animal Sciences-III, Dairy Science, Dairy Technology & Food Technology, there were only very few takers as almost half of the seats remained unfilled (Table-17). The highest number of female candidates (34 out of 66, 51.51%) got admission in Veterinary and Animal Sciences-II, followed by Natural Resource Management-II (43 out of 91, 47.25%) and Crop Sciences-II (33 out of 75, 44.00%) reflecting a greater interest exhibited by girl candidates for pursuing doctorate degree in Veterinary and Animal Science subjects like Veterinary Parasitology, Veterinary Public Health/Veterinary Public Health & Epidemiology, Veterinary Biochemistry, Animal Biotechnology, Veterinary Microbiology and Veterinary Pathology. Based upon their merit in AICE-JRF/SRF (PGS)-2019, the ICAR JRF/SRF(PGS) Fellowship was awarded to 297 candidates (99%) for pursuing doctoral studies for a period of three years who got admission in universities other than those of UG/PG or UG+PG degrees. A massive increase to the tune of 333 % was observed in the number of female awardees receiving JRF/SRF (PGS) in 2019 vis-Ã -vis the examination conducted during the year 2014 for the award of SRF (PGS). Barring 2017-18, there has been a progressive increase in the number of female applicants receiving JRF/SRF (PGS) since 2014-15. It is encouraging to observe that the gender gap, insofar as award with or without JRF/SRF (PGS) is concerned, has reduced dramatically over the years and during 2019-20 the female candidates competed almost equally with male candidates to receive JRF/SRF (PGS). Gender-wise distribution of the candidates qualified with or without JRF/SRF (PGS) is illustrated in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, respectively. The category-wise distribution of the candidates qualified with or without JRF/ SRF (PGS) is illustrated in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, respectively. A total of 297 JRF/SRF (PGS) were awarded during 2019-20 to the eligible candidates, while a total of 369 candidates were recommended for admission without fellowship. Temporal distribution of awardees with/without JRF/SRF (PGS) is depicted in Fig. 14. Based on the JRF/SRF (PGS) secured by the postgraduates of various universities, the three top ranking universities in 2019 were GBPUAT, Pantnagar; IVRI, Izatnagar, Bareilly; and PAU, Ludhiana (Table 24).
