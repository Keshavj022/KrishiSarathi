 Cost-effective water quality kits for estimation of DO, pH, ammonia, calcium, magnesium and hardness critical water parameters. 10. Promotion of functional feeds for larvae and broodstock as alternates for imported expensive hatchery feeds. The specific action plans suggested for enhancement of the farmers’ (stake holders) income in fisheries are 1. Approaches like “production and productivity enhancement, price enhancement, value addition / rich, and market strengthening”. 2. Enlargement of culture area and efficient water usage 3. Technology intervention and to effect the migration from conventional farming to input based farming so as to produce high value fishes 4. Reduction of post-harvest loss and quality assurance for high price command 5. Integrated use of resources for holistic production approach involving all sectors and both genders without any discrimination 6. Promotion measures by the government for the wide scale adoption and assured income through creation of aquaculture park in coastal regions and specially designated areas. Marketing support through supply of transport carriers and live fish market facilities 7. Technical support from research (University and ICAR and Central Institutes) In order to overcome the limitations, the Government is taking the following measures:   Adopting Eco friendly and sustainable fish / shrimp aquaculture   Introduction of fish seed rearing in floating cages in water bodies   Adopting intensive cage farming in reservoirs   Creation of fish seed banks to ensure the availability of fish seeds throughout the year   Undertaking intensive fish culture in irrigation tanks 526 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022   Integrating fish culture in farm ponds / multipurpose farm ponds with agriculture to provide additional income for Farmers.   Introduction of culture technology for fast growing fishes viz., Amur Carp, Jayanthi Rohu, Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT) and Pangassius, dissemination of knowledge for its propagation and establishing hatcheries for these species.   Encouraging farmers by providing subsidy for setting up of infrastructural facilities for fish/prawn hatchery, fish culture in grow out ponds, feed mill and hygienic marketing infrastructure.   To enhance the fishing efficiency of Inland fishermen.   Creating job opportunities by promoting ornamental fish culture to rural women and youngsters. Government is taking efforts on all spheres, to effectively boost the Inland fish production of the State by implementing various schemes under NADP. During 2016-17, fish culture with fast growing fish species has been taken up in 383 irrigation tanks covering an area of 9,000 hectares and this will be extended to 500 more irrigation tanks covering an area of 15,000 ha. during 2017-18. The Government has mooted initiatives to double the income of agriculture farmers of the state by providing subsidy assistance to the tune of Rs.3.
