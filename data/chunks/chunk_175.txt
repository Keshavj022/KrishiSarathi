 Dharani groundnut variety performed better and about 15.8% increase in yield (1,796 kg/ha) was recorded over Kadiri-6 (1,551 kg/ha). It was due to more number of pods, uniform pod maturity and high shelling percentage and drought resistance during dry spells, tolerance to bud necrosis . The technology disseminated to an area of around 1,000 ha in the mandal and nearby mandals. Triple disease resistant tomato hybrid, Arka Samrat Traditionally farmers in NICRA cluster villages cultivate private hybrids in tomato crop which are susceptible to diseases like tomato leaf curl virus, bacterial wilt and early blight causing considerable yield loss. Farmers are used to managing diseases by spraying combination of fungicides 8-10 times during cropping period by spending huge amount. Hence RASS KVK demonstrated triple disease resistant tomato hybrid, Arka Smarat during the years 2017-18 and 2018-19. It is resistant to tomato leaf curl, bacterial wilt and early blight with a yield potential of 80-85 t/ha in 140 days. Arka Samrat recorded about 11.6% increase in yield (58,520 kg/ha) when compared to Sweekar 448 (52,200 kg/ha). Cost of tomato production was more in Sweekar 448 due to more amount (%6,000 per ha) incurred by the farmers for disease control. Disease incidence was not observed in Arka Samrat, whereas about 1-25% incidence was observed in Sweekar 448. Resource conservation technology in paddy — Direct seeding using drum seeder Manual transplanting is the most common method Indian Farming ¥ cole-4pi tena floio, adie F * terete a) coy yous. . Demonstration of Arka Samrat tomato hybrid. of crop establishment in paddy in the cluster villages. It involves nursery bed preparation, nursery growing, care of seedlings, uprooting of seedlings and transport to main field. All these operations requires more number of labour and hence increases the cost of cultivation and also often results in delay in transplanting because of shortage of labour. Increasing water scarcity is also becoming real threat for paddy cultivation. Direct seeding using drum seeder avoids raising of nursery, pulling of seedlings and transportation of the same to main field so that labour requirement for crop establishment is negligible. This method also requires less water as it avoids nursery and reduces crop duration. RASS KVK conducted demonstrations in NICRA cluster villages on direct seeding in rice using drum seeder during 2015 to 2018 during rabi season using the variety RNR-15048, which is a fine grain variety of 125 days duration and blast tolerant. On an average, direct seeded paddy using drum seeder recorded 11.5% higher grain yield (6,442 kg/ha), 18.4% low cost of cultivation (47,586 per ha) and 64% higher net returns (%50,817 per ha) as compared to manual transplanting method. Majority of the farmers in the district are practicing this technology as it overcomes labour shortage, reduces cost of cultivation, water requirement in addition to yield enhancement.
