 Adoption of natural farming ICAR is spearheading a nationwide initiative titled ‘Out-scaling Natural Farming through Krishi Vigyan Kendras’ across 425 districts in India. Natural farming is practiced in several states, with prominent adoption observed in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. Currently, approximately 6.5 lakh hectares of land are covered under natural farming in India. This approach aims to reduce dependency on purchased inputs, offering a cost-effective farming solution with potential for enhancing employment and rural development. Total 48 KVKs were allotted for implementing the natural farming during the 2022-23, 16 KVKs were allotted Indian Farming 06 March 2024 Indian Farming 57 March 2024 from Chhattisgarh state while 32 KVKs from Madhya Pradesh. Natural farming prioritizes the restoration of soil health, maintenance of biodiversity, ensuring animal welfare, efficient utilization of natural and local resources, and promoting ecological fairness. Key practices essential for the adoption of natural farming includes avoidance of external inputs, utilization of local seeds, emphasizing the use of indigenous varieties, application of on-farm produced microbial formulations (such as bijamrita) for seed treatment, incorporation of on-farm made microbial inoculants (such as jivamrita) to enrich the soil, implementation of cover crops and mulching using green and dry organic matter to recycle nutrients and create a conducive microclimate for beneficial microbial activity in the soil, adoption of mixed cropping practices, promotion of farm diversity through the integration of trees, pest management through utilization of local on-farm made botanical concoctions (like neemastra, agniastra, neem ark, dashparni ark, etc.), integration of livestock (particularly native breeds) for the utilization of cow dung and cow urine as essential inputs for various practices and emphasis on water and moisture conservation techniques.
