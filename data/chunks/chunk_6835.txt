 It reduces pesticide use and pollution while increasing efficiency and bio-efficacy. The developed air-assisted nozzle has a flow rate of 120 ml/min and high voltage DC to DC charging system to charge the electrode up to 10 kV. The spray lance can operate up to a distance of 10 m. The performance of electrostatic sprayer was optimized at 1.0 km/h forward speed for 0.55 m height of application. It has 85% bio-efficacy on cotton aphids and 92% bio- efficacy on jassids for LN90 dosages of 0.15 ml/litre. The developed system can save 75% fuel, 30% pesticide and costs 20% less per ha. The cost of developed electrostatic sprayer was ₹70,000. The operating cost, breakeven point (BEP) and payback period of the sprayer were ₹2.56/ha, 78 h/year and 365 h, respectively. Mechanization package for garlic cultivation on broad beds A tractor-operated eight-row garlic clove dibbler was developed for precise dibbling on broad beds. The machine can dibble garlic cloves at seed- to-seed and row-to- row spacing of 100 mm and 150 mm, respectively. It was evaluated in the field for dibbling of garlic cloves in eight rows on broad beds. The depth of sowing was maintained at 40 mm during the operation. The field capacity and field efficiency of the planter were 0.22 ha/h and 73.6%, respectively at 2 km/h forward speed of operation. The missing and multiple of the machine were 3.5 and 8.5%, respectively. A tractor-drawn garlic weeder has been developed for weeding in garlic crop sown on broad beds. The row- to-row spacing of the developed unit can be adjusted from 100 to 150 mm. The effective field capacity and weeding efficiency of the weeder are 0.13 ha/h and 63%, respectively at forward speed of 1.1 km/h and 20–25% soil moisture content. A tractor-operated garlic harvester was developed for harvesting of garlic crop on raised beds. It has been evaluated in the garlic crop sown at 100 mm row-to-row and plant-to-plant spacing. The machine was operated at forward speed and working depth of 1.9 km/h and 60–80 mm, respectively during the operation. The effective field capacity of machine was 0.21 with efficiency of 72%. The harvesting efficiency and bulb damage during the operation were 97 and <0.5%, respectively. The development of garlic dibbler, weeder and harvester along with the adoption of existing tillage and spraying equipment practised by farmers provides a complete package of mechanization for garlic cultivation on broad beds. This mechanization package can save 34–40% Small Scale Portable Bio-char Kiln for Biochar Production A small-scale portable biochar kiln for biochar production from agricultural residue was developed. The input capacity of developed biochar kiln for wheat husk, maize stalk, maize cob and rice husk is 5, 4, 15 and 7 kg, respectively. The conversion efficiency was 42% for wheat husk, 41% for maize cob, 34% for maize stalk and 35% for rice husk residues.
