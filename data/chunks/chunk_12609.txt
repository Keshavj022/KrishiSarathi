It should also improve income from allied activities to agriculture. The strategy should integrate these all. The following options are available for increasing farmers’ income. 1.1. Improving productivity and quality   Providing quality seed and enhancing seed replacement ratio   Promoting high-yielding varieties and hybrids   Growing nutrient rich rice (CR Dhan 310 and 311) and aromatic rice   Increasing cropping intensity in rice-fallow areas 1.2. Increasing input use efficiency   Crop planning to identify areas where the crop can be grown with least input   Promoting water harvesting and micro-irrigation to achieve per drop-more crop   Using soil health card and site-specific crop management   Promoting farm mechanization and solar energy 1.3. Reducing crop loss   Adopting plant protection measures   Promoting resistant varieties and e-surveillance   Crop insurance to mitigate risks at affordable cost   Weather services and forecasting system 1.4. Diversification   Dairy husbandry for small farmers   Promotion of intensive vegetable production   Promotion of inland fisheries   Promotion of ancillary activities like poultry, beekeeping and mushroom cultivation   Strengthening Organic Food Program 1.5. Market price realization and value addition   Community/co-operative farming with crop-value chain   Use of the crop biomass to make products through small industry   Creation of a national farm market with information system for export and online selling   Agribusiness Incubation Centres to promote agri-preneurship 400 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Agro-Climatic Zone 1: North Western Plateau Districts: Sundargarh, Deogarh, parts of Sambalpur & Jharsuguda Farming situation Major exist- ing practices (2016-17) Constraints Technological interventions Increase in income by 2022 (%) 1st year (2017-18) 2nd year (2018-19) 3rd year (2019-20) 4th year (2020-21) 5th year (2021-22) Rainfed upland Rice Khandagiri Annapurna - Fallow 22 q ha-1 Rs 11,000/- • Less remunera- tive • Monocrop with broadcasting of seed 1) In-situ and ex- situ rain water harvesting (Field bunding/ check dam/ tank cum well system) 2) Crop diversifica- tion with Arhar var.
