Table 2. Important zinc fertilizer application methods in rice Method and rate of zinc application Amount of zinc fertilizer Remarks Soil application of Zinc 2.5 kg/ha Zinc sulphate heptahydrate (ZnSO4.7H2O) at 12.5 kg/ha Suitable for zinc deficient soil with high pH such as sodic soil Soil application of Zinc at 2.5 kg/ha + Foliar application with 0.1% zinc Soil application as above + Foliar spray of 0.5% ZnSO4.7H2O (2500 g in 500 litre water) at 25 DAT In addition to soil application, foliar spray is useful for problematic soil in which zinc uptake is a constraint Soil application of Zinc at 5 kg/ha ZnSO4.7H2O at 25 kg/ha Suitable for highly zinc deficient soil with high pH. The method results in higher residual zinc Soil application of Zinc at 5 kg/ha + Foliar application with 0.1% zinc ZnSO4.7H2O at 25 kg/ha + Foliar spray of 0.5% ZnSO4.7H2O For highly zinc deficient soil and problematic soils One Foliar spray with 0.1% Zn at 25 DAT Foliar spray of 0.5% ZnSO4.7H2O For soils with good amount of native zinc, but availability was suppressed temporarily due to high available phosphorous Two Foliar spray with 0.1% Zn at 25 and 50 DAT Foliar spray of 0.5% ZnSO4.7H2O For soils with the problem of zinc solubility and supply. The method is less expensive. However, each season application is required Seedling root dip with 2% Zn 2.5% ZnO suspension (500 g ZnO in 20 litres water/ha) and seedling roots were dipped for 30 minutes The method is less expensive. Useful to overcome zinc deficiency for initial 2 to 3 weeks Seed dressing with Zinc 2.8 g zinc/kg paddy seed using zinc sulphate or chelated source As above Source: Swati Sucharita (2022). Indian Farming 10 May 2023 It’s a cheaper solution to manage Zn deficiency like seedling root dip. SUMMARY At present rice is largely grown in lowlands under transplanted condition with high input of primary nutrients and ponded water. Due to water shortage, aerobic rice is gaining momentum. Both the lowlands and uplands favour zinc deficiency, especially under continuous intensive rice based system. High soil pH aggravates the problem. Even with hidden hunger, yield reduction up to 20% occurs besides reduction in zinc content in grain. Regular consumption of low zinc rice, in absence of zinc supplementation induces improper development in human beings, especially in children.
