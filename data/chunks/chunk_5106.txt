Eight wounds had maggots and 6 wounds had nomaggots. The mean scores of different parameters are presented in Table 2. The paste of peach leaves was found to be very effective in the treatment of wounds affected by maggots. One or two applications were required to kill or expel of the maggots. The paste was applied on the affected part and bandaged. The wounds without maggots also showed improvement in healing. After 2_3 applications the type and quantity of exudates decreased. The wounds appeared dried and the peripheral swelling subsided. There was concomitant decrease in pain and warmth scores. As the healing progressed, the colour of wounds changed from pale red to pink. All the wounds were healed by day 14 to day 21. CONCLUSION The peach leaves were found to be effective for the treatment of maggoted wounds as well as not affected with maggots REFERENCES Kumar, R. and Tyagi, R. P. S. 1972.
