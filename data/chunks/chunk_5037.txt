CONCLUSION The findings led to conclusion that potam is superior to all the methods/ structures tried for storage of vegetable seeds. GRAIN/SEED STORAGE Code : 1313 Title of the ITK : Protection of sugar and sugar products from ants Description of the ITK : Cloves might be having repelling quality. A few cloves are placed with the sugar or sugar products. This repels ants and all ants get away from the sugar or sugar products. This is practised by the villagers of Samaspur in Etah district of Uttar Pradesh. Name and address of the discloser : Shri Prem Pal Singh C/o Shri Dal Chand House No. 38, Purva Ahiran, Indira Chowk, Meerut (Uttar Pradesh) Location of use of the ITK : The ITK is being practiced in Etah district as reported from Samaspur village of the district.

The area is located in semi-arid zone. The climate is extremely hot in summer and extremely cold in winter. PRA and field study To determine the reliability of this ITK, matrix ranking of PRA method was used. Thirty key informants were selected for ranking on five treatments and five criteria with the help of putting scores out of 10 in each column. The five treatments were: control, sugar with cloves in open container, sugar with cloves in loose container, cloves placed in sugar where ants are present in open container and cloves placed in sugar where ants are present in loose container.
