 The syngas energy potential can be estimated using the following equations- Esg(m, n) = S(m, n) × HHV(SGY(m)) (17) Esgstate(n) = 43 ∑ m=1 Esg(m, n) (18) Esgnational(m) = 36 ∑ n=1 Esgstate(m, n) (19) EsgIndia= 36 ∑ n=1 Esgstate(n) = 43 ∑ m=1 Esgnational(m) (20) Where, Esg (m,n) is the syngas energy production potential for m crop residue in nth state/UT, Esgstate (n) is the state/UT level syngas production potential for 43 crop residues in nth state/UT, Esgnational is the national syngas production potential of m crop residue, EsgIndia is the total syngas production potential of India, from 43 crop residues generated in 36 regions (states/UTs). 2.5. Estimation of methanol production potential In view of upgrading the produced syngas from gasification, it can be converted into biomethanol. The moderate-temperature (250–300 ◦C), high-pressure (50–150 bar) exothermic methanol synthesis reactions, as shown in Eqs. (21) and (22), are used for catalytic methanol production. In the past, ZnO/Cr2O3 catalysts were mostly employed; however, Cu catalysts have lately found their use for most of the commercial synthesis of methanol from 3777 T.J. Deka, A.I. Osman, D.C.

CO + 2H2 ↔CH3OH ∆H25 ◦C = −90.64 kJ/mol (21) CO2 + 3H2 ↔CH3OH + H2O ∆H25 ◦C = −49.67 kJ/mol (22) The conversion efficiency of methanol production from syngas is found to be 25% which is quite low. The common by-products of the methanol synthesis process are- methyl formate, CH4, acetone, and other higher alcohols. Here in this study, to estimate the potential production of methanol from the surplus residue syngas produced, we have taken the conversion factor of syngas to methanol as 0.25 (Yang and Ge, 2016). The basic equation for all the potential estimations of methanol production is as follows- MPz = 0.25 × SGPz (23) Where MPz is the methanol potential for z basis and SGPz is the respective syngas potential concerning Eqs. (14)–(16), z is the basis variable (state/national/India). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Estimation of crop residue potential 3.1.1. Estimation of national-level potential As mentioned above, the gross residue potential for a crop residue was estimated using Eqs. (1)–(4). The estimated gross crop residue potential of India annually from the selected 43 crop residues generated from 28 different crops is found to be 869.11 MT (million tonnes), out of which cereals contribute the highest amounts (478.74 MT) followed by others category (178.11 MT) and horticulture (126.67 MT), respectively. The oilseed gross residue potential is 52.36 MT, and the pulses produced an es- timated gross residue potential of 33.23 MT, which turned out to be the lowest. Of all the individual crops, the highest gross crop residue amount of 191.69 MT is produced by rice (cereal).
