 This decline, coupled with persistent issues of food security and malnutrition, particularly in tribal areas, presents an ongoing challenge. Addressing the dual crisis of biodiversity loss and nutritional security requires tapping into the traditional wisdom of local communities and promoting indigenous crops. The inclusion of millets in the food system becomes crucial for a holistic nutritional approach amid the challenges posed by climate change. In line with the International Year of Millets, aiming to generate domestic and global demand while reintegrating millets into the common diet, the Krishi Vigyan Kendra Ranchi, under the auspices of ICAT-ATARI Patna, has organized a series of recipe contests among rural and farm women in Ranchi district. Participating in millet-based recipe contests, for the village women, presents a unique opportunity to celebrate their rich agricultural heritage and incorporate locally grown millets into their daily lives. These contests not only showcase the diverse culinary traditions of the region but also empower villagers to embrace sustainable and nutritious food choices. By participating in these contests, farm women can share their traditional knowledge of millets, fostering a sense of community and cultural pride. This initiative aims to explore the rich biodiversity of millets and enhance practices related to growing and consuming millets among the local population. In a state where agriculture plays a crucial role in the livelihoods of many, promoting millet cultivation and consumption through millet-based contests can contribute to the economic well-being of local farmers.

India food security is mainly dependent on current staple foods rice and wheat, which are not sufficient to overcome the challenges. The recent publication by the Lancet Commissions recognize the importance of identifying healthy and environmentally sustainable diet like millet which are known for their resilience to climate change and their rich nutritional content. Interestingly, the paper highlights that out of the 14,000 Indian Farming 74 (03): 44-47; March 2024 edible plants available; only three crops viz. rice, maize, and wheat contribute to 60% of our calorie intake. On the other hand, the SDGs 2030 aim to eliminate all forms of malnutrition by 2030. To achieve this ambitious goal, it is crucial to intervene and replace a significant portion of our current diet, which heavily relies on rice, wheat, and maize, with highly nutritious grains like millets. Millets have a significant connection to Jharkhand, both historically and in the present context. It has been a traditional food crop in Jharkhand for generations.
