 The study found that CT+HW-CT+HW had the lowest level of Simpson’s index (0.17); however, ZTR+H-ZTR+H and ZT+HW-ZT +HW had lower Simpson’s diversity indices. In context to these di- versity indexes, Simpson’s reciprocal index was lowest in ZT+HW- ZT+HW. In winter wheat crop, CT+H-ZR+H had higher species richness followed by CT+H-CT+H. Values of Shannon Wiener index (H’) ran- ged from 4.73 for ZT+IWM-ZTR+IWM to 0.92 for CT+H-CT+H. After ZT+IWM-ZTR+IWM, CT+IWM-CT+IWM showed the highest even- ness/equitability. Shannon’s Lowest values of Simpson’s index were observed in CT+H-ZT+H and ZTR+IWM-ZTR+IWM. However, a low Simpson’s diversity index was recorded for CT+H-CT+H. Simpson’s reciprocal index value ranged from 5.58 for CT+HW-CT +HW to 1.81 for CT+H-CT+H. 4. Discussion Among all the weeds, the frequency of grassy and broadleaved weeds was more than sedges during summer season, whereas, more number of grassy weeds were observed during winter season compared to broadleaved weeds. Among different tillage and weed management treatments, likewise, broadleaved weeds and grassy weeds contributed around 48% and 41% of the total weed ﬂora, re- spectively, in the summer season. Similarly, in winter season, broadleaved and grassy weed contributed about 41% and 59% pro- portion of weeds in various treatments. Armengot et al. (2016) re- ported that the total weed population was highest in reduced tillage, although it was not consistent for different crops. From the results of this study, Conservation agriculture (ZTR-ZTR) with zero tillage, crop rotation and soil covering with residue showed the potential to reduce the weed density during summer season compared to intensive tillage (CT-CT) (Table 2). Jat et al. (2021) also conﬁrmed that CA comprising of crop diversiﬁcation, zero ZT and crop residue incorporation/retention inﬂuence the diverse weed population compared to CT. Crop residue application might be a persuasive reason for the reduction in weed density due to physi- cal barrier for emerging seeds which restrict the growth of germi- nating weed seeds by limiting absorbed direct light availability (Malik et al., 2018). Weed germination and growth were lower in ZT in combination with residue management than in ZT without residue incorporation (Fonteyne et al., 2020) which might be due to high soil fertility and soil water content (Verhulst et al., 2011), Table 6 A treatment’s impact on the variety indices of weeds in the maize and wheat crop (pooled).
