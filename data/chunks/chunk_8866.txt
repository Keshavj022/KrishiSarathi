 A 9/4: a high-yielding nutmeg A promising betelvine IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF HORTICULTURAL CROPS 67 as major pests appearing maximum during second fortnight of April and summer months, respectively. About 18% yield loss due to tobacco caterpillar at ANGRAU, 12% yield loss due to mite at MPKV, and 51% yield loss due to scale insect at TNAU, Coimbatore were observed. MEDICINAL AND AROMATIC PLANTS Fifteen gemplasm lines of aswagandha were evaluated at MPUAT. Root yield/plant was maximum in RAs 20 (30g). Total alkaloid yield was highest in RAs 22 (0.61%). In isabgol, 71genotypes including 3 checks, viz. RI 89, GI 2 and Sel 10 were evaluated. Effective spikes/plant ranged from 4.25 in MIB 125 to 15.90 in AMB 6. The maturity period varied from 100 days in DM 5 to 112 days in P 79. Seed yield/ ha ranged between 8,440 kg in DM 11 and 2,331 kg in PB 31. In PB 3-1, swelling factor was 14.25 cc/g. Two strains, PS 19 and HI 1, were found to be immune and strains, PB 62, Palampur 3, P 79 and DM 11 were recorded as resistant to downy mildew. In ashwagandha, application of 100 ppm cycocel enhanced alkaloid content (0.99%) in roots significantly. A combined dose each of 30 kg /ha of N and P emerged as an optimum dose for increasing the root yield of rainfed ashwagandha. Application of Isoproturon at 0.75 kg/ha + hand-weeding 45 DAS emerged as an effective weed control method. In liqourice,HM 1 recorded highest number of inflorescences/ branch (13.3), pods/inflorescence (5.4) and pod setting (23.7%) was recorded in HM 1. Florets/ inflorescence were highest in EC 120170 (26.2). In vertiver, IC 78651 performed statistically significant over the control in root yield and oil content. However, it was observed that total oil yield was about 3 times lesser than that of NDUAT (15.5 litres/ha). In safed musli, MCB 405 gave highest yield (2,056 kg fleshy roots/ha). There is a total absence of self-incompatibility in safed musli. The highest percentage of seed germination, increase in shoot length, number of rhizomatous roots and fresh weight of roots was recorded with seed soaking in GA3 1000 ppm for 24 hr or in humic acid (0.5%) compared to the control. Removal of the inflorescence enhanced length of leaf and tuber and total weight of tuber per hill. Maximum tuber yield (9.5 tonnes/ha) was obtained with 15 tonnes FYM/ha but it was at par with 10 and 20 tonnes FYM/ha. Thirty-two accessions of Kauwch (Mucuna pruriens) were collected and were evaluated for L-DOPA content which varied from 7.43 to 5.4%. Controlled selfing between flowers on the same plant of Glory lily (Gloriosa superba L.) gave best result in terms of percentage fruit set, number of seeds/fruit, seed weight and colchicine content. Application of 3 irrigations 25, 50 and 75 DAS significantly increased growth characters and seed yield compared to 2 irrigations (25 and 50 DAS) in isabgol. Swelling factor of seed was reduced significantly due to 4 irrigations compared to 2 or 3 irrigations.
