 To assess and monitor the vegetation conditions in time and space, various indices based on remotely sensed data have been developed, but Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one of the most widely used indices to effectively monitor and assess the health of vegetation and the occurrence of agricultural drought (Anyamba et al., 2001; Cai et al., 2010; Gopinath et al., 2015; Sandeep et al., 2021). The NDVI and the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) are broadly recognized for detecting agricultural drought in various regions with varying ecological conditions (Wang et al., 2001; Ji and Peters, 2003; Gopinath et al., 2015; Dutta et al., 2015; Sandeep et al., 2021). Agricultural drought is defined as a lack of available soil moisture for vegetation caused by meteoro­ logical drought (Tate and Gustard, 2000). Various studies carried out round the globe found a strong correlation between the remotely sensed vegetation indices and soil moisture content (Dutta et al., 2015; Vyas et al., 2015; Cong et al., 2017; Ambika and Mishra, 2019; Zuo et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2020; Sandeep et al., 2021; Pogaˇcar et al., 2022). The lack of soil moisture caused by meteorological drought is further increased by high surface temperature which intensifies the severity of agricultural drought and impacts the vegetation health. Combined use of remotely sensed vegetation indices and Land Surface Temperature (LST) also capture soil moisture along with the vegetation conditions. Kogan (1995) proposed the VHI by combining the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and the Temperature Condition Index (TCI). The inverse relation between NDVI and LST can be applied to predict moisture level in sur­ face soil. Since the value of TCI increases with LST and the VCI increases with NDVI, thus, high LST represents soil moisture deficits and causes stress in the vegetation canopy (Karnieli et al., 2010). As a result, the VHI represents the presence of moisture as well as temperature or thermal conditions in the vegetation (Kogan, 2001). VHI basically re­ flects health of vegetation and is more closely related to soil moisture content than the VCI or TCI alone (Yan et al., 2016). Carlson et al. (1994) proposed a new index based on the division of NDVI and LST called the Vegetation Supply Water Index (VSWI). However, because of its sensi­ tivity to land cover type, it directly limits quantification of drought severity (Nichol and Abbas, 2015), therefore, Abbas et al. (2014), normalized the VSWI values to make it more efficient (NVSWI), that permits realistic and absolute comparisons. The capability of the aforementioned drought indices varies greatly in different areas, so it is critical to evaluate the performance of a specific drought index prior to using it.
