 Hence in this type of soil, the chaal concept does not seem to work. The chaal has to be lined with some effective sealant, like RCC or polyethylene (UV resistant material). The cost of construction of dug-out tanks is given in Table 9. Cost of construction was highest in RCC tank, followed by polylining and bitumen lining. Although the cost involved in the construction of mud-plastered and un-lined tanks was minimum, their utility would depend on the seepage losses and hence the effective water storage. Data are being collected on water storage Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Fig. 9. Bitumen-lined tank Fig. 10. Water stored in RCC tank natural sources, such as rains, springs and snow, for use in agriculture and domestic purposes. However, chaals without lining are not effective at all locations because of excessive seepage losses. To increase their efficiency in storing the harvested rain water, either the chaals have to be lined with suitable lining materials, or locations have to be identified for constructing chaals, that are low lying and naturally have very low permeability to water. Polythelene and RCC were two very effective lining materials for checking seepage losses in chaals. Since RCC is very expensive, polythelene is recommended as a Table 9.

CONCLUSION These studies have shown that chaal is an effective structure for harvesting water from lining material. Bitumen, being hydrophobic in nature, is also effective in reducing seepage losses from farm ponds, but its mode of application needs to be standardized in loose and gravelly soils. Contents RAIN WATER MANAGEMENT Land shaping (terracing and trenching) was very effective in conserving soil moisture in tree basins by directing the run-off water towards tree basins and harvesting the rain water. The moisture conservation effect was further enhanced when land shaping was coupled with mulching. Pine- needle mulch was comparatively more effective in moisture conservation. The pebble mulch was also effective, and may be easy to apply at on- farm level because of its easy availability locally. However, due to fragile nature of the land scape, the terracing and trenches were damaged due to snowfall and rains, and had to be repaired even after 1 year of construction. The effect of soil moisture conservation through land shaping and mulching was significantly observed on the growth of apple trees.
