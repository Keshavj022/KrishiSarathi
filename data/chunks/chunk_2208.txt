75 million to CGIAR as annual membership fee through Window-I for carrying out collaborative research actives as per Work Plans signed between ICAR and CG Centres (Table 2). Out of these 15 Centres, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has its headquarter at Hyderabad in the State of Telangana, India. The remaining CGIAR research organizations have headquarters elsewhere but have a strong presence in India. They have South Asia Regional or Country offices in India. Through mutual agreements and work plans, ICAR participates in global agricultural research and they benefit Indian agriculture per se. The broad areas of research collaboration with CGIAR system involves: enhanced cooperation in their areas of priority besides germplasm and technology development to achieve targeted crop and animal productivity and quality in India, focussed strategies for joint efforts to address the issues like utilisation of rice fallows, watershed development, rainfed/dryland agriculture and water management and working together for doubling farmer’s income and capacity building. As the mandate of DARE-ICAR is research and education in Agriculture and allied fields, the MoUs and Work Plans generally cover areas like advanced Agricultural Research and Education through study visits and training of scientists, exchange of literature, exchange of germplasm and capacity building programmes. During the last five years, over 1600 Scientists/science leaders were deputed abroad under the foreign collaborative programmes. During the past five years, we could import 175098 germplasm/accessions and export 4153 accessions of germplasm (Tables 3 and 4).

For instance, CGIAR’s biggest contribution is in providing or facilitating transfer of genetic material of different crops from various parts of the world which has been utilized for breeding new and improved varieties of the crops.
