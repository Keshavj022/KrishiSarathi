 Egg: In the S-1 generation of native chicken germplasm being evaluated at KVASU, Mannuthy centre, the egg production up to 40 weeks of age was 72 eggs with average egg weight of 41.8 g. Average genetic response for 64 weeks hen housed egg production in IWN and IWP strains (elite layer germplasm) was 4.77 and 1.65 eggs, respectively, during last 10 generations (S-20 to S-29). The hen housed annual egg production in IWN and IWP was 310 and 304, respectively. The genetic response for egg production up to 64 weeks of age in IWN and IWP strains were 0.43 and 0.78 eggs, respectively, over the last 10 generations at AAU, Anand. Egg production up to 72 weeks was 121.5 and 98.7 eggs under farm and field conditions, respectively, in BND cross [(Broiler × Native) × Dahlem Red]. Narmadanidhi birds produced 171 eggs up to 72 weeks of age at farmers’ backyard. Kamrupa birds produced 71.6 eggs up to 52 weeks of age in field condition. Egg production up to 64 weeks was improved by 6.97 eggs as compared to previous generation in native population whereas egg production up to 64 weeks of age was more in DNB [(Dahlem Red × Native) × Broiler] cross (101.4 eggs) than BND [(Broiler × Native) × Dahlem Red] cross (93.2 eggs) under farm conditions. The DND [(Dahlem Red×Native)×Dahlem Red] cross showed 65.7 eggs hen housed egg production in farm and 39.5 eggs in field conditions up to 40 weeks. This cross produced 148.5 eggs up to 72 weeks of age under farm condition. Meat: The average phenotypic and genetic response for body weight at 5 weeks over 9 generations in PB- 1 (elite broiler male line) was 6.43 and 5.34 g, respectively. The phenotypic and genetic responses for 5-week body weight in PB-1 over the last 9 generations were 10.07 and 24.50 g. The phenotypic and genotypic responses per generation for 5-week body weight were 15.9 and 15.8g, and 14.3 and 14.2g, respectively, in Coloured Synthetic Male Line (CSML) and Coloured Synthetic Female Line (CSFL) lines (Broiler male and female lines). The phenotypic response of CSML and CSFL lines over 4 generations was 111.8 and 68.35 g, respectively, while the genetic responses in respective lines were 94.64 and 51.18 g.
