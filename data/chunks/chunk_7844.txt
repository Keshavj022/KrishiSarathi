041, respectively. The direct heritability for protein %, SNF % and lactose % was 0.441, 0.294 and 0.326, respectively. The goats with AB genotype had highest protein content (3.56%) followed by AA (3.50%), BB (3.26%), BF (3.03%) and AF (2.99%) genotypes. Genetic correlation between protein % and SNF % was moderate and positive. Effect of graded levels of nano-selenium on the performance of the broiler chicken: The body weight and cell mediated immunity in terms of cutaneous basophilic hypersensitivity response (CBH) and humoral immunity of broiler chicken at fifth week age improved when supplemented with nano-Se @ 0.30 ppm, 0.15 ppm and 0.0375 ppm in summer, rainy season and winter, respectively. Supplementation of nano Se also improved the activity of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity and lowered lipid peroxidation values in all the seasons. Selenium concentration in liver, breast muscle, gizzard and kidney and serum concentration of glucose, total protein, globulin concentration also improved in all the nano Se supplemented birds than control. ❑ 19.
