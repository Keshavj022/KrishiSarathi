Box 1: Jaya-The Pride of India ‘Jaya’ the miracle rice variety was developed by Padma Shri SVS Shastry, released in 1968 ushered the green revolution. It is a semi-dwarf rice variety with 130 days duration with a yield potential of up to 5 t ha-1. It has strong seedling vigour, resistance to lodging, early maturing, photo-insensitive, with desirable cooking and eating quality. By breaking the yield barrier, brought self-sufficiency by late sixties to early seventies. Even after glorious 55 years of its release, it is still grown widely across India.
