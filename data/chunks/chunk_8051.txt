 ❑ The frontline extension system as part of National Agricultural Research System of the country has taken up a number of activities through Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) and other programmes for application of farm technology in farmers’ field. Besides taking up technology assessment, refinement, demonstration and capacity development programmes during the year, the other initiatives such as Farmers FIRST, Attracting and Retaining Youth in Agriculture (ARYA), Climate Resilient Integrated Farming System (IFS), Cluster Frontline Demonstration of pulses and oilseeds, Cereal Systems Initiatives for South Asia (CSISA), National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA), documentation and registration of farmers’ varieties under Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Authority (PPVFRA), Pulses Seed hubs, KVK Portal, ATICs, Mera Gaon Mera Gaurav and awareness creation about mega government schemes, etc. were also implemented to espouse the cause of farming community through technology application with their active participation. Technology assessment and refinement Assessment: During the reported year, 3,446 technology interventions across 3,340 locations by laying out 26,029 trials on the farmers field on various crops under different thematic areas, namely cropping systems,drudgery reduction, farm machineries, integrated crop management, integrated disease management, integrated nutrient management, integrated pest management, integrated weed management, processing and value addition, resource conservation technologies, seed and planting material production, storage techniques besides varietal evaluation for cereals, pulses, oilseeds, fruits, vegetable crops and commercial crops. In livestock, 580 technology interventions across 584 locations covering 6,160 trials on animals under the thematic areas of disease management, evaluation of breeds, feed and fodder management, nutrition management, production management, processing and value addition were taken up for assessment.
