 It would also be one strategy for higher fish production.   To prevent increasing fish production by only increasing or converting paddy field to fish ponds, we need to target to hill areas aqua culture to increase farmers’ income.   Cage culture in Loktak Lake could also raise the fish farmers’ income.   Producing good quality fish feed by increasing production of mustard seed, oilcake, etc. as in animal needs to take up as a strategy.   Local fish species like pengpa, khabak fetching higher market value need to be reared.   Local fishes like, ngamu, ngakra,ukabi may be bred separately and raised in organic paddy lowland fields as these fetches very high income.   Insurance coverage of fishes particularly in case of food may be required to retain fish 364 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 famers from restraint.   Use of running water in hills for local fish production as these fishes are more paying.   Utilization of existing water bodies and lowland area (marshy low land) to get additional income for o culture water.   Integrated farming with fish component particularly with poultry, duckery in small holdings.   Enhancement of water harvest for crops with supplement fish component.   High paying prawn culture may also be promoted with proper liming and feeding.   Promotion of feed units for fish would also add rural income generation.   Cold chain and fish processing (drying, etc.,) and marketing may be given major thrust.   Creation of water resources and improve irrigation efficiency.   Popularizing food processing and value addition.   Promotion of packaging facilities and market linkage.   Creating and promoting assured market linkage (including e-market place) with a regional branding.   Development of suitable agri-entrepreneurships.   Provision for transport subsidy.   Fixing of minimum support price at production cost plus 50 per cent.   Commercial nursery under protected conditions – fruits, vegetables, ornamentals, medicinal and aromatics, plantation crop and forest trees.   Commercial plantation of fruits in the hills, integrated with processing/cold chain and packaging – pineapple, Khasi mandarin, kachai lemon, acid lime, banana, kiwifruit, high value vegetables including exotic vegetables.   Protected cultivation of high value crops integrated with processing/cold chain and packaging – High value vegetables, Flowers.   Organic production and collection, packaging, processing, certification – turmeric, ginger, chilli, king chilli, large cardamom.   Organic certification may be clubbed with seed certification agency as in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.   Food processing integrated with packaging – Local fruit crops   Mushroom integrated with spawn production, processing and packaging – Oyster and Shiitake   Bee keeping integrated with honey processing and agro-forestry/suitable crops.
