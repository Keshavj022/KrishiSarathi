 International staff costs were ∼33% of total staff costs, and mostly contributed to intervention development and technical support during implementation, particularly in the AGRI-NUT arm (Supplemental Figure 1). Table 4 gives the cost per intervention from both program and societal perspectives, followed by the cost-efficiency estimates per primary participant and per point of contact. Program costs per primary intervention participant were US$62 in the AGRI arm, US$84 in the AGRI-NUT arm, and US$78 in the AGRI-NUT + PLA arm. Program costs per point of contact were US$0.64 in AGRI, US$0.92 in AGRI-NUT, and US$1.17 in AGRI-NUT + PLA. Societal costs of the interventions Interventions slightly increased the use of maternal care services (such as delivery care, on-site feeding, and malaria testing) delivered by government frontline nutrition and health care providers, but participants did not incur significantly higher out- of-pocket expenditures. Based on the unit cost of these services, the total cost to the health system of this increased demand for health services ranged from US$1680 in the AGRI-NUT arm to US$7793 in the AGRI arm (Table 4). Overall, government frontline nutrition and healthcare workers attended 9388 (in AGRI), 9509 (in AGRI-NUT), and 8012 (in AGRI-NUT + PLA) group meetings. Estimated total opportunity costs of their involvement ranged from US$3326 in the AGRI-NUT + PLA arm to US$4174 in the AGRI-NUT arm (Table 4). Analyses of the endline survey data showed no evidence that the interventions increased participant household expenditures in total or on healthcare, agricultural inputs, food, or nonfood items (8). The estimated opportunity costs to the interven- tion participants from time spent participating ranged from US$209,433 in the AGRI-NUT + PLA arm to US$266,228 in the AGRI arm. Taken together, total societal costs of the AGRI, AGRI- NUT, and AGRI-NUT + PLA interventions were US$549,668; US$621,355; and US$604,762; respectively. Total cost effi- ciency (program and societal costs per pregnant woman or mother of children aged 0–23 mo) was US$125 in AGRI, US$143 in AGR-NUT, and US$122 in AGRI-NUT + PLA. Total societal costs per point of contact were US$1.29, US$1.55, and US$1.82, respectively, (Table 4). Intervention consequences and cost–outcome results Results in Table 5 show that the AGRI-NUT and AGRI- NUT + PLA interventions increased the minimum dietary diversity of children, each compared with the control (adjusted RRs: 1.19 and 1.27; 95% CIs: 1.03, 1.37 and 1.11, 1.46, respectively. Both AGRI and AGRI-NUT + PLA increased minimum dietary diversity in mothers, each compared with the control [adjusted RR (95% CI): AGRI, 1.21 (1.01, 1.45); AGRI-NUT + PLA, 1.30 (1.10, 1.53)].
