 This practice helps improves soil quality and suitable for rainfed cropping systems of Telangana and Karnataka. • India’s rich biodiversity also presents an opportunity for drought-tolerant crop varieties, which can be vital for many areas frequently impacted by drought. Research institutions, including ICRISAT and state agricultural universities, are working to develop and promote drought-tolerant varieties of crops like upland rice, pulses and oilseeds, which are predominantly cultivated in rainfed areas. Pulses fix on an average 25 kg N per ha which is sufficient for growing rainfed pulse crops. • Improved water management techniques, such as drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting, are essential for improving water-use efficiency. Projects like the Rajasthan Government’s Mukhya Mantra Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan have demonstrated the value of these methods by increasing water availability and enhancing crop yields in rainfed areas. • The use of precision agriculture technologies, such as GPS-based field mapping and soil sensors, can help farmers optimize input-use and improve yields in rainfed regions where resource management is critical. • Initiatives like natural farming to be validated with precision agriculture practices, use of minimal chemical inputs and efficient use of water resources in appropriate rainfed production systems. • Remote sensing and satellite imagery are also proving to be powerful tools for monitoring crop health, soil moisture, and weather patterns, allowing farmers to make timely, data-driven decisions. For example, platforms like the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) Bhuvan app provides farmers with real-time satellite data on weather and agricultural conditions. • Early warning systems for weather events are critical in India’s rainfed areas, which are prone to droughts, floods, and cyclones. By providing farmers with advance notice of impending extreme weather, these systems allow them to take preventive measures, such as adjusting planting schedules or protecting their crops. The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ IMD Agro-Meteorological Advisory Services, which issues weather forecasts and advisories to farmers, is an important step toward mitigating weather- related risks in agriculture. • Horticulture holds great potential for improving nutrition, income, and livelihoods, particularly in India’s rainfed areas, which cover 60% of the net sown land. These regions face challenges like poverty, resource dependence, and climate risks, but hardy fruit crops with deep root systems offer resilience by utilizing deeper soil moisture. Conservation of natural resources, especially rainfall, is crucial for boosting productivity. Horticulture aids in diversification, better land use, risk reduction, and economic returns, contributing 28% to agricultural GDP. As demand for horticulture grows, rainfed areas present opportunities for sustainable development through increased productivity and cost-effective farming systems.
