 incognita on infection, development and reproduction of the nematode in tomato. Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus-derived AC4 protein was found to suppress host RNA silencing mechanism and auxin biosynthesis. Use of nanoparticles for disease resistance and quality enhancement: Combination of copper and silver nanoparticles were shown to have better impact against the bacterial blight of rice after two applications than using individual copper or silver nanoparticles. Results on Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae using ZnO nanoparticles suggested the possibility of enhancing Zn content in seed. Identification of germplasm lines resistant to rice blast: Molecular screening of 62 putative rice blast resistant rice germplasm lines, showed three lines, viz. IIABR-265, SD-80 and SD-82 possessing 11 blast resistance genes, 14 lines such as IIBR-374, IIABR-418, IIABR-139, IIABR-422, SD-103, IIABR-286, IIABR- 312, IIABR-262, SK-1, JD-35, JD-82, IIABR-397, IIABR-277 and JD-57 possessing 10 blast resistance genes. Virulence analysis of Magnaporthe oryzae isolates from Uttarakhand: Virulence analysis of 16 M. oryzae isolates using 26 rice blast monogenic lines carrying blast R-genes, viz. Pia, Pib, Pii, Pik, Pik-h, Pik-m, Pik-p, Pik-s, Pish, Pit, Pita, Pita-CP1, Pita2-PI, Pita2-Re, Piz, Piz-t, Pi1, Piz-5, Pi3, Pi5(t), Pi7(t), Pi9, Pil2(t), Pi11(t), Pi19, and Pi20 in the genetic background of a japonica rice variety Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH) along with a susceptible check LTH and a resistant check VL 8657 was carried out. The virulence ranged from 23 to 92% and the least virulent isolate was Mo-nhz-09 collected from Raulsera, Almora, Uttarakhand and highly virulent isolate was Mo-nhz-04 collected from Mukteshwar, Nainital. Among the R-genes tested, Piz5, Pita2, Pi9 and Pizt showed high degree of resistance and Pikp, Pish, Pikm and Pi19 showed low degree of resistance. A total of 16 races were classified and the predominant race was U42-i7-k177-z17-ta513 which showed compatibility with maximum R-genes. These findings will be helpful in deploying identified R-genes for effective management of blast disease. Management module for soil borne diseases of groundnut: Maximum 32% inhibition of stem rot disease and 43% higher pod yield and 36% higher fodder yield was achieved by the module for soil borne diseases of groundnut -M 17A, i.e. Deep summer ploughing with mould board plough + seed of variety GG 20 + seed treatment with tebuconazole @ 1.5 g/ kg of seed + soil application of Trichoderma harzianum S1 @ 4 kg/ha enriched in FYM first at the time of sowing, second at 35 days after sowing (DAS) and third at 80 DAS. Efficacy of sweet flag rhizome in managing bruchid beetles: Sweet flag (Acorus calamus) rhizome powder has been found effective in managing bruchid beetle (Caryedon serratus), a serious storage pest of groundnut.
