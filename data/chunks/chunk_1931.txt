This entire sequence must be repeated multiple times to achieve optimal results. Artificial Intelligence in IoT involves embedding AI technologies, such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, into IoT devices, sensors, and platforms to enable smart decision-making, learning, and autonomous actions. It represents the integration of AI capabilities into IoT devices and systems, enabling these devices to analyze data, make decisions, and perform tasks autonomously. It aims to enhance the intelligence and efficiency of IoT deployments by leveraging AI algorithms and techniques. AI enhances IoT capabilities by enabling the analysis of vast amounts of real-time data generated by IoT devices, facilitating predictive maintenance, and identifying patterns or anomalies. Machine learning contributes to smart automation and behavioral analytics, allowing IoT devices to adapt and optimize processes based on user behavior. In terms of security, AI implements advanced measures such as anomaly detection, authentication, and authorization to safeguard IoT networks. Real-time decision-making benefits from edge computing, reducing latency in critical applications like autonomous vehicles. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and voice recognition enhance human-machine interactions, particularly in smart homes.
