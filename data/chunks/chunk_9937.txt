Cover: Efforts towards Enhancement of Food & Nutritional Security Over the years, there has been a lot of great work in the country in the research and development of biofortified seeds; and I congratulate all the agricultural universities and agricultural scientists for the same. While only one variety of this type reached farmers before 2014, today 70 Bio-fortified varieties of different crops are available to farmers. I am glad that some of these bio-fortified varieties have been developed with the help of local and traditional crops.
