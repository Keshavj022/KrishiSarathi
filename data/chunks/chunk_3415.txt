 Similarly, among the factors of component „organizational climate‟, „general work environment‟, „peer support‟, „supervisor support‟, „strategic link‟ and „task constraints‟ had significant relationship with transfer outcomes of the respondents implying the need for emphasis on these factors to facilitate impact of CAFT programmes. However, the variables, „accountability‟, „positive personal outcomes‟ and „job autonomy‟ had highly significant relationship with transfer outcomes implying the importance of such factors in organizational climate of the Universities. The overall relationship also was highly significant and implies that conducive organizational support climate is very much important for transfer of knowledge, skills and attitude by the CAFT participants back at their job situations. Part IV: Effectiveness of CAFT training programme It could be understood from table 25 that all the training related aspects of CAFT programmes were rated highly ranging from 8-9. This implies that the participants had highly favourable opinion towards pedagogy, andragogy and training environment of CAFT programmes. Part V: Perception of respondents towards constraints in training transfer The information given in table 26 reiterates the information already given by the respondents towards their organizational climate in transferring the knowledge, skills and attitude gained from CAFT training programmes, since most of the listed constraints were responded by majority of the participants between disagree to strongly disagree. However, still there is a scope for improvement with respect to providing adequate resources, prioritizing responsibilities and need for team work in Universities, as nearly one-fifth to one-sixth of the respondents responded in the „agree‟ category towards these aspects.
