 Further trial at the same centre substantiated the previous year's results with additional finding on the moderate efficacy of the ITK in non- parasitic diarrhoea. Considering non- availability of flowers in different seasons, takala (Cassia tora) plant leaves were assessed for their efficacy against E. coli diarrhoea at CIRG, Makhdoom. The leaf extract showed enough potential as an antidiarhoeal therapy in management of diarrhoea in goats. This may be due to its moderate antibacterial property against E. coli and its astringent action due to presence of tannins and saponins besides flavonoids. â–¡ Test compound Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Code Title of the ITK Description of the ITK Name and address of the discloser : 1968 Wound management in animals by use of leaf extract of ridge gourd (Luffa acutangula) or ekdandi (Tridex procumbens) : This practice is followed by the farmers of semi-arid tract of western Maharashtra especially in parts of Pune, Satara, Solapur and Ahmednagar districts.
