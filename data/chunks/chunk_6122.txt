 Treatments There were four treatments: T1, micro- depressions; T2, basin method; T3, micro- depression with grass mulch and T4, basin method with grass mulch (Fig. 2). Moisture content in the soil was determined using a neutron probe at three places (S1 S2, S3) at four depths (15 cm, 30 cm, 45 cm, 60 cm). Soil moisture (% by volume) was recorded at near the plant stem (S1), 30 cm away from the micro-depression (S2) and again 30 cm away from the S2 (S3) at 3 spots for each depth and up to 60 cm soil depth for six trees (replications). Biometric observations like height of the plant (cm) and collar diameter (cm) were recorded for the trees. RESULTS Moisture content in soil More moisture was retained in the treatments under teak and neem compared with the Table 1.

No conspicuous difference was observed between the treatments of micro- depressions and basins during high-rainfall period. However, the difference was significant during low-rainfall period (summers of all the years). During the period of low rainfall, the Fig. 1. Micro-depressions Fig. 2.

The moisture content was maximum at 60 cm depth in both the treatments throughout the period. Moisture content was higher near the plants in micro- depressions and in basins with mulch compared with the plants in basins (Figs 3, 4). Mulching with pebbles did not express much difference.
