 Further, it is important to note that the adoption of SWC measures and the resulting impact are closely tied to the specific location and the topography of the land. As shown in studies such as Birhanu et al. (2019), SWC measures when implemented by the farmers in adjoining fields would result in complementary effects. While the present study does not provide evidence on outcomes attributable to specific SWC measures implemented by neighboring farmers and the mechanism through which the neighborhood effects operate, the overall evidence suggests complementary role played by SWC measures implemented by the farmers and her neighbors, and that such beneficial effects that are more pronounced for the rainfed crops than for the irrigated crops. Overall, the unadjusted estimates reported in Table 3 suggest that the adoption of SWC measures by the farmers and their neighbors’ in­ fluences rainfed crops like maize and cotton is more due to its nature of cultivation compared to irrigated crops like paddy. The next section explores these results further to rigorously estimate the causal effects. 6.2. IPWRA model results As mentioned above, IPWRA approach is employed to analyze the causal impact of on-site SWC measures on agricultural outcomes, viz., aggregate profit, crop-wise profit, and crop-wise yield per acre.9 The probability of adopting SWC practice (i.e., the treatment model) is estimated using simple logit regression model. The predicted probabili­ ties are utilized in estimating the inverse-probability weights. Plot level, socioeconomic, market access and village level characteristics are used to estimate matching score. To check the robustness of treatment effect on treated (ATT) models, the conditional independence and covariate balance are tested (using ‘tebalanceoverid’ and ‘teffects overlap’ user written commands in Stata). The results suggest that the assumption of conditional independence is not violated (see Table A.1). Table 3 Neighborhood Influence on Maize and Paddy Yields.
