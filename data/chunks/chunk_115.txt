Millets, characterized by their adaptability to various ecological conditions, thrive in different parts of the state. These small-seeded grasses, cultivated for millennia worldwide, are hardy crops resilient to harsh conditions like drought and poor soil fertility. Despite their suitability for diverse climates, millet cultivation has dwindled among Jharkhand’s indigenous communities over the past few decades. This decline, coupled with persistent issues of food security and malnutrition, particularly in tribal areas, presents an ongoing challenge. Addressing the dual crisis of biodiversity loss and nutritional security requires tapping into the traditional wisdom of local communities and promoting indigenous crops. The inclusion of millets in the food system becomes crucial for a holistic nutritional approach amid the challenges posed by climate change. In line with the International Year of Millets, aiming to generate domestic and global demand while reintegrating millets into the common diet, the Krishi Vigyan Kendra Ranchi, under the auspices of ICAT-ATARI Patna, has organized a series of recipe contests among rural and farm women in Ranchi district. Participating in millet-based recipe contests, for the village women, presents a unique opportunity to celebrate their rich agricultural heritage and incorporate locally grown millets into their daily lives. These contests not only showcase the diverse culinary traditions of the region but also empower villagers to embrace sustainable and nutritious food choices. By participating in these contests, farm women can share their traditional knowledge of millets, fostering a sense of community and cultural pride. This initiative aims to explore the rich biodiversity of millets and enhance practices related to growing and consuming millets among the local population. In a state where agriculture plays a crucial role in the livelihoods of many, promoting millet cultivation and consumption through millet-based contests can contribute to the economic well-being of local farmers.
