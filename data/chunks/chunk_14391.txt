 Simultaneously, in the remittance receiver category, it can be seen that parents are more likely to invest remittances in agricultural sectors, which supports a study that talks about remittance receivers who are parents may use remittances to support the agricultural activities of their children, who may have greater expertise and knowledge of agri­ culture (Khandker et al., 2013). Based on the findings of this present study, it is evident that left-behind wives do not solely influence the feminization of agriculture; rather, left-behind parents, especially mothers of migrants, also play a significant role. As mentioned earlier, this is further reinforced by the female-headed households, which have a Table 5 Effect of Socio-economic, Demographic and Migration Characteristics on Utili­ zation of Remittance for Agriculture Expenses: Evidence from Logistic Regres­ sion Analysis.

Similarly, there is a significant posi­ tive result between the monthly remittance receivers and total agricul­ tural expenses. So, it can be said that when the frequency of remittance is monthly, the chance of remittance utilization in the agricultural sector is also higher. At the same time, the relationship between landholding and remittance utilization in agriculture is complex and may depend on a range of factors, including land ownership, landlessness, land frag­ mentation, and livelihood diversification. 6. Conclusion In conclusion, the utilization of remittances in the agricultural sector is influenced by various socio-economic, demographic, and migration characteristics of migrants in the Middle Ganga Plain.
