 About 200 exposure visits, 250 field days and harvest days were also organized in which more than 10,000 farmers were exposed to the technologies. The festival of Baisakhi was celebrated as “no crop residue burning day”. The efforts also made 132 villages of Punjab and Haryana free from burning (<80–85% burning) in 2018 covering more than 45,000 ha area. The comparison between fire intensity classes suggest change of about 1.2% (Punjab), 5.5% (Haryana) and 4.6% (Uttar Pradesh) of fire event’s intensity from very high to low. Wheat area under Zero tilled/ Happy Seeder sown wheat in Punjab and Haryana increased to 8 lakh ha. The data for Punjab depicts improvement in the Air Quality Index (AQI). Success Story Management of soil acidity through dolomite application for rice cultivation Rice, one of the major crops in Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu, occupies more than 12,000 ha area in two seasons of the year. Soil of around 50 to 60% of the rice area of the district is acidic in nature. Mobilization and reduction of ferric iron to ferrous iron due to low pH and continuous submergence causes nutritional imbalance and disorder in rice crop. This results in yield reduction due to less productive and ill-filled grains. The KVK Kanyakumari, during OFTs, found that application of dolomite @500 kg/ha during the last plough is effective in reclamation of soil acidity and also adds calcium and magnesium which are deficient in these soils. Training programmes and demonstrations were conducted on reclamation of soil acidity using low cost amendment (dolomite) and application of the micronutrients in different villages. The application of dolomite increased the yield of rice from 5 to 8.32 t/ha. The rice yield increased from 10.5 to 32.2%. Regular application of dolomite also helped in employment generation in terms of dolomite incorporation @ 1 man day/acre. Additional employment can be generated in processing of produce @ 1 man day/acre. The technology has spread to around 3,000 ha in the district. The dolomite application also resulted in an additional income of ` 7,000 to 12,500/ha. TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, DEMONSTRATION AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 129 rearing units by providing 402 rabbits. Fish fingerlings (401.74 lakh) were produced and supplied to 4,757 farmers. Thus, a total of 409.06 lakh livestock strains, poultry birds and fish fingerlings were produced and provided to 45,502 farmers. Soil, water and plant analysis Soil, water, plant and manure samples brought by farmers were analyzed at KVKs, and suitable advisories based on analysis were provided to them. During the reporting period, 5.99 lakh samples comprising 5.60 lakh soil samples, 0.33 lakh water samples, 0.06 lakh plant samples and 0.004 lakh manure samples were analyzed by KVKs covering 13.89 lakh farmers belonging to 0.53 lakh villages in India and the revenue generated was ` 502.21 lakh. Soil health cards (12.27 lakh) were also issued to farmers by KVKs.
