 It was found that Arunachali yak genome has been selected for platelet aggregation and olfactory perception, both of which are adaptive mechanisms to explain the evolutionary processes in Arunachali yak genome. ❑ Circos plot depicting putative regions of selective sweep Livestock Improvement icar annual report 2022-23 70 Breeding and rearing of fishes under controlled conditions: Successful natural spawning of green snapper, Lethrinus nebulosus (Forsskal 1775) was achieved in recirculatory aquaculture system (RAS) in ICAR-CMFRI, Regional Centre, Vizhinjam. It is a large tropical marine fish species that grows to 80 cm in length and 8.4 kg in weight. L. nebulosus were collected from wild and developed into functional broodstock in 10 t RAS system. Fishes were allowed to spawn naturally in RAS. Fertilized eggs were planktonic, spherical, with a single oil globule. Green water medium with combination of algal species was used for larval rearing. Copepod nauplii were used as the first feed, followed by rotifer and artemia in later stages and then were weaned to artificial diet. Metamorphosis of larvae started by 30 dph at a total length of 2.3 cm, and it was completed by 40 dph. A flow-through system was adopted for further rearing, which improved the survival at the metamorphosis stage. Simple non-invasive breeding and culture protocols were developed for four indigenous ornamental fishes of the Western Ghat, commonly known as indigo barb, is found in streams flowing westward in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Goa. Breeding protocols were 4.

To further boost its farming, during 2021-22, ICAR-CIFA signed MoU with five multiplier hatcheries in Andhra Pradesh. So far, over 2 million seed of GI scampi have been produced by these multiplier hatcheries and supplied to farmers. Under field trial, a fish farmer, Shri Bata Krushna Jena from village Nishimala, block Badachana, district Jajpur, Odisha cultured ‘CIFA-GI Scampi’ in carp-scampi polyculture in his 0.10 ha pond. In July 2021, he stocked 1500 post larvae (0.114±0.01 g) of CIFA-GI Scampi, and fish yearlings- 200 catla (160±5.4 g) and 500 rohu (104±6.5 g), 500 grass carp (83±4.88 g) and 100 black carp (75±3.53 g), maintaining the stocking densities of 15,000 prawn post larvae and 13,000 fish yearlings per ha. After seven months of culture period with regular feeding of 5 to 2% of body weight, the final harvesting was done in February 2022. Obtained a yield of 95 kg CIFA-GI scampi of average weight of 72 g and 753 kg of carps and Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) was about 1.56.
