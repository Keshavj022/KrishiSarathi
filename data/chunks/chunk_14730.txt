 Difference in Q/I parameters have been studied under different cropping systems like rice-rice (Islam et al., 2017), maize-rice (Han et al., 2021), rice-oilseed-rape (Zhu et al., 2020), rice –wheat (Zhang et al., 2021) etc. However, such variations due to dif­ ference in cropping system in the same soil needs to be further eluci­ dated as very few studies are available to the best of our knowledge. Lalitha and Dhakshinamoorthy (2015) and Jat et al. (2018) reported possibility of variation due to cropping system; whereas it has been completely ruled out by Johnston and Addiscott (1971). In this case too, the difference in cropping system was not uniformly recorded for all parameters. While it was prominent in some parameters like planar K and CRe 0K, other parameters did not exhibit much variation. Neverthe­ less, the variation in amount of residue added and its chemical compo­ sition, type of root exudates in the two cropping systems may be the probable reasons for the variation recorded. 4.2.2. Labile K (KL) Lower values of KL in comparison to NH4OAc extractable K shows that not all exchangeable K are actually subjected to crop availability. It has been reported that NH4 + can displace K even from specific sites of clay minerals, resulting in higher exchangeable K values (Richards and Bates, 1988; Samadi, 2012) and that NH4OAc tends to over-predict exchangeable K, which is in agreement to observations by Hossein­ pour and Kalbasi (2000), Samadi (2006) and Islam et al. (2017). This may be because of a strong ability of these soils to adsorb K+ on the clay colloids (Nash, 1971). This was likely since the clay contents of these soils are relatively high. The lower KL values in Sc1 may be due to gradual depletion of soil K by continuous crop uptake and no addition of external K either through crop residues or fertilizers (Han et al., 2021; Rupa et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006). Higher values of KL in full CA based scenarios indicate that K in the residue retained is releasing in soil upon decomposition and leading to better availability (Rupa et al., 2003). Table 2 indicates that KL pool was mainly composed of KX evidenced by a greater percentage (54–81%) of KX contributing towards KL pool, especially for the Sc1 and Sc2 (75.4% and 81%, respectively). This finding is in accordance with Zhang et al. (2011) who reported 53–78% of the KL was KX, where 75–78% accounted for treatments without K source. Higher values of labile K indicates better availability of K and it is dependent on various soil factors such as type of clay, fixation ca­ pacity, non-exchangeable K, planar K, CEC etc. (Jagadeesh et al., 2005; Samadi et al., 2006). Addition of large amount of organic matter might influence CEC of soils under different scenarios and in turn impact KL. 4.2.3.
