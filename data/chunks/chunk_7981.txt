 Isolated bacterial endophytes were identified as the Bacillus, Enterobacter and Klebsiella genera. 16S rRNA gene sequences of 32 bacterial endophytes have been submitted and accessioned at NCBI with Accession Nos (i) stem-7 sequences: KY927393-KY927399; (ii) Root-16 sequences: KY911276; KY930702-KY930716; (iii) Leaf-5 sequences: KY927847- KY927850 and (iv) Grain-4 Sequences: KY930332-KY930334, KY962816. Bacterial endophytes isolated from rice, were screened for their efficacy against the stem rot caused by pathogenic fungi Scleratium rolfsii showed variable inhibition of pathogen growth. Managed honey bee pollination in Bt and non-Bt cotton for increasing productivity: The effect of managed honey bee pollination on yields of Bt and its non Bt cotton counterparts revealed no significant differences in the foraging activity of the bees and Minimizing pesticide residues in agricultural produce A total of 246 multi-location supervised field trials were conducted to evaluate persistence and dissipation of new and existing pesticides on various crops in different agroclimates. The data were utilized to fix maximum residue limit (MRL) for 10 pesticide- crop combinations by the Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).Their safe waiting period and label claims were approved by the Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee. After monitoring 22,270 samples of food commodities and water pesticide residues were detected in 4,289 samples (19.3%) while 473 (2.1%) samples exceeded FSSAI MRL. Based on the data submitted to Joint Meeting of Pesticide Residues (JMPR), the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residue (CCPR) adopted the MRL of 19 pesticides on spices. CROP MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017â€“18 60 nectar rewards. Percent boll setting, number of seeds/ boll, seed cotton yield/boll and yield/plant were same in Bt and non-Bt cultivars. Among the different pollination modes, the quantitative and qualitative yield parameters were significantly higher in bee pollinated plots compared to open and pollinator excluded plots. The yields of Bt and non Bt cotton was 9-11 % higher as a result of managed pollination with Apis mellifera bees. Artificial nesting sites for conservation of native pollinators for increasing apple productivity: Installation of wooden blocks and stem bundles as artificial nesting sites in apple orchards in Shopian and Budgam districts of Kashmir Valley resulted in conservation and increased activities of some native bees. Seventy percent of the wooden blocks were found inhabited by wood dwelling Mega chilid bees and 65% of the stem bundles were preferred by Osmia spp. for nesting. Soil dwelling Lassiog lossum bees occupied 95% artificial soil mounds maintained in apple orchards.
