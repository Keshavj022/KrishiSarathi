8% over the units. The average pashmina production of Changthangi goats was 269.11 g in Laddakh region. Preventive health care, provided to 97,546 animals in farmers’ flock, resulting in lower mortality rates ranging from 2.78 to 11.15%, thus increasing population growth and improving farmers’ income from 22 to 35%. A higher population growth amongst breeds resulted into increased selection intensity, thus realized genetic gains could be higher. Farm units have distributed improved animals to different agencies for breed improvement as well as up-gradation of local germplasm. AICRP units conducted 202 training programmes for skill development of goat farmers. Elite does were identified producing more than 200 litre of milk in 140 days in different units. Twenty success stories have been recorded during the period. AICRP on Goat Improvement has bagged Breed Survivor Award for Malabari, Jamunapari and Surti breeds. The project covered 13 tribal villages and contributed for a better livelihood security for tribal peoples as goats are major source of income to poor people in tribal areas and NEH region.

In 15th generation of selection, the gains in 5- week body weight in SML were 14.60 and 12.69 g/ generation on phenotypic and genetic scale, respectively. Corresponding values in CSML were 17.56 and 15.23g/ generation. These values were significantly different from unselected control. Similarly, in Colour synthetic female line (CSFL) the phenotypic and genetic gains in body weight were 19 and 16 g/generation. Corresponding values in synthetic dam line (SDL) were 13.0 and 11 g/generation, which were significantly different from unselected control. The age at first egg for CSML was 177.25 days with 52 week egg production as 108 egg. Corresponding values in CSFL were 176 days and 110 eggs. The fertile eggs of desi germplsm procured from nearby villages were hatched and reared. The body weight at 8, 12 and 20 weeks of age were 510.44, 1,307.50 and 1,483.56 g, respectively. Layer: The overall fertility of selected strain of Rhode Island Red (RIRs) and the control population (RIRc) for 33rd generation was in the range of 83.2 to 91.2 %. The RIRs females recorded significantly higher 40th week egg production (by 40.83 nos) and 40th week egg weight (by 2.27 g), but lower age at the first egg, AFE (by 36.4d) as compared to that of control population (RIRc). AICRP on Poultry Breeding: Under AICRP on Poultry Breeding, all the twelve centres are working on the development of location specific rural chicken varieties utilizing the local native chicken germplasm and elite layer and broiler chicken lines developed earlier under AICRP program.
