00 traversed Dakshin Kannad, Hassan, Tumkur, Kolar, and Chikballapur districts in the southern Karnataka. Figure 4b depicted that the positive residual line traversed Gulbarga, Belgaum, and Bellary districts in the northern Karnataka, along with a belt of five adjacent districts (Bengalore Rural, Bengaluru Urban, Ramanagara, Mandya, and Chamarajanagar districts). In contrast, residual lines with negative values passed through the central, northwestern, and southeastern parts of Karnataka. The correlation coefficient between agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity exhibited an upward trend from 0.162 during 2004–2005 to 0.255 during 2018–2019. This suggested a modest strengthening of the positive relationship between agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity in Karnataka. Furthermore, it was noteworthy that in both research periods, the correlation coefficients remained relatively low. The Ward’s method of the HCA was employed to illustrate the homogeneity of the 27 districts during 2004–2005 and 30 districts during 2018–2019, by considering two variables: agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity. Table 3 provided details of the three clusters, including their cluster criteria and encompassing districts. Within the three clusters, a one-way ANOVA was conducted to ascertain significant differences in the means of agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity during 2004–2005 and 2018–2019 (Table 4). The Levene’s test for the homogeneity of variances indicated that agricultural efficiency (P=0.161) and irrigation intensity (P=0.275) had non-significance during 2004–2005. As presented in Table 4, the one-way ANOVA results rejected the null hypothesis, indicating that the means of all three clusters were different during 2004–2005. Significant differences between cluster means were apparent in each case, with P-value of 0.000 for both agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity, falling below the P=0.050 level. The results from the robust test of the equality of means (Welch’s test and Brown-Forsythe test) further verified that the adjusted F-statistic was significant across all instances (P>0.005), prompting the dismissal of the null hypothesis (Table S1). The findings of the Welch’s test and Brown-Forsythe test substantiated a noteworthy mean difference among the clusters concerning agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity during 2004–2005. To pinpoint specific mean differences between groups, post-hoc test was undertaken (Table S2). The outcomes of the post-hoc test on agricultural efficiency solidified the conclusion that cluster 1 exhibited significant differences with clusters 2 and 3 (P-values of 0.001 and 0.000, respectively) during 2004–2005. However, no statistically significant difference of agricultural efficiency was observed between clusters 2 and 3 (Table S2). The η² was determined to be 0.609, indicating that 60.90% of variances was linked to agricultural efficiency during 2004–2005.
