The state government has given utmost priority to the advancement of agriculture. However, the insufficiency of fodder and feed resources in the state has been acknowledged and articulated on numerous occasions. A shortage of feed and fodder stands as a significant obstacle to sustainable livestock development in the state, directly impacting the income and livelihoods of numerous resource-poor livestock keepers. Various constraints, such as the scarcity of feed, fodder, and concentrates, hinder the potential of livestock, leading to substantial losses in terms of production and depletion of livestock resources. In view of this, KVK Banka has promoted village based round the year fodder production model by integrating various approaches to overcome the shortage of fodder and ensuring a consistent supply of green fodder throughout the year for livestock keepers. It has been observed that integrating more green fodder into animal diets has the potential to lower milk production costs. Also, many farmers start relying on common property resources to fulfil their animals' fodder needs after intervention by the KVK. Keywords: Bihar, Green fodder, KVK, Livestock B IHAR is basically an agricultural state and nearly three-fourth population depends on agriculture, livestock and allied sectors for livelihood. Livestock is a key source of supplementary income and livelihood especially for small land holdings and landless rural poor households. In 2013, about 93% of milk producers were marginal and small, possessing less than 2 hectares (ha) of land, and together contributed about 90% of total milk production in the state. About 80% of the total milk produced in Bihar comes from landless poor agricultural labourers and small and marginal farmers (ILRI 2014).The state currently represents the eight largest dairy market in India and produced 11,502 thousand tonnes of milk production during 2020-21 (AHS, GoI). If we see the impressive growth of dairy sector alone, the productivity of milk in Bihar was 0.
