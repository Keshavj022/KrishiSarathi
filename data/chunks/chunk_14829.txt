 Due to large-scale climate variation in India, the impacts are also varying from place to place, and therefore, some locations show increasing precipitation, and hence there will be a high probability that such locations will experience less intense and lower drought risk. In dry locations, this means that as temperatures rise, water evaporates more quickly, and thus increases the risk of drought or extending drought periods. Similar to the precipitation analysis, we examined the spatiotem­ poral changes in temperature to investigate its impacts. Annual mean temperature was used to analyse the spatial variation of temperature over the same timeframe of baseline reference period (1981–2019). Overall, there was a significant positive trend in all sub-basins, with a slight variation in magnitude. No single sub-basins showed a negative trend (Fig. 7). This demonstrates that temperature showed an increasing trend throughout the past four decadal timespans, which indicates an increasing warming over the GRB area. Rainfall showed higher spatial variability than temperature, with a greater change in magnitude during the baseline reference period. We did not observe any significant reduction in temperature across all sub- basins of the GRB. All sub-basins showed an increasing temperature trend throughout the past four decades (1980–2019), so we assumed a significant increasing temperature scenario in the future for the GRB. Because of the irregular distribution of rainfall over space and time and the prominent issue of water scarcity, we analysed the spatiotem­ poral modelling of drought. Moreover, to investigate the climate change impacts on drought occurrences, we estimated the spatiotemporal Fig. 3.
