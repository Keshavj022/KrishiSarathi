Lac- based coating formulations for fruits, vegetables, seed spices, paper packaging; lac wax policosanol-based plant growth regulator formulation, natural nail shine, lac dye based natural alta, jute lac based bio-composite board, gum based silver nanoparticles, novel super absorbent hydrogels, dietary fibre from gum Arabic and guar gum, gum ghatti and guar gum hydrogel based nanoparticles for wound healing, herbal gulal from Palas flower have been developed. Gummy mass (GM) is prepared from effluent which comes out during industrial manufacturing of Aleuritic acid and constitutes about 80-85% of lac resin. The GM was modified with natural as well as synthetic resins and utilized in manufacture of tackifier and natural adhesive for Agarbatti, thermal resistant insulating varnishes, fibre- glass reinforced sheets and in particle board as a binder adhesive. 6. Adoption of implements, equipment and technologies ICAR has licensed key farm equipment designs to large number of manufacturing industries for mass production enabling large scale adoption of the products by farmers. The most impactful technologies have made a significant impact on Indian agriculture in terms of Technological milestones 1992 New colour variant of lac insect ‘cream’ 1998 Rearing of lac insects away from plant-host 2000 Yellow trivoltine lac insect 2002 Small Scale Lac Processing Unit 2007 National Lac Insect Germplasm Centre 2008 Early kusmi intensive lac cultivation on bushy plant semialata 2008 Late kusmi lac cultivation on ber 2010 Small Scale Integrated Lac Processing Machine 2015 Lac Integrated Farming System Model 2015 Process for dewaxed decolorized lac 2019 Process for cold water soluble tamarind seed gum 2020 Lac based formulation for fruits and vegetables coating 2021 Jute-lac based bio-composite Achievements in Agricultural Engineering in Independent India 301 visibility, spread and increasing net returns of farmers (Table 2). The economic gains of the technologies mainly derived from (a) reduction in cost of operation owing to enhanced operational efficiency and saving of input cost on seed, fertilizer, labour, etc.; and (b) yield gains due to increased input use effciency. The cumulative economic impact of selected only five farm machinery technologies is around Rs. 7032 crore per annum. Table 2.

In-situ management of crop residues The Government of India scheme on in-situ management of crop residue in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi was implemented from 2018-19 to 2020-21 to check burning of crop residue in fields and thus address the issues/problem of air pollution.
