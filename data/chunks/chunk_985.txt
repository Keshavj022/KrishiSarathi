 Keywords: Biofertilizer, City compost, Green manure, Rice, Rock phosphate, Vermi-compost G LOBALLY, fertilizer prices increased by about 80% during January–December in the year 2021. Such increase continued in the year 2022 also. There was an increase of 30% in the fertilizer price during January–April in the year 2022. It is expected that fertilizer prices will remain higher for a longer period, unlike the previous such peak that occurred in the year 2008. The increased fertilizer prices are due to surging input costs. For the manufacture of N fertilizer, natural gas is used as primary feedstock in most countries. The prices of natural gas have increased exorbitantly. Besides, increase in input price, the supply disruptions due to sanctions on Belarus and Russia after start of war between Russia and Ukraine are also responsible for this. Export restrictions in China to meet their own domestic demand of fertilizers resulted in low fertilizer availability and subsequent price hike in global market. The urea prices reached an all-time high from $380/tonne Indian Farming 73 (02): 35-37; February 2023 in April 2021 to $930/tonne in April 2022 (145% increase). During this period, DAP (Di-ammonium phosphate) prices reached to $924/tonne from $555/tonne (66% increase). Such price hikes have crossed the affordable limit of farmers. There is a huge burden on the Government due to subsidy on fertilizers. The amount of such subsidy was only `60 crores in the year 1976–77. It increased to `1,38000 crores in the year 2020–21 and `1,62132 crores in the year 2021–22. For the three-month period during April–June of 2022 only, the subsidy amount crossed `2,15000 crores. There is a steep rise in subsidy amount from the year 2019–20 onwards and it is still continuing. It is not possible to go on increasing the subsidy amount on fertilizers. Also, it is high time to think of minimizing the pollution of soil, water and air due to the use of chemical fertilizers. With this background, the present article describes some practical solutions to the present fertilizer crisis. Promotion of green manuring in suitable agroecosystems Sesbania is a good green manure- cum-cover crop for lowlands and sunhemp (Crotolaria juncea) is very promising for this purpose in uplands. Location specific other green manure crops are also available. It was observed that Sesbania rostrata as green manure- cum-cover crop for the 6-year study period helped in mean saving of 50.0 kg N, 8.3 kg P2O5 and 16.4 kg K2O/ha. It also enhanced energy efficiency and profitability of lowland rice besides improving the organic carbon, available N, P2O5 and K2O content in soil. Considering the potential cultivated area of Sesbania as green manure in about 20 million hectare (Mha) in irrigated and rainfed lowland ecologies, about 1 million tonnes (Mt) N can be saved which corresponds to 8.77% of annual urea production in India.
