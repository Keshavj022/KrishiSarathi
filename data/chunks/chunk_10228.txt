, DMRHP 1402, LPCH 2, and LPCH 3 were also released. The recent focus is on cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) based hybrid to reduce the labour requirement on detasseling. Recently in 2021, the first male-sterile baby corn hybrid of the public sector viz., Pusa HM4 male-sterile baby corn (Shishu) has been released for cultivation. Similarly, sweet corn breeding focuses on overall green cob yield along with the introduction of coloured pericarp and development of high yielding mushroom type hybrids in case of popcorn have been initiated.

Millets In India, millets are grown over 13.8 Mha area with production of 17.3 Mt. The millets production contributes about 10% to the country’s food grain requirement. Millets were traditionally consumed as food but due to the push given to food security through the green revolution in the 1960s, millets were rendered as ‘orphan crops’ and thus are less consumed and almost forgotten.
