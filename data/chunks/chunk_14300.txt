 For instance, integrating double legumes such as Chickpea and Sesbania into the cereal system, as seen in the MCS system, leads to long-term improvements in soil fertility, thereby supporting higher crop productivity within this system (Parihar et al., 2016a). Conversely, the inclusion of double cereals with substantial additional nitrogen input fails to enhance soil health and does not support higher yield (Parihar et al., 2016a, 2018a). Moreover, integrating mustard in the winter season and mungbean in the summer season contribute significantly to the system’s profitability. Consequently, the MMS system featuring double maize exhibits stable yet lower yield, presenting an attractive option for risk-averse farmers. This system, when considered alongside the MCS and MMuMb systems, which support higher productivity and profitability regardless of tillage practices, serves as an ideal choice for farmers aiming for higher returns. While considering the combinations, in general CA-based tillage practices had higher return by ~43,000 INR than CT-based tillage practices, as aligned with a more significant changes in soil properties due to tillage practices than cropping system (Figs. 2,5,7). In addition to considering risk aversion, it’s crucial to prioritize which crop and season the farmer intends to focus on. For example, a risk-neutral farmer primarily concerned with kharif maize might find the ZT-MCS strategy optimal. However, this approach might not align with the maximum return portfolio for overall system net returns, which might consist of ZT-MMuMb exclusively or other optimal strategies for a risk-averse farmer. Consequently, economically speaking, the farmer could miss out a less risky yet more profitable system alternative. Nevertheless, adopting these combinations can pose challenges for farmers with small landholdings, given the multiple constraints they face, including soil conditions and weather variations. In certain places, the soil hydrology and landscape may not support crop diversification. In tandem with the strategy of crop diversification, it’s vital to consider the antagonistic interaction, such as pest and disease profiles, among neighbouring crops before formulating recommendations. Additionally, recommendations for optimal land allocation must account for local- level price risks (Rosa et al., 2019). Despite these practical constraints, leveraging modern portfolio theory to optimize long-term experimental data holds promise in bridging these experiments with climate adaptive policies. For instance, in Europe, Roche and McQuinn (2004) demonstrated how modern portfolio theory could inform the Common Agricultural Policy to encourage farmers to adopt riskier but more resource-efficient tech­ nologies. Similarly, considering the environmental advantages of zero Fig. 3.
