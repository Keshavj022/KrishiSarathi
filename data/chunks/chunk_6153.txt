 Reduction of Chara was found to be 20% at 3 g leaf treatment, which increased to 40% with application of 5 g at 15 DAT at maturity stage. The vegetative stage of gundhi was reduced 100% at 5 g and by 85% in 3 g leaf treatment. Gundhi released in glass jars disintegrated, including the control. But gundhi established itself in potted plants of rice. It showed reduction of gundhi at maturity stage by 20% at 3 g leaf treatment, which increased to 40% in 5 g at 15 DAT. But the vegetative stage of gundhi was reduced by 100% in 5 g and by 85% in 3 g leaf treatment. Results also clearly showed a gradual decrease of dissolved oxygen as well as chlorophyll content in Chara after karada leaf application. The oxygen content varied from 9.8 mg/litre on first day of treatment (DAT) to 0.7 rug/litre on 4 DAT. Similarly, Table 1.

Effect of karada leaf on oxygen release and chlorophyll content in gundhi (2004) the chlorophyll content also showed reduction from 1.83 mg/g fresh weight of algae on first DAT to 0. 33 mg on 4 DAT (Table 3). Biochemical analysis revealed high phenol content of karada leaves, which was 16.4 mg/g fresh weight in comparison with 2.3-2.4 mg in rice Contents PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT leaf. Perhaps this high phenol content is responsible for killing gundhi so effectively. CONCLUSION Karada leaf proved effective in controlling Chara spp, a harmful green algae in rice field and increasing the yield of rice. It is effective due to its efficacy in reducing the chlorophyll content in Chara, which may be attributed to high phenol content in karada leaf. Application of karada at the vegetative stage of Chara was relatively more effective. â–¡ Contents HORTICULTURAL CROPS Code Title of the ITK Description of the ITK Name and address of the discloser Location of use of the ITK Experimenters : 170 Pest management in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) by using leaf extract of Cynodon dactylon : Root rot and damping off in tomato is controlled by applying Cynodon leaf extract. This is applicable only for tomato PKM, 1 (local variety) in Karikuttanoor village district Dharmapuri. Fresh leaves of Cynodon dactylon (doob in Hindi, arugampul in Tamil) are dried in shade. The dried sample is powdered and then mixed with water and placed in an air-tight mud pot and left undisturbed for 24 hr. This mixture is filtered twice, first using gunny cloth and then with a white cloth.
