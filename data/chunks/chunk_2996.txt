 • The plants of anthurium provided with 80% and 75% shade performed better than other shade levels under Vellanikkara, Yercaud and Hessaraghatta conditions. • For commercial cultivation of anthurium, 30:10:10 or 30:20:20 NPK at 0.2 % + GA3 200 ppm + Azospirillum + VAM were recommended. • Maximum vase life of 15.6 days was obtained when the spikes of anthurium were held for 24 hrs and 48 hrs by covering the base of spikes with cotton dipped in a solution having BA (50 ppm) + Bavistin (0.2%) as compared to those spikes which were covered with cotton dipped in another solution containing AgNO3 (30 ppm) + sucrose (2%) for 24 hrs and 48 hrs over the other treatments. • HQ (500 ppm) + sucrose (5 %) for 6h or BA (25 ppm) + carbendazim (0.2 %) for 24h or Al2(SO4)3 (300 ppm) for pulsing of anthurium flowers and AgNO3 (25 ppm) + sucrose (5%) or Al2(SO4)3 (300 ppm) + kinetin (25 ppm) + sucrose (5%) as holding solution for anthurium flowers. www.icar.org.in 7 2002‐2007 5. TUBEROSE • In tuberose, more than 50 accessions were collected, maintained and evaluated at Hessaraghatta, Coimbatore, Kahikuchi, Kalyani, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Ludhiana, Pune, Delhi and Vellanikkara. • In tuberose, Prajwal and Vaibhav had been recorded outstanding. • In tuberose, 200:200:200 kg NPK/ha were recommended for commercial cultivation. • In tuberose, citric acid (300 ppm) + sucrose (2%) at pH 3.6 had been the best pulsing treatments. • For the control of Sclerotium wilt disease of tuberose, treatment of Trichoderma viride @ 20g/m2 followed by carbendazim (0.01%) + Captan (0.02%) were found to be effective at Pune. The applications of carbendazim (0.01 %) + Captan (0.02 %) and Basamid G (40g/m2) significantly reduced the disease incidence under Kahikuchi conditions. • Leaf blight disease of tuberose could be controlled effectively by spraying the plants with Iprodone (0.025%) followed by Difencanozole (0.05%) under Pune conditions. • Bulb treatment with monocrotophos 36 EC proved to be the best treatment in controlling the nematode population in tuberose at Kalyani. 6. GERBERA • A total of 286 accessions of gerbera were collected, maintained and evaluated at Shillong, Pune, Yercud, Hessaraghatta, Kahikuchi, Ranchi, Srinagar, Kalyani, Ludhiana and Vellanikkara. • Gerbera cultivars grown under low cost polyhouse performed better than those grown under shadenet and open field conditions at Yercaud, Kalyani and Srinagar. • In gerbera 20g P2O5 + 10g N/m2 are recommended for commercial cultivation. • AgNO3 (SO4)3 @ 25 ppm was found to be the best for increasing vase life of cut gerbera varieties ‘Thalasa’ and ‘Lyonella’ as reported by IIHR, Bangalore. • In gerbera, Al2(SO4)3 (300 ppm) + sucrose (2 %) had been the best pulsing treatments. • The leaf spot/blight disease of gerbera could be controlled by treating the plants with Benomyl (0.01%) followed by Kavach (0.02%) and difencanazole (0.05%) at Pune, whereas Benomyl (0.02%) was found to be more effective at Ludhiana.
