 Lower water levels in the tube indicate drier soil conditions, while higher levels suggest a higher soil moisture content. There are several types of tensiometer which are summarized in Table 2. 2.1.3. Capacitance Sensors. Capacitance sensors, also called capacitance-based soil moisture sensors, are commonly used tools for measuring soil moisture levels. They function based on capacitance, which involves the capacity of a capacitor to store electric charge between two conductive plates separated by a dielectric material. These sensors, discussed in Table 3, offer a practical and nonintrusive method for monitoring soil moisture in agricultural, horticultural, and environmental settings. Capacitance sensors typically include two electrodes or probes inserted into the soil, serving as the capacitor’s plates. The soil itself serves as the dielectric material between these plates. When the soil is dry, it has a low dielectric constant, which allows the capacitor to store more charge. Conversely, when the soil is moist, its dielectric constant increases, reducing the amount of charge the capacitor can hold [13]. By measuring the capacitance of the sensor, the device can determine the soil moisture content. The sensor typically includes circuitry that converts the capacitance readings into corresponding moisture values, providing real-time data about soil water levels. 2.1.4. Resistance Block. Resistance block sensors use electro- des made of corrosion-resistant materials to measure soil moisture based on electrical resistance which correlates with its moisture content. By providing real-time data on soil moisture levels, resistance block sensors enable farmers to make informed irrigation decisions, preventing overwa- tering or underwatering of crops. Table 4 details the vari- ous types of resistance block sensors. This technology promotes water conservation, minimizes nutrient leaching, and improves overall resource efﬁciency. With the data collected by resistance block sensors, farmers can imple- ment precise irrigation strategies, leading to higher crop yields, reduced input costs, and increased sustainability in agricultural practices. 2.1.5. Crop Health Sensors. Crop health sensors are special- ized devices designed to monitor and assess the health and condition of crops in agricultural ﬁelds. These sensors have a vital role in precision farming as they offer up-to-the- moment information on diverse crop factors. This aids farmers in making conversant selections to enhance crop development, prevent diseases, and maximize harvests [14]. By monitoring key indicators, crop health sensors enable early detection of potential issues, facilitating targeted inter- ventions, and promoting sustainable farming practices. These sensor types, discussed in Table 5, are essential for early detec- tion of diseases, pests, and stress factors in crops.
