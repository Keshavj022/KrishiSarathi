 Feedstocks with a higher hydrogen concentration and less moisture are preferred for increasing hydrogen output [50, 51]. 4.6 Thermal efficiency To improve hydrogen output by biomass pyrolysis, optimizing technical factors for improving thermal efficiency and energy utilization. Effective heat transfer, precise temperature control, and the integration of heat recovery systems are key to minimizing energy losses and boosting process productivity [52]. Researchers focus on increasing the financial feasibility of hydrogen production through optimization techniques, and techno-economic analyses in pyrolysis. Continuous improvements in operational practices support the advancement of sustainable energy solutions and the transition to clean, renewable hydrogen production technologies [53,54]. 4.7 Scale-up considerations To maximize hydrogen production through biomass pyrolysis, technical parameters like temperature, residence time, process optimization, catalysts, and feedstock quality must be considered. Expanding technological capabilities involves thermal effectiveness, reactor layout, and financial feasibility must be considered. Environmental sustainability is crucial through all phases of economic growth [55]. Efficient and environmentally friendly hydrogen generation employing biomass pyrolysis requires a comprehensive method that integrates academic knowledge and practical issues [56]. 4.8 Hydrogen production LCA and sustainability Biohydrogen production is a promising avenue for sustainable energy generation, and conducting a life cycle assessment (LCA) is vital for understanding its environmental impacts comprehensively. LCA findings are particularly significant in the development and application of adsorbents in pressure swing adsorption processes, aimed at addressing environmental challenges [57]. The LCA system comprises four key steps: (a) Goal and scope, (b) Life cycle Inventory (LCI), (c) Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), and (d) Outcome Evaluation. In the goal and scope steps, the objectives of the LCA, its anticipated outcomes, limitations, and expectations are established based on the defined purpose. A well-defined and precise goal and scope are crucial, as they directly influence the accuracy and reliability of the results. LCI refers to the second step of the LCA system. In LCI, a comprehensive inventory of all inputs (such as raw materials, energy, and water) and outputs (such as emissions, waste, and byproducts) associated with a product or process is compiled. The purpose of the LCI is to collect and quantify data across the entire life cycle of a product, from raw material extraction and manufacturing to use, recycling, and disposal. This data forms the foundation for evaluating the environmental impacts in the subsequent LCIA steps. Outcome evaluation identifies key concerns, ensuring comprehensiveness, and performing sensitivity and consistency checks as integral components of the process [58]. Thulasisingh et al.
