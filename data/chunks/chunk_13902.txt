[Vol. 69, Millets, such as pearl millet and finger millet, are drought- resistant and can be integrated with legumes like pigeon pea for better soil fertility and sustainable yields (Upadhyaya et al., 2011). Sorghum followed by chickpea or pigeon pea can maximize land use efficiency (Wani et al., 2003). Carter et al. (2014) opined that one of the main factors contributing to low agricultural output, slug- gish economic growth, and enduring poverty in develop- ing nations is farmersâ€™ frequent exposure to climatic shocks. Crop diversity is crucial, and government initia- tives like the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) highlights this through advocating methods that improve ability of farmers to adapt to climate change. Agroforestry Agroforestry, the integration of trees with crops is a sustainable land management practice that offers signifi- cant potential to reduce carbon footprints while enhancing ecosystem services. India has 80.9 million hectares area under agroforestry practices like alley cropping, agri-sil- vicultural, silvopastoral, agri-silvopastoral, agri-silvi-hor- ticulture, and mixed garden production systems, with key contributions from states like Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Maharashtra, which are at the forefront of advancing agroforestry initiatives (IFSR, 2021). The primary mechanism by which agro- forestry reduces carbon footprints is through carbon se- questration, both in biomass and soil. Trees in agroforestry systems capture atmospheric CO2 through photosynthesis, storing carbon in their trunks, branches, roots, and leaves. Additionally, the root biomass of trees adds organic mat- ter to soil that improves soil structure and SOC stability. Toppo et al. (2021) conducted a study in silvipastoral sys- tem in Ranchi, Jharkhand, revealing that Gmelina arborea, Pennisetum, Sorghum drummondii, and Tectona grandis sequester between 4.31 and 10.65 Mg C/ha. Crops and understory vegetation sequester between 0.91 and 3.31 Mg C/ha, the soil sequesters 9.05 to 10.49 Mg C/ha, and litter accounts for 0.21 to 0.31 Mg C/ha of carbon sequestration. Perennial horticultural systems offer higher productivity, lower resource demands, and better eco- nomic returns, including carbon credits, but transitioning from annual crops poses logistic and financial challenges.
