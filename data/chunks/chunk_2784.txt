 The primers for 'MON531' event are standard and used regularly in the Bt referral laboratory to detect the event for all legal purposes as directed by the judiciary. The primers for 'BNLA106' were based on the flanking regions of the cry1Ac insert of 'NRCPB' New Delhi. The gene construct and the sequences were provided by Dr P. Ananda Kumar, Director, NRCPB and submitted to the GEAC prior to approval. The gene sequences of cry1Ac of Mon531 and the gene sequence from prof lIIimar Altosaar are >99.4% identical up to 1857 bp of the 5' region. The cry1Ac in 'MON531' event of Monsanto is a full length gene and is 3534 bp in length. The details of primers and the brief methods are provided below: Samples: A total of 8 randomly selected packets of BNBt I BtNHH44 (2 each) belonging to different seed lots were used for the study. Twenty five seeds from each packet (2kg pack BNBt and 750g pack of BtNHH44) were drawn and 100 seeds were sent to the GM referral laboratory of NBPGR, New Delhi for independent analysis to detect the cry1Ac event in the seed lots and 100 seeds were tested at the Bt referral laboratory CICR, Nagpur. Thus seeds of 8 different commercial packs representing 4 different seed lots were used for the test being reported herein and the test carried out by NBPGR, New Delhi. peR: Genomic DNA was isolated from both BNBt and Bollgard MRC6301 seeds with the latter serving as reference for the MON531 event. DNA was isolated from 50 seeds, each of BNBt, BtNHH44 and MON 531, using standard ammonium acetate protocols. Seeds of non-Gm were used as control. PCR was carried out with each DNA sample in 25 ul volumes, using the following event specific primers 'MON 531' and 'BNLA106' that are specific for the 5' and 3' junction regions (as separate PCR reactions) as listed below. The amplified prodUcts were resolved on 1.2 % agarose gel and visualized under the Alpha Innotech Gel documentation unit. Primers specific for 'MON531' 5' junction region - Forward primer: 5'-aaccaatgccaccccactga-3' Reverse primer: 5'-<:tccttgtaagcggtcacac-3' Amplicon size: 499 bp Primers specific for 'MON531' 3' junction region- Forward primer: 5'-<:gttttcgccgatttgcgag-3' Reverse primer: 5'-gccaatgcctcgtcgtcattgtt-3' Amplicon size: 274 bp Cot primers - Cotton primers were used as control which amplifies cotton DNA.
