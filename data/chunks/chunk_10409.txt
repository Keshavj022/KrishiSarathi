Timely cognizance of the problems of soil erosion due to rainwater in India encouraged the establishment of Central Soil and Water Conservation Research & Training Institute (renamed as Indian Institute of Soil and Water Conservation) at Dehradun in 1954. The institute has estimated loss to annual production is about 13.4 million tons (Mt) worth US$2.51 billion due to water erosion in major rainfed crops (Sharda et al. 2010; Sharda and Ojasvi 2016). The pioneer work on operationalizing the watershed management through soil and water conservation technologies during 1970s led to development of 47 model watersheds in 16 states. The success of the model watersheds formed the basis for the National Watershed Development Programme for Rainfed Areas (NWDPRA) in 1991 and is being implemented in 29.
