 In low seed setting line (IG96 124), the kinetin treatment showed significant enhancement in number of spikelet and seeds resulting in no increase in seed setting percentage. Furthermore, pollen viability and stigma receptivity were studied using different pollen staining solutions. The pollen sterility of 4-12% was observed in both the seed setting lines using different staining solutions. Pollen viability was found to reduce with time after dehiscence in both the lines. To identify genes involved in embryogenesis, two cDNA libraries were constructed from tissues of ovules representing pre-fertilization (early stigma emergence or 0-DAA) and early fertilization stage (post stigma emergence or 3-DAA) from low (LS) and high seed setting (HS) genotypes of Cenchrus ciliaris. A total of 9,922,396 and 5,831,569 reads were generated from LS from 0-DAA and 3-DAA libraries, respectively. A total of 11,004,158 and 12,676,405 reads were generated from HS from 0-DAA and 3-DAA libraries, respectively. The expression levels of the assembled transcripts were analysed by using threshold value of false discovery rate (FDR) with adjusted p value ≤ 0.05 and log2 fold change ≥ 2. The up- and down-regulated transcripts in 0-DAA library between LS and HS were 405 and 341, respectively. While 24 and 9 transcripts were up- and down- regulated in 3-DAA library between LS and HS, respectively. The important genes identified through transcriptomics study were validated based on differential expression of transcripts. A total of 35 primers representing different functional genes were designed and evaluated for amplification. Molecular cross-talk between defense pathways in rice: Antagonism to synergism: Fourteen key defense genes were previously identified through microarray analysis of global genome expression profiles modulated under combined challenge of BB (bacterial blight) + Venn diagram of DEGs based on pairwise comparison of two libraries (0-DAA and 3-DAA) between LS and HS genotypes UP regulated genes LS (O-DAA vs 3-DAA) LS (3-DAA) vs HS (3-DAA) 24 (3%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 399 (49.9%) 6 (0.8%) 371 (46.4%) LS (O-DAA) vs HS (O-DAA) Down regulated genes LS (O-DAA vs 3-DAA) LS (3-DAA) vs HS (3-DAA) 7 (1.1%) 2 (0.3%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 334 (56.6%) 5 (0.8%) 264 (43.1%) LS (O-DAA) vs HS (O-DAA) Glimpses of National Agricultural Science Fund (2006-2023) 28 GM (gall midge) or BB+BL (fungal blast) in the selected gene pyramided lines. Further, the expression of some key genes like cytochrome P450 family gene, terpene synthase, Bowman- birk type trypsin inhibitor, lipoxyginase, and glucan endo-beta glucosidase was found to be relatively inhibited in plants subjected to combined challenge by either BB+BL or BB+GM as compared to those in plants with single-pest attack. The examination of possible antagonism and their impact on manifestation of resistance showed no adverse effect of pyramiding of the genes on expression of resistance against the target pests.
