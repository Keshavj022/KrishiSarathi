Singh2 and Hari Narayan1 1S.K.S. College of Agriculture and Research Station, Rajnandgaon, Chhattisgarh 491 441 2ICAR-Agricultural Technology Application Research Institute, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh 480 667 The multi-tier cropping system, also known as multi-layer farming, is an innovative approach designed to maximize agricultural productivity for small landholders, especially in tribal areas. By cultivating multiple crop species at different heights on the same plot, this system utilizes vertical and horizontal dimensions to create a multi-layered ecosystem that enhances resource efficiency and biodiversity. Implemented under the Farmer FIRST Programme by SKS College of Agriculture and Research Station, this model was demonstrated in select villages of Chhattisgarh to support sustainable agriculture for tribal farmers. The method allows for higher yields, reduced pest infestation, increased biodiversity, and better economic returns per unit area.
