 2. Seed treatment of Thirum @2-3 g per kg of seed. 3. Seed treatment with Thiamethoxam 30 % @ 10 ml per kg of seed for management of stem fly. 4. Use border crop of castor and sunflower as a trap crop for Spodoptera. 5. Install 16 to 20 bird perches per ha. 6. For management of Spodoptera spray 5 % NSKE or Bauveria bassiana or Numeria relie@ 40 g or Bacillus thruingenesis@ 20 g per 10 lit of water Pigeon pea:   Use wilt and sterility mosaic resistant medium to early duration varieties like BDN-711, BDN- 716, BDN-2013-41 (Godavari), PKV Tara, Phule Rajeswari, etc to ensure higher yield in adverse climatic conditions.   Treat the seeds with biofertilizers and apply recommended doses of fertilizers as per recommendations of concerned universities.   Ensure arrangement of one or two protective irrigation wherever possible.   Intercropping of Pigeon pea + Soybean with 1:2 or 2:4 ratio should be taken for higher yield and monitory returns. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 122   Install 5 pheromone traps per hectare for monitoring and spray 5 % NSKE at flowering stage for the control of Helicoverpa. Green gram and Black gram:   Sowing of green gram should be completed with first onset at minimum 80 mm of rainfall.   Improved varieties of green gram like BPMR-145, BM-2003-02, Phule Chetak, etc and AKU- 10-1 (Black Gold), AKU-15, etc of black gram should be used for sowing.   Seed of green gram and black gram should be treated with Thirum @ 2 g/ kg followed by seed inoculation of Rhizobium and PSB biofertilizers @ 10 ml / kg of seed.   Green gram and black gram can be taken as intercrop in cotton at 1:1 ratio for higher yield and monitory returns. Maize:   Maize should be sown at 75 x 20 cm or 60 x20 cm as per soil type by dibbling method with first onset of monsoon after receiving 75-100 mm rainfall.   Improved and high yielding notified varieties or research hybrids should be used for sowing for achieving higher yield.   Recommended dose of 100:75:75 kg NPK should be applied to maize out of which 50 % N and full P and K should be given at the time of sowing while remaining 50 % N should be applied after 30 DAS.   For the control of Fall Army Worm, treat the seed with 3 g / Thirum per kg of seed, spray 5 % NSKE within 30 days of sowing or at 5 % infestation.   In addition, spray Emamactin Benzoate 5 % @ 4 g / 10 lit of water at 10-20 % infested plants.   Earthing up should be done during dry spell for in situ moisture conservation. Sorghum:   Improved varieties of Sorghum like CSV-20, CSV-23, CSV-27, PVK-801, PVK-809, CSH-25 (Parbhani Sainath), biofortified variety like Parbhani Shakti should be used for sowing.   Seed should be treated with Thirum @ 3 g/ kg followed by seed inoculation of Azotobacter and PSB biofertilizers @ 10 ml / kg of seed.   Kharif Sorghum should be sown at 45 x 12.5 cm spacing by using 7.5 kg seed rate per hectare.
