 These schemes started in 2017-18 with a budgetary allocation of ₹22 crores in Tamil Nadu to cover 2490 units in 2018 and 4300 units in 2019 and covered 19,590 beneficiaries across 35 districts. Odisha initiated IFS as a pilot program in 2017 and covered 30 districts in 2021-22 with a budget outlay of ₹10 crores for establishing 942 models and ₹20 crores for 1884 models in 2022-23. Kerala under ‘Re-build Kerala Scheme’ promoted IFS for resilience and enhanced income generation of farmers in 2018 and covered 14 districts with 21,000 beneficiaries. Telangana has implemented IFS in about 3940 ha area with the involvement of 1270 farm households across 33 districts. Multilayer integrated farming system for livelihood improvement in multiple abiotic stress regions: Multilayer integrated farming system (MLIFS) involves the cultivation and management of various components (vegetables, fruits, and poultry) at distinct levels. These components were strategically combined to address multiple abiotic stresses, including shallow basaltic soils, limited land size with inadequate irrigation resources, and the goal of creating a sustainable agricultural income in degraded lands. In this model (0.12 ha), integration of seasonal vegetables and fruit cultivation alongside the raising of backyard poultry was carried out. Micro-irrigation system was used for crop irrigation, and poultry birds were allowed to scavenge for food, which led to the production of both eggs and poultry. This approach aimed to reduce the cost of feeding poultry while simultaneously enhancing soil quality over time, ultimately resulting in a sustainable and steady income. The water productivity for crop, eggs and MLIFS was 54.0 (₹/m3), 1.61 (No./m3) and 36.71 (₹/m3), respectively. The Land Equivalent ratio (LER) of MLIFS was 1.89. Identification of S. sisymbriifolium and S. torvum as the potential rootstocks for drought tolerance in eggplant: Five wild eggplant species (S. gilo, S. indicum, S. macrocarpon, S. sisymbriifolium, and S. torvum) were used as rootstocks, with the commercial cultivar Suraj as the scion. Grafting was done under controlled conditions, achieving a success rate of over 85% and good graft compatibility. After proper healing, the grafted plants were tested in a greenhouse. They were allowed to establish for 35 days, and then subjected to drought stress for 20 days, while control plants were regularly irrigated at 80% field capacity. Results showed that eggplant cultivar Suraj grafted onto S. sisymbriifolium and S. torvum rootstocks outperformed other rootstocks. These rootstocks exhibited higher shoot fresh biomass, root dry biomass, and root-to-shoot ratio, even after 20 days without irrigation.
