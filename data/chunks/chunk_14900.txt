 Agriculture is essential for reducing poverty, producing food for the increasing population, income and employment generation, rural development, and industrial raw materials. Agriculture is the principal source of livelihood for more than 80 % of the rural people and farmers in India. It also employs over 52 % of the labor force. It contributes 14 %–15 % in Gross Domestic Product. Agricultural production relies heavily on irrigation, affecting agricultural farms’ viability and profitability [4–6]. India’s agricultural sector has seen difficulties overall, primarily due to crops producing little revenue despite rising input costs [4]. Irrigation is crucial for agriculture, particularly in dry and semi-arid areas where there is not enough rainfall to satisfy the water needs of crops [7,8]. Historically, irrigation has relied chiefly on conventional freshwater sources such as lakes, rivers, and underground aquifers. Nevertheless, the escalating requirements of expanding pop- ulations, industrialization, and climate change have pressured these resources, resulting in water shortage problems [9]. Nowadays, waste- water has become increasingly valuable for agriculture, particularly irrigation [10]. Treated wastewater may serve as an alternate water supply for irrigation, helping to decrease the reliance on freshwater reserves [10–16]. For Indian farmers, rainfall and bore wells are the two most dependable ways to irrigate their fields. Most farmers experience yearly crop failure due to inadequate irrigation and irregular electricity and water supply.

Records Bureau indicates that between 1995 and 2018, over 400000 Indian farmers took their own lives due to crop failure, which occurs majorly due to improper irrigation [17]. Solar energy is becoming more important in promoting global sustainable development because of its renewable nature and low environmental impact [18–22]. Solar energy, derived from the sun’s abundant and renewable electricity, has several practical applications such as distillation, heating, crop drying, cooking, pumping, and more [23–28]. Solar thermal systems heat water, air, and buildings.
