 The R2 is lowest in the regression results for the price estimation regarding pomegranate (29%) and highest regarding baby corn (57%). The R2 for the other estimations are in between, with a value of 32% for onion and 47% for okra. This suggests that the share of the variation that cannot be explained is highest for pomegranate, likely due to greater variability in those data. However, all R2 are within the generally accepted boundaries and suggest neither underfitting nor overfitting of the estimations. 5.2. Unobservable selection and coefficient stability One potential source of bias in the results reported above stems from unobserved heterogeneity. For instance, farmers’ negotiation skills may influence the price received at different markets. Second, social networks may enable farmers to secure better product prices, potentially introducing bias and inconsistency in estimating the parameters under investigation. Similarly, measurement error and other unobserved variables have the potential to introduce bias into the estimates, raising concerns about the efficacy of the identification strategy. To address the potential role of omitted variable bias in the findings, we employ the methodology developed by Oster (2019) to assess the robustness of our primary coefficients of interest. Oster’s approach analyzes the changes in coefficients and R-squared values when additional controls are incorporated. By estimating bias-adjusted effects and causal bounds, Oster (2019) provides insights into unobservable selection bias and coefficient stability, allowing for an evaluation of the potential influence of omitted variables on the results. Given that Oster (2019) relies on an exogenous controls assumption, i.e., the omitted variables of concern are assumed to be uncorrelated with all included covariates, we also employ the methods proposed by Diegert, Masten, and Poirier (2022), who provide a novel approach to sensitivity analysis that allows for potential endogenous controls.
