97). SVM has high performance on training and test dataset. This study demonstrated that ML models with high accuracy and low error rates can predict groundwater irrigation quality much faster than conventional methods. In this sense, models can be used to quickly and efficiently assess the water quality for irrigation suitability in large areas. By developing a suitable strategy, the administrators can easily assist the communities to adopt cost and time effective water quality predicting methods for the Arjunanadi River basin in South India. However, additional research is essential to enhance these models. This can be achieved by integrating more environment-related variables, including climate change and land-use patterns.
