 Each was provided with four female goats and one male, ensuring they had the necessary resources to establish their own goat-rearing enterprises. Following the successful introduction of goat rearing, the FFP provided continuous monitoring of the goat- rearing units in the first year. Farmers received technical support during breeding cycles, along with resources like feed and veterinary care. Training programs covered disease management, breeding practices, and methods to optimize milk and meat production. Linkages with local veterinary departments and GADVASU, Ludhiana, ensured that farmers had access to regular medical care for their goats. Additionally, the FFP team helped establish marketing networks for goat products, allowing farmers to receive fair prices and meet market demands. This comprehensive support system has been crucial in helping landless labourers transform their small-scale goat farms into sustainable businesses. Labourers who previously depended on irregular daily wages now have a sustainable livelihood through goat rearing, which has improved their economic stability by providing a consistent, year-round income. A key advantage is the low input cost, as these labourers primarily graze their goats on village common lands or along canal-side fields, thereby reducing feeding expenses. Grazing on open lands enables the goats to consume a varied diet, meeting their nutritional needs and contributing to their health and fitness. The physical activity and natural foraging associated with open grazing result in healthier goats, which, in turn, leads to better growth and milk yield. Supported by the FFP, these landless labourers, once struggling with the instability of irregular wages, have Table 1.

This initiative has empowered them, transforming their livelihoods from precarious wage labour to a more secure and rewarding goat-rearing enterprise, offering them a brighter and more stable economic future. In the first year of adopting the goat-rearing enterprise, farmers earned an average of `7,000-8,000/ month from milk sales, providing a consistent income throughout the year. As farmers gained experience and expanded their herds, both milk production and net returns increased significantly. Data of 2023-24 showed that farmers raised goat kids aged 1.5 to 2 years at an average cost of `3,500/animal. These adult goats were then sold at prices between `20,000 and `25,000, depending on size and weight.
