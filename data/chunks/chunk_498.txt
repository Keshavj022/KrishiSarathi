 SUMMARY Direct Seeded Rice (DSR), when accompanied by suitable conservation practices, shows the potential to achieve comparable or even higher yields than Traditional Puddled Transplanted Rice (TPR), making it a viable alternative to address challenges related to labour and water scarcity. By implementing effective management approaches, it is possible to obtain yields from DSR that are comparable to TPR, despite initial concerns. While DSR significantly reduces methane emissions, it is essential to monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and develop strategies to mitigate increased N2O emissions under aerobic conditions, ensuring a safer environment. Addressing pest and disease dynamics through effective management strategies can help overcome issues related to blast and insect infestation in DSR. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: surajmishras306@gmail.com HANDBOOK OF Integrated Pest Management To reverse the loss of environmental resources and also to reduce biodiversity loss, the Government of India has Integrated Pest Management (IPM) as part of the National Agricultural Policy. Integrated Pest Management emphasizes the growth of a health crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms. IPM is not new – mechanical, cultural and biological tactics were used by farmers for hundreds of years before chemical pesticides became available. Besides, there are IPM techniques that have been developed more recently and are effective in suppressing pests without adversely affecting the environment. The task of spreading the message of IPM across is tough due to poor awareness about the subject among people in line-departments as also among the farmers. The information on integrated pest management as a whole is scattered. This Handbook comprehensively deals with all the aspects of integrated pest management in field crops, horticultural crops under traditional, protected systems. Information on basic strategies and tactics of different methods of management including mass production of biocontrol agents, IPM policy and pesticide registration is provided in comprehensive form. The Handbook of Integrated Pest Management comprises 82 chapters which are well written in lucid language with crispy sentences by the renowned scientists. The role of IPM is elucidated with different pests like Trichogramma, Bacillus thuringiensis, Nomuraea rileyi etc. and agricultural crops like rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, pulses, soybean, rapeseed mustard, groundnut, minor-oilseed crops, sugarcane, cotton, jute and mesta, potato, vegetable crops, fruits, grapes, citrus, banana, pomegranate, coconut etc. This Handbook will provide information of available useful technologies to educate on how to reduce or judiciously use chemical pesticides, safeguard ourselves from chronic poisoning, save the National environment while also reducing input costs and raise farmers’ income.
