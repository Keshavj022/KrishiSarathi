 Lentil (Masoor) Lentil requires cold climate. It is very hardy and can tolerate frost and severe winter to a great extent. It requires cold temperature during its vegetative growth and warm temperature at the time of maturity. The optimum temperature for growth is 18o-30 oC. Well drained, loam soils with neutral reaction are best for lentil cultivation. Acidic soils are not fit for growing lentil. Sowing time for Rainfed lentil sown in second fortnight of October, under ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 146 irrigated conditions first fortnight of November and late sowing in first week of December. Important recommended varieties are- PL 639, Malika (K-75), NDL-2, DPL-62, IPL-81, IPL-316, L 4076, HUL-57, DPL-15 etc. For one hactare area require of 40 - 45 kg small seed, 45 - 60 kg bold seed, 50 - 60 kg for late sown and 60 - 80 kg/ha seed for utera cropping with spacing rows 30 cm. apart and it should be sown at a lower depth (3 - 4 cm). Seed treatment with fungicide thirum (2gm) +carbendazim (1gm) or thirum @ 3 gm or carbendazim @2.5 g per Kg. of seed, Insecticide chlorpyriphos 20 E.C. @8 ml./Kg. of seed and culture: Rhizobium + PSB, one packet each for 10 kg seed. First irrigation at 40 - 45 days of planting and second at pod filling stage. Most critical stage for moisture stress is pod formation followed by flower initiation. Nitrogen 20 kg Phosphorus 40 kg and Sulphur 20 kg is recommended per hectare in medium to low fertile soils as basal dressing. Application of 20 kg Zinc Sulphate per ha in zink deficit soil, rainfed and late sown condition. Foliar spray of 2% urea improves yield. Two manual weedings, first at 25-30 days and second 45-50 days after sowing. Weedicide like Pendimethalin 30 EC @ 0.75 - 1 kg a.i. per hectare may be used as a pre-emergence treatment. Yield - A well mange crop yields about 15 - 20 quintals of grain per hectare. Rapeseed and Mustard Rapeseed and mustard crops are grown on light loam, loam and clay loam soils. Excessive alkaline or acidic soils are not suitable for cultivation of these crops. The land preparation should be done properly with two ploughings followed by planking to get a well pulverized, leveled land with good drainage facility. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 147 Varieties: Varuna, Rohini, Vaibhav, Vardan, Basanti, Urvashi, Kanti, Maya and Ashirvad Optimum sowing time for rapeseed and mustard is last week of September to mid of October. Seed rate of 5-6 kg/ha is sown in rows of 30-40 cm and plant to plant distance of 10-15 cm apart. Thinning should be done 25-30 days after sowing to maintain proper plant population. A fertilizer dose of 50:60:30 kg NPK/ha for rainfed crop is optimum. Application of 20kg Sulphur and 1 kg Boron improves the seed quality and oil yield. Two important diseases of rapeseed and mustard are white rust and Alternaria Blight. For controlling these diseases, spray of Blitox-50 (0.3%) or Diethane M 45 @ 2 g/l of water at 10 days interval is found to be effective.
