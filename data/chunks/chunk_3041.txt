 Methi‐1, RMt‐303, Rajendra Khushba, Hisar Suvarna, Hisar Madhavi, Hisar Mukta, RMt‐305, RMt‐351, Gujarat Methi ‐2 Total 90 Improved technologies developed through AICRPS Black Pepper • The AICRPS centers holds 612 accessions in black pepper. • Under inter‐varietal hybridization programme the hybrid Karimunda x Panniyur‐5 produced the highest yield of 4.2 kg berries/vine. • In black pepper – arecanut mixed cropping system, irrigation with 20 l/ vine/day and fertilizer dose of NPK 100:40:140g/vine recorded highest yield (2.69 kg/vine). • Under drip irrigation trial, irrigation at 2 l/day increased the yield and among the varieties, Panniyur‐5 responded positively and recorded highest yield (2.08 kg/ha). • Addition of traditional nutrient sources like burnt earth (10 kg) and wood ash (2 kg) along with FYM (10 kg) was promising in increasing black pepper yield (6.43 kg berries/vine). • Inclusion of Azospirillum & Phosphobacteria separately or in combination with recommended inorganic fertilizer enhanced the yield in black pepper. • Application of inorganic nitrogen 100% + Azospirillum (50g/vine)/ P‐solubilizer (50g/vine) + 10kg FYM gave maximum yield of 4.84 kg/vine with Azospirillum application and 6.0 kg/ha. with P‐ solubilizers. • Planting of black pepper cutting in solarized potting mixture fortified with Trichoderma harzianum @ 1 g/kg and VAM @ 100 cc/kg of soil was found effective for the management of Phytophthora infection and is ideal for production of healthy rooted cutting. • Application of metalaxyl gold MZ (2.58/l) (2.5g/l) and T. harzianum (50g/vine) and neem cake (1 kg) was effective for controlling black pepper Phytophthora foot rot disease in the field. • Spraying and drenching with Bordeaux mixture (1.0%) during May/June and July/August was also effective. • The anthracnose disease in black pepper was maximum at higher elevations and could be controlled by spraying combination of fungicide containing both carbendazim & mancozeb @ 0.1% as foliar spray thrice during the last week of May, July and August. • Spraying of monocrotophos (0.05%) was effective for the management of scale insects in black pepper at high altitudes. www.icar.org.in 70 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Horticulture Cardamom • The centers hold 273 cardamom accessions. • Two varieties in cardamom ICRI‐5 (1543 kg/ha) and ICRI‐6 (1200 kg/ha) have been identified for release from ICRI (Spices Board), Myladumpara. • Studies on the possibility of supplementing the biofertilizer with inorganic fertilizer in cardamom production revealed that inclusion of Azospirillum & Phosphobacteria separately or in combination with recommended inorganic fertilizer enhanced the cardamom yield. • Inorganic nitrogen (100%) + Azospirillum +FYM –5 kg/plant recorded maximum yield of 213.24 kg dry capsule /ha and inorganic P (100%) + P. solubilizers 50g +FYM 5 kg/plant gave higher yield of 220.32 kg dry capsule/ha.
