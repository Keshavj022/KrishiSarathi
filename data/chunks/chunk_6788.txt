 Therefore, foliar spray at 0.5% ZnSO4 at pre-flowering and pod formation stage in chickpea is recommended to envisage higher yields with increased grain zinc content. The genotypes JG 16, GNG 2171, and IPC 10 62 were found to have increased response to soil application of Zn 38.2 % internal Zn use efficiency A framework for satellite based near real time crop condition monitoring using google earth engine Real time irrigation scheduling in green pea using Tensiometer Crop Management May 2021 Dec 2021 June 2021 Jan 2022 August 2021 Kharif Season Feb 2022 Rabi Season Oct 2021 Mar 2022 Nov 2021 Apr 2022 Crop Health Very Poor (0.0< pixel value>0.2) Poor (0.2< pixel value>0.3) Medium (0.3< pixel value>0.5) Very Poor (0.5<pixel value>0.65) Very Poor (pixel value>0.65) icar annual report 2022-23 94 index (IUEIZn) higher over average value; while the genotypes, GNG469, Vijay and GNG 2171 exhibited higher IUEIZn (32.9%) over the mean value of all genotypes in response to foliar application. Conservation agricultural practices: Conservation agricultural practices improved grain yield of all the kharif (rainy) crops (cluster bean, green gram, maize, pearl millet and sesame) compared to conventional tillage (CT). Permanent beds with residue recorded highest grain yield of kharif crops followed by zero tillage and CT. Permanent beds with residue increased system grain yield by 17.1 and 35.3% over zero tillage and conventional tillage, respectively. Cropping systems significantly influenced grain yield (2,835 kg/ha) and harvest index (34.4) of mustard and recorded significantly higher under maize-mustard cropping system. Significantly higher system grain yield was recorded under green gram-mustard cropping system (4,676 kg/ha). Developing sugarcane based integrated farming system models for small farm holders of sub-tropical India: ICAR-IISR, Lucknow planned and executed the sugarcane based Integrated farming system with objective to develop integrated farming system models for small farm holders. The autumn sugarcane based integrated farming system as Sugarcane + Vegetables (Garlic, Fenugreek, Coriander, Tomato, Cauliflower, Spinach, Carrot, Faba bean, Onion, Brinjal, Green chilli, Cabbage, Pea, Soya, Sauf, Bottle guard, Okra, Cowpea, Cucurbit, Maize) + Horticultural crop (Karonda boundary plantation + Papaya + Banana) + Backyard poultry (Asheel, Nirbheek, Kadaknath, Quail) + Dairy unit (Sahiwal) + Fisheries (Rohu, Catla, Nain) + Vermicompost (Eisenia fetida) + Apiculture + Mushroom fetched net income ₹4,48,202.5/ha and an additional income of ₹2,65,902.5/ha.
