Alternatively, crops that tolerance high salt can be selected. In 9 % (n = 8) of groundwater samples of C2-S1 and C4-S2 zones, where the zone C2-S1 specifies salinity is medium and alkalinity is low. It is preferably for agricultural use. All types soils can be irrigated with this water (Subba Rao et al., 2018). Normal irrigation operations often require significant amount of leaching. Under these water quality conditions; moderately salt tolerant crops are best. In C4-S2 zone, the high saline water quality unfit for irrigation purpose, in cases of strong soil permeability (Aravinthasamy et al., 2020). In 3 % (n = 3) of groundwater samples of the C3-S2 zone (moderate sodium danger water and high salinity hazard water), soils with coarser grain texture with decent permeability can be irrigated. The different strategies are needed to diminishes the salinity. Crops with high resistance to salt are preferable. In 2 % (n = 2) of groundwater samples of C4-S1zone, it shows suitable water for high salt tolerant plants but unsuitable for irrigation on soils poorly drained soils (Mohan et al., 2000; Vasanthavigar et al., 2012; Chaudhary and Satheeshkumar, 2018). 3.2.2. Sodium percentage (Na%) Sodium is a key parameter to consider when assessing whether groundwater quality is suitable for irrigation. High sodium concentra­ tion causes the exchange of Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions, and harden the soil, which decreases permeability of the soil and affects the drainage system (Sakram et al. 2022; Mohamed et al., 2017; Islam et al., 2017). Although most of the Na salts are readily soluble in water, and do not react in chemical processes (Pradhan and Pirasteh, 2011). The Na% values are from 6.9 % to 86.3 % with average of 47.66 % (Table 4) and classified as excellent, good, doubtful and unsuitable (Table 5). About 16 (17 %), 66 (71 %), 6 (6 %), and 6 (6 %) of groundwater samples come under excellent, good, doubtful, and unsuitable types for irrigation purposes. Wilcox (1955) diagram is illustrated to show the integrated effect of Na% and salinity (Fig. 5).
