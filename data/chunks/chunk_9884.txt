 G e n e r a l e d u c a t i o n bonds societies together in time, space and fosters receptiveness to other areas of knowledge, enabling fruitful s y n e r g i e s to develop b e t w e e n disciplines. That is how significant a d v a n c e s k n o w l e d g e , particularly in research, are made on the b o u n d a r i e s b e t w e e n d i s c i p l i n e s . Contrary to it, specialists invite the danger of losing interest in what other people are doing and they may find it difficult to cooperate. It would be dangerous to imagine that memory has become unnecessary because of the incredible capacity to store and circulate information now at our disposal. One has to be selective about what he learns by heart. Exercise of the faculty of thought must entail a two way traffic between the concrete and abstract. In teaching and research it is therefore important to combine the two methods the deductive and the inductive, and a coherent thinking requires a combination of the two. ii. Learning to do Learning to do is more closely linked to the question of vocational training; how can students be taught to put what they have learnt into practice and how can education be adapted to future work when it is impossible to foresee exactly 32 how that work will evolve? In this connection, it is necessary to distinguish between the industrial economies, dominated by wage- earning occupation and other economies, such as farming/ agriculture based livelihoods, that are still broadly dominated by independent and informal work. The substitution of human labour by machines may have the effect of making human labour redundant / immaterial. It is accentuating the knowledge related nature of work even in industry, challenging their capability to make use of advances in knowledge into innovations that generate new business and new jobs. Learning to do, therefore no longer carries simple meaning it had. The ascendancy of knowledge and information, as factors in production systems, is making the idea of occupational skills obsolete and is bringing personal competence to the fore. Technical progress is ineluctably changing the skills required by new p r o d u c t i o n processes. The demand for higher skills at all levels has a number of causes. The juxtaposition of prescribed tasks and individual operations is frequently being replaced by organizations into ‘WORK TEAMS’ or ‘ P R O J E C T G R O U P S ’ . Instead of requiring a skill, which they see as still narrowly linked to the idea of practical know- how, employers are seeking competence, a mix, specific to each individual, of skill in the strict sense of term, acquired through technical and vocational training, of social behaviour, of an aptitude for team work and of initiative and a readiness to take risks.
