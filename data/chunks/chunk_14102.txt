 Kelly’s ratio (KR) Kelly’s ratio compares the concentration of monovalent Na+ ions to Fig. 5. Groundwater quality classification for irrigation (after Wilcox 1955). M.R. Hari Raj et al. Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 229 (2025) 109932 11 that of divalent Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions in water samples used for irrigation (Kelly 1940). If KR is greater than 1, the index indicates that there is a high concentration of Na+, which means that the water is unfit for irrigation. KR values vary from 0.064 to 1.99 with a mean of 0.848 (Table 4). KR value below 1 specifies that the Na+ concentration in the water is low. In the study area, 83 % (n = 78) of groundwater samples are under suitable conditions and the remaining 17 % (n = 16) of groundwater samples are inadequate for irrigation practices (Table 5). 3.2.6. Magnesium hazard ratio (MHR) MHR shows the amount of dissolved Mg2+ in irrigation water and may lead to lower agricultural yields. In general, large Mg2+ concen­ tration weakens soil structure, causing water to absorb more Na+ and salt, reducing crop yields. The MHR in the study area fluctuate between 21.65 and 92.21 with a mean of 45.061 (Table 4). According to Ayers and Westcot (1985) classification, suitable (< 50) condition has 87 % (n = 82) of groundwater samples and unsuitable (>50) has the remaining 13 % (n = 12) of groundwater samples for irrigation purposes (Table 5). 3.3. Irrigation water quality index (IWQI) and its spatial distribution IWQI is a method to evaluate the combined impact of every irrigation water quality variable on crop yields. According to Meireles et al. (2010) classification, there are (1) no restriction (> 85), (2) low restriction (70–85), (3) moderate restriction (55–75), (4) high restriction (40–55), and (5) severe restriction (< 40) irrigation water quality types (Table 1). In this study area 16 % (n = 15) of groundwater samples under the no restriction zone covering an area of 51 km2. Almost all soil types may be treated with this water, because less chance of salinity/sodicity issues with soil and no toxicity danger to plants. About 23 % (n = 22) of groundwater samples are in the low restriction zone covering an area of 232 km2, indicating light texture or preference for moderately perme­ able soil types. This water increases hazards to salt-sensitive plants. Hence, it is advisable to leach the soil in heavy textures to avoid soil sodicity. About 27 % (n = 25) of groundwater samples in an area of 440 km2 have moderate restrictions, showing soils with moderate to high permeability levels, which are good for irrigation. To prevent soil deterioration, it is strongly suggested that salts leach reasonably. It is possible to cultivate plants with a moderate salt tolerance. In an area of Fig. 6.
