 Integrating the crossandra crop as a long-term crop, substituting annual crops like the marigold and chrysanthemum, provided farmers with dual benefits of minimising the cost of cultivation as well as decreasing price volatility as caused by market saturation. Therefore, crossandra presented a promising opportunity to gain maximum profits. Recognizing the potential of crossandra cultivation, Shri Srinivas accepted to venture into this new crop with the support and guidance of scientists of Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (ICAR-CRIDA) in Hyderabad. ICAR-CRIDA is implementing the 'Farmer FIRST Programme', an initiative aimed at improving the livelihoods of farmers through innovative and research- based agricultural practices. The project focused on providing technical support, advice, and practical solutions to many farmers like Shri Srinivas, helping them improve productivity and profitability. Despite the stable market prices and the relatively low production of crossandra in the region, Shri Srinivas faced several significant challenges when he decided to venture into cultivating this crop. One of the foremost challenges was the lack of any prior crossandra cultivation in his village and the surrounding areas. There was no established knowledge base or local experience for him to rely on, making it a pioneering effort in the region. Without other farmers to seek advice from or established practices to follow, Shri Srinivas had to navigate the complexities of this new crop largely on his own. A major obstacle was his unfamiliarity with the package of practices for crossandra cultivation. These practices include crucial details about the proper planting techniques, soil preparation, fertilization schedules, pest management, and harvesting methods. In addition, Shri Srinivas lacked knowledge of the various available crossandra varieties, some of which might have been more suited to his soil and climatic conditions. Without understanding the differences in varieties, selecting the most appropriate one for his land would have been a daunting task. Another challenge Shri Srinivas faced was the procurement of quality planting material. Since crossandra cultivation was not widespread in his region, there was no established supply chain for sourcing high-quality seedlings. The success of any crop depends heavily on the quality of the initial planting material, and without access to superior seedlings, there was a risk that the crop would underperform. Intervention Recognizing these challenges, the team of scientists from the ICAR-CRIDA stepped in with a proactive and integrative approach to support farmer who opted crop diversification. The farmer decided to dedicate one acre of his land to cultivating crossandra. This shift in crop selection marked a significant turning point in his farming career.
