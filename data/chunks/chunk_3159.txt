 In soils deficient in Zn and Fe, 10 kg Zn S04 and 30 kg Fe S04/ha, respectively has to be applied to obtain enhanced yields. For irrigated castor in Rajasthan, nitrogen should be applied in 3 splits, 40 N as basal and 20 kg N/ha each at 35 and 80 days after sowing. In saline/sodic soils, spot application of 2 t/ha FYM and sowing the crop on the side of the ridge has been found beneficial. Besides, adoption of salinity tolerant varieties like GCH‐5, 48‐1, GC‐2 also helps in combating salinity/sodicity problem. For integrated nutrient management in irrigated castor in Rajasthan, application of 20 kg N through castor cake, 20 kg N through FYM, 20 kg N through in situ green manuring together with 20 kg N/ha through inorganic fertilizer has been recommended. For irrigated castor in North Gujarat and Saurashtra region of Gujarat, it has been recommended to apply 30 kg N in the form of FYM, 30 kg N through castor cake, 30 kg N through green manure and 30 kg N/ha through inorganic fertilizer for reaping higher yields.

For groundnut + castor (3:1) intercropping system followed in Saurashtra region of Gujarat, application of recommended dose of fertilizer to both groundnut and castor on area basis is recommended to obtain higher returns. Weeding and interculture Castor is very sensitive to weed competition. In rainfed areas, 2 or 3 intercultures with the help of bullock drawn blade harrows starting from 25‐30 days after planting combined with one manual intra‐row weeding after first interculture effectively checks weed growth. A dicot weed, Celosia argentia appears in very large numbers during the months of September to January and it is not possible to use any implements due to coverage of plant canopy. Manual uprooting of the weeds before flowering is recommended. In rainfed areas with undulated topography, proper preparation of land, sowing the crop across the slope, 2‐3 intercultures and tieing ridges along the rows after the last interculture (40 DAS) helps in conservation of soil moisture apart from controlling weeds, thereby resulting in increased seed yields. Weeds are more serious problem even in irrigated castor. Hence, the crop may need 2 or 3 hand weedings at intervals of 15‐20 days in order to keep weeds under check. Alternatively pre‐plant application of herbicides such as fluchloralin or trifluralin @ 1.0 kg a.i.
