 9 Nyariki (2011) showed a signiﬁcant variation across farm size of modern farming technologies. Akinola (1987) suggested a positive correlation between landholding size and the likelihood of adopting improved technology. 10 Asset index is constructed by applying principal component analysis using the ownership of 22 assets (e.g., tractor, two-wheeler, four-wheeler, etc.). 11 The Kisan Credit Card was introduced by the Government of India to provide short-term credit to farmers during the planting and harvesting seasons. 12 The soil health card scheme, launched in 2015, issues a card that provides farmers with crop-wise recommendations for nutrients and fertilizers based on a soil analysis. 13 Other cultivars include WH-511, WH-711, HD-3086, and HD-2329. 14 Yield is measured as the ratio of production (quintals) and crop acreage(hectare). We measure proﬁt as the difference of revenue and operational cost. D. Varshney, P.K. Joshi, A. Kumar et al. World Development 160 (2022) 106067 4 Similarly, adopters of HD-2967 earned 10 % (column 4/column 2) higher revenue than farmers using PBW-502. Farmers using HD- 2967 had lower operational costs (5 %) than those using PBW-502, but the difference was statistically insigniﬁcant. Overall, the adop- tion of HD-2967 resulted in higher proﬁts (about INR 7,464 per hec- tare) than the adoption of PBW-502. Appendix Table A4 presents the distribution of farmers by the number of social interactions within the sample. Note that we ran- domly surveyed 20 households per village, so each farmer could have social interactions with anywhere from zero to 19 other farm- ers. Zero social interactions would indicate social isolation, imply- ing that a farmer did not discuss agriculture-related matters with anyone else in the sample. Nineteen social interactions would sug- gest that a farmer interacted with every other farmer in the sam- ple. One in 14 (7.2 %) farmers did not interact with anyone else in the sample, and about 4 % interacted with only one other farmer in the sample. About 3 % of farmers in the sample had two social connections, 7 % had three, 17 % had four, 19 % had ﬁve, and 18 % had six social connections. Fig. 2 presents the average social network of farmers within the sample by relationship. On average, a farmer networked with about 3.5 friends, 0.63 relatives, 0.67 neighbors, and 0.14 other farmers. Overall, a farmer networked with about ﬁve other farmers in the sample. 4. Empirical strategy 4.1. Identiﬁcation To select villages for interventions, KVKs adopt a cluster villages approach that covers four to ﬁve villages annually. The model con- siders those villages where farm households are dominated by small and marginal farmers from different agro-ecosystems. A KVK worked in the selected cluster(s) for three years. After that, the program moved to a new cluster of villages elsewhere in the district in a phased-out manner for another three-year cycle to implement similar activities. Fig.
