 Profenofos volatilisation, hydrolysis and photolysis experiments The volatilization, hydrolysis, and photolysis dissipation pathways of profenofos were investigated in laboratory experiments. All experiments were conducted at an environmentally relevant pH of 7, with additional tests—specifically hydrolysis and photolysis—performed at varying pH values to evaluate potential species dependencies. Profenofos does not exhibit pKa dissociation constants between 0.6 and 12, thus minimizing any pH-dependent species effects. An experiment was conducted to investigate the profenofos volati­ lisation kinetics and associated carbon stable isotope fractionation. A pH 7 buffer solution (see Table S-1) was prepared with a profenofos con­ centration of 20 mg. L⁻¹. Aliquots of 1 mL of this solution were dispensed into 2 mL glass vials, which had been pre-burned at 450 ◦C for 2 h. The vials were covered with aluminum foils and left open in a fume hood at room temperature (20 ± 1 ◦C). Samples were collected in triplicate on days 0, 5, 15, 19, 23, and 35 using a sacrificial sampling approach. Additionally, control samples were collected in triplicate on days 0 and 35, which were subjected to the same conditions but kept in closed vials J. Masbou et al.

Abiotic hydrolysis experiments were conducted in the dark within pre-burned (450 ◦C, 2 h) 60 mL amber glass vials. Three buffer solutions with pH values of 3, 7, and 9 were prepared (Table S-1 for buffer composition details) and spiked with 20 mg.L−1 of profenofos from a 1 g. L−1 stock solution. A 50 mL aliquot of the spiked buffer solution was carefully transferred into the amber glass vials, which were then sealed with screw caps, wrapped in aluminum foil, and incubated at 60 ± 1 ◦C. Samples were collected at regular intervals (t = 0, 1, 2.5, 4, 5.5, 7, 9, and 11 h) in triplicate using a sacrificial sampling approach. The pH values remained stable throughout the entire duration of the experiment at pH = 2.9 ± 0.1, pH = 6.8 ± 0.2, and pH = 9.2 ± 0.3. Direct photolysis experiments were conducted at ambient tempera­ ture (20 ± 1 ◦C) using 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) light. The experimental setup included a light-tight enclosure (P/N 701 435, Jeulin) equipped with a low-pressure mercury lamp (LP Hg; P/N TUV G6T5, 6 W Phillips) emitting primarily at 254 nm, with secondary wavelengths contributing 22 % of the total output [24]. Borosilicate beakers (type 3.3, int. ⌀ = 37 mm) were filled with 50 mL of buffered solution (pH 3, 7, and 9, as for the hydrolysis experiment; Table S-1) and spiked with 20 mg.L−1 of profenofos. The beakers were placed inside the light-proof enclosure and irradiated from above. Samples (7 mL) were sequentially taken at t = 0, 3, 4.5, 6.5, 8.5 h. In parallel, dark controls covered with aluminium foil (except on the top), were placed in a light-proof fume hood and sampled at the same intervals.
