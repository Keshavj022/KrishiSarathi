 Greengram varieties: Co (Gg) 7, VBN(Gg) 2, VBN(Gg) 3, CO 8, VBN 4; Rice fallow: ADT 3 Treat the seeds with Carbendazim or Thiram @ 2 g/kg of seed 24 hours before sowing (OR) with talc formulation of Trichoderma viride @ 4g/kg of seed (OR) Bacillus subtilis @ 10g/kg seed. Treat the seeds with 200 g each of Rhizobial culture COG 15, Phosphobacteria and PGPR (Bacillus subtilis sp.) using rice gruel, shade dry it before sowing. (or) 25 g each of each of powder formulation of Rhizobium and AM fungi using binder (polymer), shade dry before sowing. Sowing with seed drill maintains optimum plant population; Installation of micro sprinklers, application of pre-emergence herbicides or early hand weeding before 15-20 DAS; Installation of traps; Foliar spray of TNAU Pulses Wonder @ 5 kg/ha during peak flowering stage; mechanical harvest. Horse gram Variety: Paiyur 2, CRIDA 18R and CRIDA 19 R ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 382 Groundnut Varieties: TMVGn 13, VRI(Gn) 6, VRI 8, CO 7, TMV 14, Dharani, BSR 2 Apply TNAU MN mixture @ 7.5 kg /ha as Enriched FYM (Prepare enriched FYM at 1:10 ratio of MN mixture & FYM; mix at friable moisture & incubate for one month in shade). Broadcast evenly on the soil surface immediately after sowing. Do not incorporate micronutrient mixture into the soil. Pre-emergence application of Pendimethalin @ 1.0 l/ha Apply gypsum @ 400 kg/ha on 40 to 70 DAS depending upon duration of the variety and soil moisture. Raise one row of cowpea for every five rows of groundnut wherever the red hairy caterpillar is endemic. To manage root rot, treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g/kg or Trichoderma asperellum @ 4 g/kg or Bacillus subtilis @ 10 g/kg of seeds. Soil application of Bacillus subtilis @ 2.5 kg/ha with 50 kg of well decomposed FYM / sand at 30 DAS. Foliar spray of TNAU Groundnut Rich @ 5 kg/ ha during flowering and pod formation stage. Sesame Varieties: VRI(Sv) 2, TMV 7, VRI 3; Seed treatment with Trichoderma @4g/kg of seed, Bacillus subtilis @ 2 g/kg seed or NSKE 4%. Intercropping of Sesamum + Redgram (6:1) for additional net returns. Apply 35:23:23 kg N:P2O5:K2O /ha and TNAU micronutrient mixture @ 12.5 kg/ha as enriched FYM. Thinning of excess seedlings to be done to induce basal branching. Sugarcane Intercrop with Dhaincha / Sunnhemp in wider rows and incorporate. Use power weeder with rotavator for weeding and earthing up with ridger to save the cost of cultivation. Trash ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 383 mulching to avoid incidence of early shoot borer. Foliar spray of Sugarcane booster Banana Treat the suckers for 5 minutes in carbendazim 0.1%. Sow sunnhemp/ Marigold on the 45th day; incorporate after a month. At the time of planting tissue cultured banana, apply 25 g Bacillus subtilis / plant. Apply 25 kg ZnSO4 basally.
