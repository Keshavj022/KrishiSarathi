 Long-run trends in estimated agricultural workforce and labour use in crop cultivation: The study provides empirical evidences on temporal changes in agricultural labour supply and assesses its effects on farm economy. The sub-period 1993–94 to 2004– 05 witnessed an increase in agricultural workforce (usual status) by 25 million at annual growth rate of about one per cent. The size of agricultural labour did not increase and incremental agricultural workforce during this period was only due to increase in the cultivators. The subsequent period till 2011–12 witnessed an unprecedented decline in the absolute number of agricultural workers by 37 million at annual growth rate of 2.09%. The decline in agricultural workforce was due to withdrawal of both cultivators and labours, particularly female workers.

During the recent period 2011–12 to 2017–18, withdrawal from agriculture accelerated and another 30 million agricultural workers left agriculture. The withdrawal from agriculture sector during the recent years was primarily led by agricultural labours, while the withdrawal by cultivators decelerated. The growth rate in the decline in the female agricultural workers accelerated to 5.04% during recent period as compared to 4.35% during previous period. Interestingly, male agricultural labours declined at historically highest rate of 7.
