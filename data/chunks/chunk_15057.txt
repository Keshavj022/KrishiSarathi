 (2022) formulated a comprehensive assessment methodology for CRA, using an indicator system that ex- amines agricultural production, farmer income, climate adaptability, and green development to foster sustainable farming practices and food security. These studies demonstrate CRA’s global applicability and potential lessons for India. Despite CRA’s evident benefits, its widespread adop- tion in India faces significant obstacles, particularly among smallholders comprising 80% of the agricultural workforce (Government of India, 2014; Sanga et al., 2021). These farmers are particularly vulnerable to climate-related stresses, including erratic monsoon rains, pest in- festations, and diseases, which can lead to significant economic losses and agricultural instability (Singh et al., 2019; Mohapatra et al., 2022; Singha et al., 2023a; Kumar and Gupta, 2021; Balaji et al., 2015; Kashyap et al., 2017). The increasing levels of CO2 and methane in the atmosphere are exacerbating these stresses, making it even more chal- lenging for smallholders to adapt to changing weather patterns (Das et al., 2019; Sapkota et al., 2019). Empowering these farmers is very important not only to bolster national food security (given their contribution of 70% of vegetables, 52% of cereals, 55% of fruits, and 69% of milk production (Birthal et al., 2011)), but also to achieve climate targets like the ‘4 per thousand’ initiative. Such empowerment remains essential as India’s population is projected to reach 1.7 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2015; Government of India, 2014; Lal, 2016; Swaminathan and Bhavani, 2013). Despite past advances such as the Green Revolution (Chakravarti, 1973; Eliazer Nelson et al., 2019), India now faces significant agricul- tural risks from rising heat stress and fluctuations in soil organic carbon, which can impact food grain production during the rabi season (Tesfaye et al., 2017; Sehgal et al., 2021; Nath et al., 2018). Establishing CRA initiatives is thus critical for ensuring a stable food supply, nutritional security, and sustainable agricultural systems (Rao et al., 2019a). The pressing need for robust policy frameworks and governance support to facilitate CRA adoption also highlights the importance of navigating these complex challenges effectively (Kharrazi et al., 2020; Bawa and Seidler, 2023). Integrating indigenous farming practices, which have proven effective in building resilience, can also enhance sustainability efforts and bolster food security (Aich et al., 2022). The increasing body of literature on climate change signifies a growing acknowledgment of resilience, adaptation, and sustainability as pivotal themes in agricul- ture, reiterating the necessity of climate-resilient practices for food se- curity and sustainability in India (Bremer et al., 2019; Baraj et al., 2024) (see Table 1). While these studies show promising results, variations in CRA’s effectiveness through different environmental contexts raise vital questions.
