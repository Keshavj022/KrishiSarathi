 Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) swung into action by setting up pathways for different stakeholders and provided the technological support for achieving goal. ICAR prepared state specific DFI documents and the Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) in the country were assigned the responsibility of planned frontline extension activities to achieve the target. The KVKs of the country actively participated by responding to the call of the nation with full vigour. The KVKs took the technology- backstopping route to augment farmers' income in the existing cropping patterns and guided farmers to diversify into high value crops, intensive livestock production and agri-business enterprises. It has been observed that farmers are getting the benefit from the technologies made available to them at the right time using the right approaches. It is heartening to note that the field crops, horticulture, livestock, fisheries and supplementary enterprises have contributed to farmers' income. The sector-wise contribution to farmers' additional income in different states stands testimony to the overall efforts. The inclusive nature of the efforts could also be seen from the fact that all classes got benefited from the technological support. It is gratifying to note that the income levels of landless, marginal and small holders have substantially increased due to technological interventions backed by appropriate government policies and schemes. The results are overwhelmingly convincing about the possibilities for increasing farmers' income in various parts of the country. It is time to appreciate the hard work of everyone concerned in this mission. The council salutes untiring efforts of the farmers in producing every grain of food that the countrymen eat.
