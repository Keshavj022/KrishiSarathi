Fertilizer doses of N: P2O5: K2O:: 44:32:40 kg per acre have been recommended as per the given schedule. In general, fruit growers have adopted drip irrigation systems in the arid irrigated zone of Punjab, where canal water is stored in communities and individual water tanks for subsequent irrigation purposes. This system has also been adopted in the Kandi and sub-mountainous zones, where the land is undulating in fruit crops. Prospects The availability of fresh water is alarming under Punjab conditions owing to traditional cropping patterns (Wheat-Rice). Diversification is the best option for reducing the load of irrigation water in this state. Fruit plants are perennial in nature and require a regular supply of irrigation monthly according to the nature of the fruit plant. The precise utilization of irrigation using a drip irrigation system is a viable option for all annual/perennial crops. Therefore, there is a need to standardize drip irrigation and fertigation techniques.

Top of Form The policy should focus on promoting drip irrigation techniques in areas where water and labour scarcity are principally alarming concerns. Additionally, it should aim to boost diversification programs in fruit crops. Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) provides subsidies to the growers to establish new plantations, install micro irrigation systems, construction community tanks/water harvesting systems, etc. in horticultural crops. SUMMARY Kinnow and Guava occupy approximately 68 % of the area under fruit crops in Punjab, whereas 80 % of this area is situated in the southwestern zone of Punjab.
