Email address: director.cifri@gmail.com / Phone No: 033-25920177 2. Mandate and activities ICAR-CIFRI is involved in addressing issues related to sustainable fisheries management in inland open waters for environmental integrity and livelihood. • Basic, strategic research for sustainable management of inland open water resources. • Develop protocols for productivity enhancement in reservoirs and wetlands and aquatic ecosystems health management. • Act as a repository of information on inland open water fisheries resources. • Human resource development through training, education and extension. 3. Salient achievements • Developed protocols for size-specific reservoirs and wetlands for enhancing productivity, implementation of which have led to a 3-4 fold increase in fish productivity. • Characterized fish and fisheries resources, aquatic ecology, ecosystem health and invasion of exotics in important riverine systems, estuaries, reservoirs and wetlands. Further, developed a database on inland open water resources (≥0.5 ha) covering 19 major states. • Designed, developed and popularised ‘CIFRI GI CAGE®’ for cage culture in inland waters. Further, developed CIFRI CAGEGROW® feed for cage culture of pangas. • Developed and demonstrated ‘CIFRI PEN HDPE®’ pen culture technology for carp seed production in reservoirs and wetlands. • Developed database on nutrient profiles of food fishes (NUTRIFISHIN) providing information on species-specific benefits for human health. • Developed ‘CIFRI ARGCURE®’ - a medicine for controlling Argulosis and ‘CIFRI Fish Tanavhari’- anesthetic herbal formulation for fish handling & live fish transportation. Further, developed ‘CIFLIN’ for detecting formaldehyde adulteration in fish.
