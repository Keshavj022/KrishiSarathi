 Despite this, the adoption of frontier technologies remains low in many developing countries (Bergoeing, Loayza, & Piguillem, 2010; Takahashi, Muraoka, & Otsuka, 2020). Existing agricultural extension models in developing countries have been scrutinized for quite some time in the literature (Anderson & Feder, 2007; Davis, Babu, & Ragasa, 2020; Leeuwis, 2013; Norton & Alwang, 2020; Swanson, 2008). Constraints such as lack of awareness, insufﬁcient access to credit, inherent risk, and lack of proﬁciency (Barrett, Carter, & Timmer, 2010; Besley & Case, 1993; Feder, Just, & Zilberman, 1985; Simtowe, Amondo, Marenya, Sonder, & Erenstein, 2019; Wossen et al., 2017) limit the level and speed of adoption. Several attempts have been made to identify best practices for diffusing information, including network-driven targeting approaches to identify seed farmers and individuals in the commu- nity, experimental methods with different variants of training and visitation models, and the use of digital means (Banerjee, Chandrasekhar, Duﬂo, & Jackson, 2019; Beaman, BenYishay, Magruder, & Mobarak, 2021; Magruder, 2018; Oyinbo, Chamberlin, & Maertens, 2020; among others). Magruder (2018) reviews existing extension models extensively and highlights experimental approaches in which different variants of extension practices are evaluated. However, experimental techniques have a scaling problem. It is not clear if methods that appear superior in terms of reach and adoption in experimental settings also do so at scale. To reduce the transaction costs of smallholders seeking new technologies, the Indian government introduced a nationwide model of agricultural advisory services, known as Krishi Vigyan https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2022.106067 0305-750X/ 2022 The Author(s).

KVKs are available at the district level (an administrative subdivision of states) and provide a complete package of demand-driven advisory services to farm- ers—including assisting with the identiﬁcation of suitable new technologies, conducting frontline demonstrations, and organizing capacity-building programs. See Section 3 for details on frontline demonstrations and capacity-building programs. Frontline demon- strations of frontier technologies are carefully conducted under the direct supervision of scientists, who get regular feedback from smallholders that allows them to reﬁne technologies for speciﬁc local environments. Thus, the system is implemented in a learning-by-doing framework.
