 Experiment Data presented in Tables 3, 4 and 5 revealed that colour extracted from arjun was highly durable, followed by asan and soil colours, as the colour effect of arjun was 80% even after a period of 12 months which decreased to 75 and 60% in asan and soil colours, respectively. But in terms Table 2. Matrix scoring for assessing the natural colour making technology in terms of time, ease in preparation and other use Parameter Asan/arjun colour Soil colour Total time spent 90 97 Ease in preparation 64 84 Other use 86 47 colours were preferred by the respondents. In terms of durability, hygiene and easy availability of raw material, the respondents considered arjun/ asan colour superior. On the contrary, soil colour was considered much more cost effective than arjun or asan colour. For assessment of natural colour making technology in terms of time, ease in preparation and other uses, an attempt was made to explore the data. Table 2 show that in terms of ease in Table 4.

Laboratory analysis for estimation of colour/ dye content available in arjun and asan colours, and their solubility in spirit and water was done. Results are presented in Table 6. (Laboratory analysis was done at Indian Lac Research Institute, ICAR, Namkum, Ranchi) CONCLUSION Natural colours of arjun and as an are highly effective. However, considering all the parameters, arjun colour is superior to as an colour. Table 6.
