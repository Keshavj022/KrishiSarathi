 Also apply 275g Urea, 450g DAP and 200g MOP per marla (25 m2) of nursery as basal dose. yy Broadcast pre-germinated seeds uniformly in seed bed and maintain 2-3cm of water till pre-germinated seeds are established in the bed. yy In case any disease symptom is observed in nursery, spray with Tricyclazole 75WP @ 0.06% (0.6g per liter water). yy One or two drainage periods of 12-24 hours are beneficial during first few days of nursery establishment. yy Protected nursery under a polythene tunnel is recommended when night temperature falls below 10oC. Remove the polythene cover during sunny days. yy Apply 250g Urea per marla as top dose ten days before uprooting the nursery. yy The transplanting should be completed between last week of May to 2nd week of June when the rice seedling is 28-30 days old. Any delay in transplanting beyond this date results in a significant yield decline. 30 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS Maize yy Important maize varieties are Shalimar Maize Composite-4, Shalimar Maize Hybrid-2, Shalimar Maize Composite-7, Vivek-45, PusaVIvek QPM-9, Vivek - 53, DMRH-1530 & DMRH-1305 are recommended for areas below an altitude of 1850 meters above mean sea level (amsl). yy Shalimar KG Maize-1, Shalimar KG Maize-2, Shalimar Maize Composite-3, Shalimar Maize Hybrid-1, and Shalimar Maize Composite-6 are recommended varieties for higher belts above an altitude of 1850 meters amsl. yy Maize seed are available at Dryland Agricultural Research Station Budgam, Mountain Research Station Larnoo, SKUAST-K Shalimar campus, all KVKs of SKUAST-K and seed stores of Department of Agriculture, J&K Govt. yy Normal sowing time in the valley is mid-April to mid-May. yy Prior to sowing, seed should be treated with Mancozeb 75 WP or Metalaxyl MZ 72 WP @ 2-3 g per kg seed. yy Fields should be prepared well by ploughing 2-3 times at a depth of 12-15 cm for incorporation of FYM @ 10-15 tons per hectare. yy Under irrigated conditions, Hybrid and Composite varieties should be applied with basal dose of Urea @ 5 and 4 kg per kanal, DAP @ 8.15 and 6.5kg per kanal, MOP @ 3.35 and 2.5 kg per kanal and zinc sulphate @ 1.0 and 0.75-1.0 kg per kanal, respectively. yy Under rainfed conditions, Hybrid and Composite varieties should be applied with basal dose of Urea @ 3 and 2.4 kg per kanal, DAP @ 5 and 4.35 kg per kanal, MOP @ 1.7 and 1.65 kg per kanal and zinc sulphate @ 0.75 and 0.5 kg per kanal, respectively. yy Sowing should be done in lines maintaining a spacing of 60x20 cm for composites and 75x20 cm for hybrids using a seed rate of 1.5 kg per kanal for composites and 1.0 kg per kanal for hybrid. yy Apply Atrazine 50 WP @ 2 kg per hectare 2-3 days after sowing as pre-emergence herbicide. 31 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy Earthing up/hoeing be done at Knee high stage i.e. 30 days after sowing. yy Maize is mostly grown as a rainfed crop; for higher yield, crop should be irrigated at critical stages (Knee high, silking and grain filling) of growth.
