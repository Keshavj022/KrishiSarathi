 Due care was taken to cover all farm size categories of small, medium and large landholding farmers, as well as all social groups, such as scheduled caste (SCs), scheduled tribe (STs), other backward caste (OBCs) and forward caste (FCs) farmers in proportion to their population so that the sample represented the population. The detailed sampling framework is provided in Figure 2. Table 1. Production of bio-inputs by cluster categories (%) in 2017.

Note: The states were grouped into zones based on the standard classiﬁcation of the Planning Commission, India. Two questionnaires were prepared: one for the farmers and the other at the cluster level. The farmer questionnaire was designed and pretested to know the process ﬂow and bottlenecks in implementation at each stage and the impact of organic agriculture on the costs, yields, gross returns and proﬁts of major crops. A cluster-level questionnaire was designed to identify the process ﬂow and the PKVY scheme’s implementation bottlenecks. The cluster questionnaire was ﬁlled up by interviewing any one of the clusters’ members. Data were collected for 2014 (before PKVY) and 2017 (after PKVY) on a recall basis. In addition to the statistical analysis of data from 5760 farmers and 2880 consumers, we collected qualitative data by arranging 12 focus group discussions (FGDs) among implementing agencies and critical informants regarding (i) the problems in the implemen- tation of the scheme, (ii) the constraints in the adoption of organic farming by the farmers, (iii) possible strategies to enhance the area under organic agriculture and (iv) strategies to raise farmers’ income from organic farming. Secondary data on fund allocation, release and utilization patterns were analyzed. The detailed methodology is available in Reddy, 2017 [24]. For analytical purposes, states were categorized as developed and less-developed based on the agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per hectare for the year 2017 to understand the impact of level of local development environment on implementation of the PKVY program [25,26]. States with a higher agricultural GDP per hectare than the all-India average was categorized as developed, and those with less were categorized as less developed states. Accordingly, the developed states included Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra and Gujarat.
