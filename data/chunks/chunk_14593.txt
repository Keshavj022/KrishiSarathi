Description of variables used for the analysis IJSE 48,3 442 The HFIAS scale summarises different behavioural and psychological magnitudes of the food security access domain (Coates et al., 2007; Maxwell et al., 2014). Based on these dimensions, respondents were asked to recall how they felt for the previous four weeks or 1 month (30 days) on nine itemised questions. Respondents were asked if a condition had happened in the past four weeks for which they were to answer “yes” or “no”. With a “yes” answer, a follow-up question on frequency of occurrence was asked to know if it happened "rarely (once or twice in the past four weeks), sometimes (three to ten times in the past four weeks) or often (more than ten times in the past four weeks)" (Coates et al., 2007). The highest total score a household could obtain from the scale is 27 and/or 0 for a minimum. The higher the value for a household, the higher the severity of food insecurity. In the study, the total cumulative score was used for the regression analysis; however, for the description of the food security status of households, the categorisation proposed by Chakona and Shackleton (2018) was adopted. Under their categorisation, households that have food security scores of 0–1 are labelled food secured, 2–7 are mildly food insecure, 8–11 are moderately food insecure and 12–27 are severely food insecure. Similarly, FAO (2008) suggested that the categorisation can be done as follows: most food secure 5 0–11, medium food secure 5 12–16 and least food secure 5 17 or more.
