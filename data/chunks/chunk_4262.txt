Raised bed nursery preparation for healthy seedlings Onion seed is generally sown in raised nursery bed (15–22 cm height) for transplanting in the field. The width of nursery bed should be 0.70-0.80 m and length can be kept 3–4 m. The distance in between two beds should be kept about 45–50 cm. The surface of beds should be smooth and well leveled. June-July is the best time for kharif in the plain all over the country. Sowing of onion seeds should be done in lines in proper spacing at 5-7 cm row distance. Before sowing, seed should be treated with thiram @ 2.0 g per kg of seeds to avoid damage of seedlings from damping-off disease. The soil of nursery should also be treated with thiram or captan @ 4-5 g per meter square area. The nursery soil should be irrigated 15-20 days, before sowing and covered with 250-gauge transparent polythene for soil solarization.
