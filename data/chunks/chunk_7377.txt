 About 1,044 breedable buffaloes are being maintained at institutional Murrah centres for production of high genetic merit male and female calves. There are 15 superior Murrah bulls (3 bulls from CIRB Hisar, 4 bulls from GADVASU Ludhiana, 4 bulls from LUVAS Hisar and 4 bulls from NDRI Karnal are in the XVIII set being used since 01- 01-2019 onwards till June 2020). So far, 234 superior bulls have been test-mated in 17 sets. Data of 581 daughters born from the 13th set of bulls which completed 1st lactation was compiled and bulls were evaluated. Bull no. 2234 and 2269 from GADVASU, Ludhiana ranked first and second with sire index value of 2,688 and 2,619 kg, respectively. The percent superiority over their contemporary daughters was 14.80 and 13.86%, respectively. Elite herds of Jaffarabadi, Surti, Bhadawari and Nili Ravi breeds of buffaloes have been established in their respective breeding tracts. Semen freezing laboratories have been established at all the centres. Nili-Ravi and Bhadawari breed centres are functioning as conservation and improvement units, and Jaffarabadi and Surti breed centre are concentrating on field progeny testing along with maintaining the elite herd for bull production and testing. A breedable herd of 682 of four breeds (Nili- Ravi-355, Jaffarabadi-213, Surti-66 and Bhadawari-48) is being maintained. A total of 404,827 semen doses produced and 450,262 semen doses were sold/used.

Sheep The project includes farm and field based cooperating centres located in various ICAR Institutes and SAUs/ SVUs. Presently, there are six ongoing cooperating centres with its coordinating unit at ICAR-CSWRI, Avikanagar. Four of these units are farm based units while two of them are field based units.
