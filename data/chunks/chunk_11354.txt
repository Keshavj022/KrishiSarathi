 If the seed raised from autumn crop is to be used for spring planting, its dormancy should be broken by dipping cut tubers in a solution of 1% Thiourea and 1 ppm Gibberellic Acid (one ml per 100 litres of water) for an hour followed by air drying the treated tuber pieces for 24 hours in thin layers in shade. Time of Sowing: The best time for sowing is last week of September to mid-October for the autumn crop and the second fortnight of January for the spring crop. Method of Planting: For mechanized planting, the spacing between the rows and tuber should be kept 65×18.5 cm or 75 cm×15 cm respectively depending upon the available machinery. Manures and Fertilizers: Twenty tonnes of farmyard manure or green manuring along with 75 kg of N (165 kg of Urea), 25 kg of ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 35 P2O5 (155 kg of Single Superphosphate) and 25 kg of K2O (40 kg of Muriate of Potash) per acre should be used. Drill all P2O5 and K2O and half N at sowing and the remaining N at the time of earthing- up. Earthing-up: A double mould board plough or a ridger should be used for earthing up after 25-30 days of sowing. Weed Control: Application of paddy straw mulch @24 q/acre immediately after planting. Sencor/Tanoshi 70 WP (metribuzin) @ 200 g as pre-emergence. Chilli Improved Hybrids/Varieties Hybrids: CH-27, CH-3, CH-1 Varieties: Punjab Sindhuri, Punjab Tej, Punjab Surkh, Punjab Guchhedar Sowing Time: The seed is sown in nursery during end October to mid November. Transplanting is generally done in February- March. Seed Rate: Seed rate is 200 g per acre when sown in the nursery. Sow nursery in one marla (25m2) area to transplant one acre. Nursery: To ensure successful growing of healthy seedlings from costly hybrid seed of chilli, nursery should be grown under polyhouse (size 24’ × 13’ × 6’) made of UV stabilized low density polyethylene film of 200 microns (800 guage) thickness. Time of sowing under polyhouse Time of transplanting a) Third week of November Mid February b) First week of February End of April Spacing: Thick and stout seedlings perform better than tall seedlings and should be planted on ridges at 75 cm apart with plant to plant spacing of 45 cm. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 36 Manures and Fertilizers: Apply well–rotten farmyard manure 10- 15 tonnes or 6 quintal paddy straw compost per acre for improving the soil health and yield in chilli. The recommended doses of fertilizers are 25 kg of N (55 kg of Urea) and 12 kg of P2O5 (75 kg of Single Superphosphate) and 12 kg of K2O (20 kg of Muriate of Potash) per acre. Whole P2O5 and K2O together with 1/2 N should be drilled at transplanting and the remaining N should be top dressed after first picking. Apply 30 kg N (65 kg urea) per acre to hybrid chilli. Growth Regulator: Due to high temperature in May-June dropping of flowers take place.
