However, more than two thirds of Indian farmers being small and marginal, their farm income is inadequate to meet family needs satisfactorily. Higher rate of inflation than the rate of nominal growth in farm income and tremendous enhancement in the family expenses mainly on account of children’s education and medical care have led Indian farmers into the state of financial distress and despair. As the rate of growth of farmers’ income is much slower than the rate of growth of expenses of the farm families, this financial discomfort is becoming deeper and deeper with the passage of time. Scenario of farmers’ income The report of the Situation Assessment Survey of the NSSO (2012-13) provides benchmarks on farmers’ component wise income and size categories (Table 1). The survey highlighted that there were slightly more than 9 crore farm families in India out of which about 86.6% were having 2 ha or less holding size of their farming. The average holding size of Indian farmer was 1.036 ha and average farming income of an average farmer was ` 36,960 per year. However, the family income of an average farmer was ` 77,888 per year. More than two thirds of India farmers had farm size equal to or less than 1 ha. Why doubling farmers’ income is a difficult task? Past performance of growth of farmers’ income in one decade during 2002-03 and 2012-13 (Table 2) depicts a 3.1 times nominal enhancement. However, when farmers’ 2012-13 income was adjusted to Consumer Price Index (to set aside inflation) the farmers’ real income increased with meagre 1.04 times. If we leave aside the seven years under consideration for doubling farmers’ income (i.e. 2015-16 to 2022-23) and take full decade of 2013-14 to 2022-23 into account even then the past performance paints a gloomy picture.
