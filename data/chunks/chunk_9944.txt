 yy Developed eco-friendly edible packaging film using green seaweed for reducing polythene footprints. 3. Oil Palm Development Programme During last 5 years, almost 58% of the total domestic edible oil demand of the country was met by imports and palm oil constituted bulk of these imports. Oil palm is known to be the highest edible oil yielding perennial crop that satisfies 30% of the world’s edible oil requirements. In India, almost 19.33 lakh ha area is considered suitable for oil palm cultivation but presently only 3.49 lakh ha area has been covered. The crop urgently needs promotion for expansion of area and commercialization in the country. ICAR is continuously conducting research on the crop since 1975 to support oil palm development programmes in the country. The major achievements during the year are briefly highlighted here: Plant, tubers and value added products of greater yam accession Da-340 9 DARE–ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2021-22 yy Developed new 3rd generation hybrids with targeted high oil yield of 7-8 tones/ha and dwarf hybrids with oil yield of 7 tonnes/ha. yy A process and a kit were developed to facilitate controlled pollination in Oil Palm through Insects (Patent granted IPO No. 387063). yy Developed fertigation technique for oil palm- Reported saving of 50 % of recommended fertilizer. yy Identified more fresh fruit bunch yielding three germplasm of Dura oil palms (as female parent), three short stature dura type, and one Tenera type oil palm genotypes. yy Identified three high yielding oil palm varieties for release and notification for cultivation in Andhra Pradesh (Godavari Swarna), Maharashtra and Goa (Godavari Ratna) and Tamil Nadu (Godavari Gold). yy National Mission on Edible Oil (NMEO) -Oil Palm   Prepared and submitted Reassessment Report on suitability of oil palm cultivation in India.   Developed and released oil palm site suitability evaluation mobile application software for farmers’ use at micro level.   Conducted Twenty capacity building programmes on oil palm cultivation to 215 officers and 1,375 farmers of Telangana, North Eastern Regions and other oil palm growing states.
