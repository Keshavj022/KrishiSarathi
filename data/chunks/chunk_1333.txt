 Assuming a dairy animal loses 8 litres of production for 152 days (half the lactation period of 305 days) at an average milk price of `50/litre, the loss from reduced milk production alone amounts to `60,800—the most significant of all losses. However, most of these losses can be largely prevented by administering an oral magnet, which costs only `200. In summary, feeding oral magnets is a cost-effective, practical solution to prevent TRP in dairy cattle, promoting healthier animals and reducing costs, ultimately enhancing farm productivity. Way forward The way forward in using oral magnets to prevent TRP in animals involves optimizing usage, improving preventive strategies, and incorporating emerging technologies. Oral magnets should be considered for routine preventive use, with efforts to promote wider adoption in high-risk areas. Educating farmers on proper administration techniques can significantly increase usage. Awareness campaigns, including successful case studies, can encourage adoption on a larger scale. Development of stronger and more efficient magnets, possibly with optimized shapes for enhanced trapping capacity, could further improve efficacy. Research into magnets that can trap smaller particles or non-metallic foreign objects would expand their utility. Long-lasting, bio-safe coatings for magnets could improve longevity and reduce any degradation over the animal’s lifetime. Additionally, technologies that allow for monitoring or verifying the magnet’s position in the rumen or reticulum could ensure its effectiveness and stability, possibly using imaging systems or small detectable tags. Efforts should also focus on creating smart magnets with sensors to detect metal or alert farmers when a foreign object is captured. Continued research into materials or technologies that enhance oral magnet effectiveness will ensure TRP prevention keeps pace with evolving challenges on farms. SUMMARY Traumatic reticuloperitonitis (TRP) can have significant economic impacts on dairy farming due to reduced milk production, veterinary expenses, livestock loss, and increased labour costs. Early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are key to minimizing the financial impact of this condition. By investing in preventive strategies and improving farm management practices, dairy farmers can protect their herds, maintain productivity, and sustain profitability. Preventing TRP centers around environmental cleanliness, safe feeding practices, and mechanical prevention using magnets. These strategies help reduce the risk of cattle ingesting sharp objects, thus promoting overall dairy animal health and productivity. Of all the strategies, oral magnet therapy has proven highly effective in preventing TRP, resulting in reduced economic losses, higher productivity, and enhanced animal welfare. Oral magnets are easy to administer and provide lasting protection against the disease.
