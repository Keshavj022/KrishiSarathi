SUCCESS STORIES 1. Raised bed planting of soybean in Madhya Pradesh Soybean is one of the major oilseed crops in Madhya Pradesh and mostly sowing is on raised bed planting method (54% area). Change from line sowing method to raised bed planting and more effective control over irrigation and drainage as well as their impacts on transport and transformations of nutrients, and rainwater management. It saves the water from 30% to 50% compared to line sowing method The advantages in terms of saving of precious resources and yield increase, the demonstrations were conducted by KVKs on Furrow Irrigated Raised Bed planting method, particularly in soybean crop Large scale adoption of raised bed planting of soybean in Madhya Pradesh on following points: Number of raise bed machines – 56000 (Seed drill with attachment) Efforts made by KVKs of Popularization of this technology – FLD, KVKs- ATMA Converge, CFLD on Oilseeds & Pulses, NICRA, Farmer First Adoption of this technology during 2016-17 - Total soybean cultivated area in MP (59.06 lakh ha) which covered of raised bed planting method (32 Lakh ha).
