 Superior rams (108) were distributed to cover 1,640 breedable ewes of the registered farmers for improvement. Marwari sheep Madras Red sheep Network Project on Sheep Improvement (NWPSI): The objective of the project is genetic evaluation and improvement of indigenous sheep breeds through Deccani Sheep LIVESTOCK IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 51 Mandya Sheep Unit, KVAFSU, Bidar: A flock of 487 Mandya sheep including 279 breedable females was built up for production of superior seed stock. Breeding rams (50) were distributed to cover 2,103 breedable ewes. Barbari goats was obtained from second parity and this superiority persists up to sixth parity. The overall mortality and culling was 2.9 and 6.8%, respectively. In Jamunapari goats, the least squares means of body weights of kids at birth, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age during the year were 3.167±0.096, 10.005±0.220, 17.814±0.254, 22.460±0.465 and 27.164±0.901 kg, respectively. The least squares means for body weight under intensive management at 12 months of age was 45.154 kg, and the highest body weight was 52.0 kg. The means for milk yield at 90, 140 days and total milk yield were 80.2, 114.0 and 124.8 kg, respectively. The average lactation length was 179.5 days, which was longer than other Indian breeds. Jamunapari goats were productive until seventh parity. The genetic trend in Jamunapari goats at 9 and 12 months of age was 0.14 kg and 0.19 kg/ year. A positive genetic trend was also observed for milk yield at 90 days, 140 days and total milk yield (TMY). In Jakharana goat, least squares means for body weight at birth, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age were 2.38±0.04, 8.51±0.19, 13.21±0.52, 16.91±1.90 and 24.13±2.23 kg , respectively, during the year. Average lactation milk of Jakharana does was 205.93±11.8 litres during the reported period. Superior Jamunapari (154), Barbari (308) and Jakhrana goats (126) were supplied to farmers during the year. Pig Improved crossbred pig varieties: Faster growing pig varieties, namely Rani and Asha were developed and released. The Rani variety was developed by crossing exotic parental lines of Hampshire (male) with indigenous Ghungroo (female) pigs to produce F1, followed by inter-se mating for five generations to stabilize the heterosis effect whereas, exotic Duroc breed was used as terminal cross for developing Asha. These varieties are expected not only to benefit socio- economically weak communities in terms of their Breeding buck production through multiplier flocks Multiplier flocks of Barbari goats were adopted to popularize scientific goat farming. Various interventions were provided to these flocks for development of livelihood model and agri-business models for breeding and goat production. These flocks were established in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. Majority of these farms are practising stall feeding with optimum feed inputs. All improved management practices (breeding calendar, feeding, housing and health care) were adopted.
