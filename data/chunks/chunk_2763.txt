 a note regarding the so-called proceedings of the meeting on December 10'" 2009 related to BN- Bt variety that were not proceedings. b. A note pointing out that Dr. Kranthi had numerous oppurtunities to indicate that the Bn-Bt that was released has MON-531 event. c. Draft proceedings of the meeting held on 10-12-2009 which was sent by ADG (CC) to members for .comments. This draft is in variance to that released in response to RTI application. d. Proceedings of the meeting on BN-Bt that was conducted by DOG (CS) on 21-5-2008. These proceedings are not in consonance to the events that are described in the "proceedings of Dec. 10'" 2009 meeting" released in response to RTI application. e. A letter dated June 16'" 2011 addressed to DOG (C5) indicating that certain modifications be made to the draft minutes of a meeting held on April 27'", 2011. 3. Earlier draft of Katageri et al manuscript which indicates that I. Altosaar was listed as an author of this paper. 4. An additional note pointing out deficiencies in the proceedings of the Dec. 10'" 2009 meeting. 5. A listing of further work that needs to be done with regard to molecular characterization of the Bn-Bt event. Genome walking in T·DNA part ofBNBt Event (from March 30,2012 to April 18, 2012) - -' InteRration pattern of crylAc-pllinBt3 in cotton Renome in RNBt event Genome walking has been performed in T-DNA starting from the Left and Right borers simultaneously (as indicated by arrows). The complete sequence of RB, Nos-promoter, nptll and nos-terminator are available intact. The sequence from LB, CaMV 35 S promoter, crylAc (1000bp) are available intact. i). Further walking beyond nos-terminator is in progress. ii). Further walking beyond 1000bp ofcrylAc is in progress. Sequence information available so far indicates that the selectable marker gene cassette and crylAc gene cassette (except the uncharted terminator region) as exist in pBinBt 3 seems to have been integrated undisturbed. Further sequencing will indicate if the terminators are intact or deleted or rearranged. - - - Genome walking in T-DNA part of BNBt Event (from March 3D/April 18, 2012 to June 1, 2012) ----[~EE~] .plll ~ a)·IM EEEJ---- -- Integration pattern of crytAc·pBlnBt3 In cotton genome In BNBt event The sequences obtained so far and which were found intact are given below: WALK-I: Primer Sequence: CGCTCACTGCCCGCTTTCCA (pBinl9 6965-6983) >061-IV177_6965-3_SP6-B07.
