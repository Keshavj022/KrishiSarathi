 Improved Varieties: Improved varieties are J S20-116, JS 2034, J S 2098, N R C -86 and other recommend varieties. Bio-fortified Varieties: NRC-127 (First Kunitz Trypsine Inhibitor free variety of India) Seed Rate: For getting optimum population 75- 80 Kg per ha seeds are required. Sowing geometry in clay and clay loam soils row to row 45 cm and plant to plant 15 cm. Sorghum Sowing: Most important fodder crop of kharif season sown on the onset of the monsoon. Improved Varieties: Hybrids: CSH 1,5,6,9,10,11, Varieties: SPV 96, 245, 462, 475, CSV 15, 17, 23, Pratap Jowar 1430, ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 37 Fodder purpose: (i) Multi-cut: MP chari, SSG 59-3, (ii) Single cut: Raj Chari 1, 2, and Pratap Chari 1080 Seed Rate: For grain: 9-10 kg/ ha at for 45 cm line spacing, Fodder varieties: 25-30 kg per ha at 25- 30 cm line spacing Horticulture   In early kharif season sowing of green manuring crop like dhaincha (Sesbania bispinosa) is advised.   Deep ploughing in early kharif season in fallow land for better crop in kharif season is advised.   In papaya nursery raising and planting at RxR 2.5 m and PxP 1.6 m spacing for higher yields is advised.  Citrus: In citrus new planting can be done and in old orchards regular irrigation, weeding and plant protection measures for canker and dieback disease, are to be carried out. For prevention and management of canker and dieback disease pruning of dried twigs followed by immediate spray of copper oxychloride followed by two sprays of straptocyline + copper oxychloride at monthly interval starting from June. FYM (50-60 kg/plant) should be applied in January, and inorganic fertilizers (N: P2O5: K2O @ 900: 250: 500g/plant) should be applied in in two or three equal split doses, the first 15 days before projected blooming, the second after fruit set, and the third shortly after the rainy season has ended (September-October).  Guava: Winter season crop based on June-July flowering pays well in guava. For that, with the onset of monsoon, complete amount of organic manure (60-70 kg FYM/plant/annum), phosphorus (180 g/plant), and potassium (175g/plant), and half of the nitrogen (180g/plant), should be applied in June-July. In October and November, remaining nitrogen (180g/plant) needs to be applied.  Pomegranate: In dry areas, the Mrig bahar crop is commonly harvested. In the month of June, just after the first irrigation of bahar treatment, full doses of FYM @ 40-50 kg/plant), phosphorus (225g/plant), and potassium (200-250g/plant), and half doses of nitrogen (300-350g/plant) should be applied in circular trenches 20-30 cm deep and one m away from main shoots, and the second half dose (300-350g/plant) of nitrogen should be applied after three weeks.  Ber: training and pruning should be done in early May and freshly cut plant parts should be covered with Bordeaux paste followed by deep ploughing in the orchard.
