 It has better tolerance to cold and moisture stress and is moderately resistant to powdery mildew and white rot VL Gehun 804 wheat having high degree of resistance to brown and yellow rusts and loose smut, gives yield 4.13 and 2.57 tonnes/ha under irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) through the Vivekananda Pravatiya Krishi Anusandhan Sansthan (VPKAS), Almora, the ICAR Research Complex for Northern-Eastern Hills Region, Umaim, Meghalaya, and the Central Agricultural Research Institute (CARI), Port Blair, evolves technologies to meet the needs of tribal farmers in hilly areas. These technologies are intended to improve the socio-economic status of the target group, and will help them to acquire special skills through vocational training in traditional and non-traditional crops, agroforestry, apiculture, sericulture, horticulture, animal husbandry, poultry and fisheries. VIVEKANANDA PARVATIYA KRISHI ANUSANDHAN SANSTHAN, ALMORA Crop Improvement Three varieties were released and notified.

The grains are orange-yellow, flint and the plants are slightly shorter (200–205 cm) than Makka 16. It has shown tolerance to Helminthosporium turcicum leaf blight and yielded 4–4.5 tonnes/ha. A tomato variety VLT 9531 was identified with an average yield potential of DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 184 22.27 tonnes/ha (fruit). The yield potential was higher than that of best checks Pusa Ruby and Rupali. Its fruits are round, medium large in size, deep red, thick skinned and free from fruit-cracking. The following promising lines were identified for release in Uttaranchal hills. Two short-duration, blast-resistant strains of rice, viz VL 95-6446 (IET 16480) and VL 96-6747 (IET 16482), were recommended for on-farm trials in hills of Uttaranchal and Himachal Pradesh under rainfed upland conditions. Both the strains had genetically diverse parental lines in their parentage. An exotic line VHC 12 was identified as one of the promising genotypes of capsicum, giving an average yield of 21.94 tonnes/ha compared with best check California Wonder (17.08 tonnes/ha).
