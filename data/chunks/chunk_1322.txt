 Additionally, farmers sold goat kids at prices ranging from `7,000 to 10,000, based on age and sex. Currently, farmers sell around 30 adult goats and 10 kids annually, timing sales with festivals when demand and prices are higher. The total production cost for a herd of about 100 animals, including feed, medical care, and maintenance, is approximately `3,50,000/year. With a Benefit-Cost ratio of 2.57, this profitability enables farmers to support their families comfortably. Successful goat keepers Satisfied with their goat-rearing success, many farmers are eager to expand their production, with some already taking steps to do so. The program also provides advanced training in goat husbandry. Among those excelling in this enterprise is Shri Ajaib Singh (56) from Chatha Nanhera, a former landless labourer seeking additional income sources. Inspired by the FFP potential, he embraced goat rearing. In 2017, under the FFP, Ajaib Singh received five goat kids (four females and one male) to start a small- scale goat farming venture. As part of the program, he also received extensive training in rearing, feeding, and veterinary care. Starting with just five goats, he has now expanded his herd to around 50. Each family member plays a vital role wherein he manages grazing and feeding, his son oversees marketing and health management, and his wife handles milking and general care. The goats graze on village common lands as well as canal-side fields and receive a supplemental mix of maize, gram, soybean, and wheat, ensuring health and productivity. The FFP was pivotal in transforming Ajaib Singh’s life, providing essential training, ongoing support, and expert guidance. This holistic approach, including financial assistance, training, and hands-on support, enabled him to overcome challenges and become a successful goat farmer. Shri Ajaib Singh’s success is a joint effort by his entire family. His son helps with grazing and marketing, while his wife cares for the younger animals, milking, and farm cleanliness. Their teamwork has created an efficient system that ensures smooth farm operations. His story exemplifies how institutional support, hard work, and family dedication can change lives. Today, Shri Ajaib Singh’s thriving goat farming business not only sustains his family but also inspires others in his village and beyond, providing a sustainable income source. Table 2.
