8% over traditional methods. This model generated `92,444 year and provided 353 person-days of employment. Rainfed IFS model for Rajasthan At Jodhpur (Rajasthan), a 2 ha rainfed IFS model incorporated a cropping system that included pearl millet + green gram + dew gram + cluster bean in a 3:1:1:1 ratio along with horticulture (ber), covering 80% of the area and contributing 18% to income. Livestock, including 1 cow and 10 goats/sheep, utilized 20% and contributed 82% to income. Overall, this IFS model achieved a pearl millet equivalent yield of 15 tonnes/ year, generating net returns of `1.32 lakh/year and providing employment for 350 person-days/year. Rainfed IFS model for Jharkhand A rice + fish (mixed carps)-wheat system increased net returns to `58,557/ha compared to the rice-fallow system (`2,770/ha). Another Jharkhand model, which combined fish, pig rearing, and paddy, generated returns of `53,100/ha with a benefit-cost ratio of 4.12, significantly outperforming fish alone in the ponds (`12,125/ha). Rainfed IFS model for Chhattisgarh A mixed farming (crop-livestock) module of 1.5 acre for marginal farmers generated 316 person-days of employment and `33,076 in net income annually, outperforming crop-only systems. Rainfed IFS model for Karnataka A model with 35.4% cereals, 25.7% pulses, 21% oilseeds, 17.3% commercial crops, and 1.2% fodder, supplemented with backyard poultry (6 birds per household), was found to be ideal for small and marginal farmers of Dharwad. In this model, poultry component played a major role in stabilizing the farmers’ income during drought years. In Karnataka’s eastern and central dry zones, rainfed groundnut-based systems generated `5,059/ha with crops alone, rising to `22,000/ha when combined with groundnut + dairy + sheep (8–10). With respect to small and large farmers, the crop + dairy system recorded higher net income, whereas the crop + sheep farming system was more economical for medium farmers. In Chamarajanagar, systems integrating crop + dairy + sheep + poultry + sericulture + fodder yielded net income of `1,15,584/ha, while crop + dairy + sheep + goat systems generated `1,04,078/ha compared to other farming system models under rainfed conditions. Rainfed IFS model for Telangana A cotton + sheep model involving cotton on one ha of arable land and rearing of 10 lambs generated `27,500/ ha, significantly higher than cotton alone (`8,700/ha) at Warangal district of Telangana. Rainfed IFS model for Andhra Pradesh In Anantapur (Andhra Pradesh), the highest returns were achieved with a groundnut (2 ha) + poultry system (`43,360), followed by groundnut + dairy (3 buffalo) (`40,606), with sole crop of groundnut (2.6 ha) generating `14,872/ha.
