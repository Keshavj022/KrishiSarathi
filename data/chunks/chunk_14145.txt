 It also offers intan- gible beneﬁts like enhanced energy autonomy, improved environmental conditions, and an elevated quality of life for communities. GOI introduced the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) in January 2023 to boost domestic energy produc- tion, aiming to reduce energy imports and enhance energy security. With an expected outlay of D197.44 billion from 20232024 to 2029203022, the mission responds to the growing hydrogen demand in India, projected to rise from 5 million tons in 2020 to 30 million tons by 2050 (Vats & Mathur, 2022). Currently, India relies heavily on black and grey hydrogen (produced by burning coal and natural gas, respectively), but green hydrogen, produced through water electrolysis, is poised to revolutionise the country’s decar- bonisation efforts. India’s abundant RE resources and low production costs make it uniquely positioned to transition to a hydrogen-based economy (Raj, Lakhina, & Stranger, 2022). GOI aims to increase green hydrogen production to 5 mil- lion metric tons by 2030 and have it constitute 94% (about 28 million tons) of total hydrogen production by 2050 (Kumar, Jufar, Kumar, Foroozesh, Kumari, & Bera, 2023). 13 https://www.cleanenergyministerial.org/content/uploads/ 2022/05/a-guidebook-on-superefﬁcient-equipment-program-seep. pdf  Accessed on 25 July 2023. 14 https://beeindia.gov.in/en/programmesﬁnancing-energy-efﬁ ciency/energy-efﬁciency-ﬁnancing-platform-eefp  Accessed on 25 July 2023. 15 https://beeindia.gov.in/en/programmesﬁnancing-energy-efﬁ ciency/framework-for-energy-efﬁcient-economic-development- feeed  Accessed on 25 July 2023. 16 https://beeindia.gov.in/en/energy-conservation-building-code- ecbc  Accessed on 27 July 2023. 17 https://www.tndindia.com/budget-2023-power-ministry-outlay- up-58-per-cent  Accessed on 27 July 2023. 18 https://mercomindia.com/discoms-atc-losses-decline-17-fy22- tough-reforms  Accessed on 27 July 2023. 19 https://sdgs.un.org/partnerships/india-plans-produce-175-gw- renewable-energy-2022  Accessed on 02 August 2023. 20 https://m.economictimes.com/industry/renewables/india- misses-re-capacity-target-due-to-low-solar-rooftop-wind-energy- project-installations-parliamentary-panel/articleshow/98870462. cms  Accessed on 02 August 2023. 21 https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india- 250gw-renewable-energy-capacity-plans-ﬁve-years-8539834/  Accessed on 02 August 2023. 22 https://mercomindia.com/discoms-atc-losses-decline-17-fy22- tough-reforms  Accessed on 02 August 2023. 24 H. Saranga et al. This shift can position India as a leader in sustainable energy, generating jobs, and ﬁnancial opportunities. Green hydro- gen offers several advantages, including its synergy with RE production by acting as an energy storage mechanism, solv- ing the issue of intermittent RE generation23, reducing pollu- tion in resource extraction and usage, and serving as feedstock for polluting industries like chemicals, reﬁneries and metallurgy.
