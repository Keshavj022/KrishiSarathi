 Production Technologies: • Foliar application of 2% urea/DAP at the time of flowering and 10 days there after significantly increased the grain yield of chickpea. • Use of 2 ton of vermi‐compost significantly improved the grain yield of chickpea (NWPZ, CZ and SZ). • In bold seeded Kabuli chickpea, application of 60 kg P20s/ha was recommended when available P was less than 15 kg/ha in the soil. • Rice‐chickpea (Kabuli) system is gaining popularity because of higher economic returns as compared to Rice‐ wheat system. • For bold seeded Kabuli, 100kg seed/ha proved beneficial to obtain higher grain yield. • Sowing of two rows at 30 cm apart on 67.5 cm wide raised beds proved highly productive than the flat bed sowing in heavy soils. www.icar.org.in 29 2002 ‐ 2007 • Combined application of biofertilizers consisting of Rhizobium + PSB + Trichoderma, Pseudomonas + PGPR and Vitavax was more beneficial as compared to inoculation with Rhizobium only. • Highly efficient Rhizobium strains G567 SMR and GHUR 15 were recommended for commercialization. • Micronutrient application of Molybdenum, Iron, Boron and Zinc enhanced the nitrogen fixation and resulted higher grain yields. • Delivery of Rhizobium + PSB biofertilizers in a single packet is feasible in Alginate (2%) beads with self life up to 510 days. • For drought tolerance the donor identified was Phule G 96006 where as donors for cold tolerance were PDG 84 16 and Phule G 96006. • Higher total dry matter production with more partitioning into the economic sink, lower SLA or higher SLW particularly at podding stage, more number of effective nodes per plant and deep rooting system are recorded as important traits for higher grain yield under moisture stress. 3 c. Protection Technologies: • Eco friendly management of Wilt and Dry Root Rot (DRR) in chickpea was evolved and validation of the technology was done: ‐ Wilt Resistant varieties such as JG315, Vijay, Vishal, KWR108, HC1 and GG1 were identified. ‐ Seed treatment with 4 g of Trichoderma + 1 g of Vitavax per kg of seed was recommended • Deep summer ploughing was suggested to control soil born pathogen. • Two insecticides ‐ Betacyfluthrin 18.75 g ailha and Koranda showed superiority over endosulphan in controlling H. armigera. • Among newer insecticides, Novaluron 10 EC 100 g and Proclaim 5 SC, 11 g gave 78.3% and 71.9% reduction in pod damage over control, respectively. • Intercropping of chickpea having normal planting protected with NSKE‐NPV and Profenofos was found comparable to 3 sprays of Profenofos for management of H. armigera. • Seed treatment with Carbosulfan 25ST 3% was found effective in reducing 40% Root Knot nematode population.
