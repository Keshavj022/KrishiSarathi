 The mutant lines showing enhanced tolerance to important biotic stresses (YSB, ShB and BLB) as well as several economically important traits are unique genetic resources which can be utilized for the identification of novel genes/ alleles for different traits. The lines which have better agronomic features can be used as pre-breeding lines. The entire mutant population is maintained as a national resource for genetic improvement of the rice crop (https://journals.plos.org/plosonearticle?id=10.1371/ journal.pone.0258816). Detection of multiple abiotic stress responsive genes using transcriptomics in sugarcane: Among multiple abiotic stresses, drought caused maximum reduction in growth parameters and impacted the physiological parameters adversely while waterlogging led to maximum increase in catalase and peroxidase activities. Transcriptomic analysis database revealed 94,037, 94,226, 93,530 and 94,005 transcripts under control, drought, salinity and waterlogging treatments, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted using total RNA as starting material from sugarcane leaf samples of CoS 767 at the end of stress. Database summary revealed that 66,595 transcripts were annotated by Refseq database, 21,216 transcripts were annotated by Uniprot and 32,805 transcripts were annotated by PFAM database. Results depicted a total number of 94,037, 94,226, 93,530 and 94,005 transcripts under control, drought, salinity and waterlogging treatments, respectively. Differential expression analysis revealed 177, 690 and 500 significantly up-regulated transcripts under drought salinity and waterlogging conditions. Whereas, 1,961, 2,074 and 2,008 genes were found significantly down-regulated under drought salinity and waterlogging treatments, respectively. Waterlogging responsive genes using transcriptomics in sugarcane: Four genotypes under waterlogging indicated changes in photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll a and b, total Chl, carotenoids, Chl a/b, total Chl /CAR and SPAD index. Twenty four genotypes under waterlogging showed wide variation in Brixo, Sucrose% juice and juice purity. Under water- logging conditions, 447,196 transcripts were identified with an average length of 509 bp (N50=621) for the de novo assembly of 29,6518 unigenes with an average length of 529 bp (N50=664). The construction of cellulase cocktail enabled efficient hydrolysis pre- treated SCT. The total number of genes with differential expression were 69,365, 62,339, 70,352, 63,609 in control vs waterlogging (CoLk 94,184), CoLk 94,184 vs CoJ 64 (control), CoLk 94,184 vs CoJ 64 (waterlogging) and control vs waterlogging (CoJ 64), respectively. Chromosome level reference assembly of Indian tea genome: The genome size of an Indian tea (Camellia assamica var. Masters cv. TV1) was determined as 3.0 Gb using a FACS cell sorting facility. A chromosome-level reference genome assembly (2.93 Gb; 97.66% Coverage) was generated anchoring 99.
