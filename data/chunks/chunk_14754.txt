 The challenge of agriculture is to balance the food production required to support the current and expanding population against environmental protection and the provision of other ecosystem services (Falkenmark et al., 2007). Best management practices can mitigate contaminant losses and impacts; however, sufficient time and investment are required to allow them to have full effect on waterbodies. Knowledge gaps • What mitigation measures will be most effective for individual pollutants, watercourses, and landscape scenarios? • What are the trade-offs between agricultural production, the delivery of other ecosystem services, and pollution and abstraction of water? • How will changing agricultural practices and demands impact on water bodies? • What are the time frames by which improvement in water quality can be expected subsequent to interventions? • How can water use efficiency be improved for various livestock and crop systems? • How should the costs of water quality and the delivery of water-related ecosystem services be reflected in food and fiber prices? • How do we achieve a balance between the positive (e.g., food production) and negative impacts (e.g., pressures on waterbodies) of agriculture?
