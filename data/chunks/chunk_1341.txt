 Over time, demand for these birds has increased because they provide better returns under similar rearing practices. Improved management, suitable housing, ventilation, feed supplementation, and periodic health monitoring can further increase their production potential. Based on farmers' feedback, the economics of raising 25 birds (a model unit of backyard poultry, assuming at least 10 females complete laying and 10 males reach marketable age) is calculated. Considering an average mortality rate of 15%, an average selling price of males at 200 `/kg, and an egg selling price of 10 rupees per egg with an average egg production of 130-140 eggs/bird/ year. The cost of rearing and labour has been considered negligible for both stocks, but for Himsamridhi birds, an Table 1.

Establishment of poultry units in FFP area Recognizing the economic importance of backyard poultry for rural farmers, a total of 900 Himsamridhi breed poultry chicks were supplied, and 18 units, each containing 50 birds, were established in the area. Farmers were trained in the scientific upkeep of poultry and the management of various diseases affecting the birds. Within the first year of establishment, the average net return from each unit was `5,750, generated through the sale of 425 eggs at `10/egg and the sale of male Table 3.
