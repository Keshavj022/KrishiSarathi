 Seed conservation: (a) Low-temperature storage of orthodox seeds (seed genebank), (b) Cryopreservation: storage of orthodox, intermediate and recalcitrant (embryonic axis) seeds 67 in liquid nitrogen which has temperature -150 to -196 oC. The details of the present status of conservation of plant genetic resources at the National Genebank located in New Delhi is provided in Table 4. Table 4.

Such conservation is based on the slowed growth of cultures in highly controlled in-vitro conditions. In-vitro conservation strategies can be technically divided into two categories (1) In vitro active genebank (IVAG) or tissue culture repository and (2) In vitro base genebank (IVBG) or cryobank. The former genebank is for short to medium-term storage of germplasm using shoot cultures or plantlets under slow or normal growth procedures, but the cultures are maintained under the growing state. While cryobank is meant for the long-term conservation PGR, usually using embryos (somatic or zygotic), shoot tips and pollen under suspended growth. Cryopreservation: conservation of cultures (tissues, organs, pollen, cultures, or seed in liquid nitrogen at -150 to -196 oC. The status of germplasm conserved under the in-vitro bank and cryo bank at ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi is provided in Table 5.

It is particularly required for forestry species, species belonging to a complex ecosystems, endangered, and wild relatives of crop plants.
