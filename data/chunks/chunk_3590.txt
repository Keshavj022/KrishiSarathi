 However, along the open interspaces and surrounding areas Indian Horticulture 8 pre-emergence sprays of bromacil 2.5 kg or diuron 3 kg in 600 litre water per hectare or post-emergence sprays of glyphosate (0.8 kg/ha) have been found effective. Precautions are to be taken to avoid direct contact of these sprays with the pineapple plants. Foliar feeding: Pineapple plants under weed mat mulching are fed by foliar sprays of nutrient mixtures from the second year as basal dressing by removing weed mat is difficult in dense plantations. Foliar feeding of NPK (19:19:19) as sprays at 7th or 8th months after planting, and again at 30 after fruit set facilitates better leaf and fruit growth. Micronutrient sprays especially Zn (0.4%) + B (0.1%) at 40 and 50 days after fruit set improve fruit weight and quality. Flower regulation: Flower regulation is also possible under the weed mat technology. Solution of 6.5-10ml of ethrel+ 2kg urea+ 40g sodium carbonate in 100 L water is prepared for 2000 plants @ 50 ml/plant poured at the central core of the plant during evening time at 35-40 leaf stage of the plant. Flowering initiates within 30-40 days and fruits mature within 130-140 days. Harvesting and Quality: Fruits are ready to harvest during mid May to mid July (var. Queen) and the last week of July to the first week of September (var. Kew). Fruit yield ranged from 55.0-60.0 T/ha (var. Queen) to 65.0-70.0 T/ha (var. Kew). Fruit weight ranged from 1.5-2.0 kg (var. queen) to 2.0-2.5 kg (var. Kew) and TSS ranged from 16.5-19.5 0B (var. Queen) to 14.5-17.5 0B (var. Kew). Harvesting at green eyes with no yellow colour (CS1) and 5-20% of eyes turn yellow (CS2) is suitable for long-distance marketing, whereas, 20- 50% of eyes turn yellow. (CS3 & CS4) sui appropriate for medium distance marketing; and >50-80% of eyes turn yellow (CS4 & CS5) appropriate for local market. However, 90-100% of eyes turn reddish brown (CS6) and are consumed without storage. Plant protection: Integrated pest management for insects such as mealy bug, termites, weevils and scale is done by spraying chlorpyriphos/ imidacloprid/dimethoate/fenitrothion (1ml/L water). Followed by sprays of mancozeb (2-3g/L water) for heart rot and fruit rot. Heart rot is caused by Phytopthora spp. heart leaves base turn yellow and then brown water soaked which can be easily pooled out. Phytopthora root rot causes rotting of roots and leaf tip and margins to turn necrotic and drenching as well as a spray with ridomil/metalyxil is effective. Broad spectrum fungicide composition of Azoxystrobin 18.2% + Difenoconazole 11.4% SC or Metiram 55 % + Pyraclostrobin 5 % WG is recommended for control of diseases. Advantage of the system 1. Weed free cultivation system which saves 25-30% of the cost. 2. Conserves sufficient soil moisture and also allows water to penetrate the soil through the micro pores of the at sheet. 3. Protects soil erosion under heavy rainfall conditions and sloppy and hilly lands. 4.
