 (2017), who showed that directly trained contact farmers saw a larger impact on adop- tion behavior than other farmers. Moreover, the coefﬁcient a3 Col- umn 3 is insigniﬁcant, suggesting a similar trend across network beneﬁciaries and non-beneﬁciaries in the absence of frontline demonstration interventions. Table 8 presents the impact of capacity-building programs on the adoption of HD-2967 by network beneﬁciaries. Columns 1 and 2 present the impact estimates for network beneﬁciaries with and without a time-varying district control. In Column 1, the coef- ﬁcient a1 represents a 24 % increase in adoption of HD-2967 between 2015 and 16 and 2017–18. The estimated coefﬁcient a2 is insigniﬁcant and reveals that the adoption pattern of network beneﬁciaries of capacity-building programs is similar to those of non-beneﬁciaries (before such program interventions). The coefﬁ- cient of interest, a3; reveals that network beneﬁciaries’ adoption rate is about 10.6 % higher than that of non-beneﬁciaries. When we include a time-varying district control in Column 2, the coefﬁ- cient a3 is marginally higher (10.8 % versus 10.6 %) than in Column 1, which suggests that the estimates are not upward-biased. Again, the magnitude of increased adoption is smaller than that of pri- mary beneﬁciaries of capacity-building programs. The above results are robust to pre-intervention trends in Column 3. This study establishes evidence of a positive impact of frontline demon- strations and capacity-building programs on network beneﬁciaries’ adoption of wheat variety HD-2967. 5.4. District-level trends in adoption of HD-2967 This section examines the association of frontline demonstra- tions with district-level adoption of HD-2967.35 Fig. 6 summarizes information on the implementation of such demonstrations for HD- 2967 at the district level from 2012 to 2017. Based on this informa- tion, we classify districts into ﬁve categories: i) districts where no frontline demonstrations were conducted in the years between 2012 and 2017 (Agra, Etawah, Jaunpur, and Raebareli), referred to Table 7 Estimates of FLDs on network beneﬁciaries’ adoption of HD-2967, new wheat variety, Uttar Pradesh.

The dependent variable takes a value of 1 when wheat farmers adopt HD-2967 and 0 otherwise. Time is a dummy variable. In Models 1 and 2, it takes value 1 for 2017–18 and 0 for 2015–16. Model 3 takes a value of 1 for 2015–16 and 0 for 2014–15. In all models, the treatment group is deﬁned as network beneﬁciaries.
