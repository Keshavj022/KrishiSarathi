 Once seeds are produced the sales and marketing departments then ensure that the seeds reach the market. The vegetable seed industry has given tremendous boost not only to employment but also to increased yields that ensured better income to our farmers. Let us look forward to bigger innovations in future hand in hand with the public sector.

Climate change will have an impact on the intensity of environmental stress imposed on vegetable crops, and rising temperatures, decreased irrigation water supply, and floods will be important limiting factors in maintaining and expanding vegetable production. Development of varieties, technologies and intervention of biotechnology approaches are the options to meet the challenges due to changing climatic scenario. Prospects N Rai*, Anant Bahadur, P M Singh, Ram Krishna, Anish Kumar Singh, Lokesh Kumar Mishra, Sudhir Kumar, Achuit K Singh and T K Behera L ast three decades, vegetable output has risen globally, surpassing grain production in terms of value of global commerce. The main factor behind agricultural losses globally is environmental stress, which reduces major crop yields by more than 50%. The environment that vegetables are produced in varies tremendously depending on the season and the location. Plants may use morphological or biochemical strategies to react similarly to avoid one or more stresses. For the production of tropical vegetables to be sustainable, adaptation measures are essential. The current cultivation of vegetables faces major obstacles and harmful effects from climate change. These obstacles and issues with vegetable crops are given below.
