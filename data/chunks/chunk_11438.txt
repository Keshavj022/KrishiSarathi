 One or two weeding 30 to 60 days after sowing are enough. Weedicide like fluchoralin 45 EC 2 lit/ha or imazethapyr 400-600 ml, in 800-1000 litre of water or alachlor 50 EC @ 2 lit/ha should be sprayed at the time of final planking or 1 or 2 days after sowing. Plant Protection insect Pest: Not many insects damage lentil crop. Hairy cater pillar, semi-looper and pod borer do some damage. Hair caterpillar and semi lopper can be controlled by spraying dimethoate 30EC @ 2 ml/ litre water, for the control of pod borer, spray spinosad 45 SC 0.5 ml/ litre. To control termite in lentil crop spray chlorpyriphos 20 EC @ 4ml/litre water. Mustard Soil: Light to heavy soil is good for mustard and rapeseed cultivation. Rai can be grown in all type of soil, whereas loam to heavy soil is suitable for toria crop. Improved varieties: Toria: PT203; Panchali; PB737 Mustard: Pusa Mustard 25; Pusa Mustard 28; Pusa Mustard 30; NRCHB 101; Siwani T59 (Varuna); Pusa Agrani. Optimum sowing time: optimum time for sowing of mustard crop is 15 Oct. to 15 Nov and Toria crop complete sowing time 15 Sept. to 15 Oct. when rapeseed – mustard grown as intercrop, time of sowing a depend upon cultivation of main crop. Spacing: for rapeseed mustard keep row to row distance of 30 cm while plant to plant distance of 10-15 cm, seeds are sown at depth of 2 cm. Seed Requirement: when rapeseed mustard is grown individually then it requires seed rate of 3.75kg per ha but general recommendation is 5Kg/ha. Do thinning operations three week after sowing and maintain only healthy seeding. To protect seed from seed borne disease before sowing do seed treatment with thiram @ 3g per kg of seeds. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 193 Application of FYM & Fertilizer: while preparing field, apply 50 to 100q FYM or well decomposed compost in soil. Application of fertilizer for Toria as 50:25:25:20 Kg/ha (NPKs) and for Rapeseed –Mustard as 80:60:40:20 Kg/ha (NPKS) on soil test value basis. Weed management: To control weeds take two to three weeding and or 2 hoeing at interval of two weeks when intensity of weed is low. To control weed in Rapeseed & Mustard crop, do pre-plant incorporation of Trifluralin @ 1000 ml/500 liter of water per ha., give pre-emergence spray of isoproturon @ 100g/500 liter within 2 days of sowing. Irrigation: Give pre sowing irrigation before sowing of seeds for good growth, crop required in general about three irrigations apply at interval of three weeks after sowing. Apply good quantity of organic manures in soil, it will help to conserved moisture in soil. Plant Protection: Aphids suck the sap and plant get weak pale and plant remain stunted and in later stage do not bear pods. To manage, do timely sowing of crop. Avoid excessive use of Nitrogenous fertilizer, when infection is observed in field, take spray of thiamethoxam @ 80 g or imidacloprid 17.8 SL 0.3ml/ litre. White pustules of white rust are observed on leaves, stem and on flowers.
