Fig. 1. Application of parso leaves in rice field to control paddy gallfly RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Results obtained through PRA are presented in Table 1. The matrix scoring reveals that use of parso leaves is more efficacious than use of chemical insecticides in controlling allflies. Parso leaves had also advantage over the use of chemical pesticides on the other parameters studied. Experiment Results obtained through field experimentation are presented in Table 2. When the crop was not given any treatment, (in the control plot), the percentage of infestation of gall midge (% of the PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT  silver shoot) increased from 6% at 30 days after transplanting (30 DAT) to 9.8% at 60 DAT. In the parso leaf application, the intensity of infestation was reduced from 3.2% at 30 DAT to 2.1% at 45 DAT and finally to 2.0% at 60 DAT. In carbofuran application, the percentage of infestation was reduced from 4% at 30 DAT to 2.0% at 60 DAT. CONCLUSION It was concluded that the ITK using parso leaves to control rice gallfly is quite effective and almost at par with the recommended practice of using carbofuran 3G. PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT Code : 344 Title of the ITK : Management of yellow stem borer in paddy by use of parasi (Cleistanthus collinus) leaf Description of the ITK : Application of 75-150 kg parasi (Cleistanthus collinus) leaves by broadcasting once in the rice field at 3 days after transplanting controls yellow stem borer during kharif. All the rice-growing farmers in the Aralkocha village of Purulia district in West Bengal follow this practice for the last 50 years. Paddy is the main crop in this area in kharif. Other than paddy, blackgram, greengram, redgram, niger, mustard, groundnut, tomato, brinjal, cowpea and bhindi are also grown in this area. Yellow stem-borer (attacking in all the growth stages, except flowering and onward stage) of paddy is the most important and major pest problem in lowland cultivation of paddy. The larva enters the stem and feeds upon the internal plant material, thereby disrupting the vascular passage to the terminal portion (which may be leaf or panicle). It results on drying of the portion, causing the symptoms (dead-heart at the vegetative stage and white ear in the mature stage).
