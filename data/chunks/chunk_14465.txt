Groundwater level and NVSWI Spatio-temporal variations in groundwater level during the pre and post monsoon season are shown in Figs. 11 and 12, respectively. The figures show that groundwater level remained 15.0 m below ground level (m bgl) in major part of ACZ I, II, and III from 2001 to 2007. Since 2007, there has been a noticeable decline in groundwater levels, and the maximum decline was observed in the central part of the study area, i.e., ACZ II. The deepest groundwater level (>35.0 m bgl) was found in the southern part of Haryana (ACZ I) from the year 2002 onwards, and the area falling into this category has grown since then. The central part of ACZ II experienced the greatest groundwater decline from 2001 and 2020. Groundwater levels in the majority of its (ACZ II) area declined from 15.0 m bgl in 2001 to 35.0–40.0 m bgl in 2019–20. In some places, the groundwater became deeper than 40.0 m bgl. Central part of ACZ III also witnessed the groundwater level situation similar to ACZ II. Ac­ cording to Rodell et al. (2009) and Asoka et al. (2018), groundwater level decline in western Indo-Gangetic plains was primarily caused by pumping and long-term declines in monsoonal precipitation. Therefore, low groundwater recharging and increased groundwater withdrawal for irrigation purposes resulted in groundwater decline in major parts of ACZ II and III of Punjab and Haryana. Further, moderate positive and insignificant correlation between SPI and NVSWI instigated a need to further investigate the role of surface Fig. 10.

L. Kaur et al. Agricultural Water Management 274 (2022) 107956 15 and ground water in wheat production in the study area. The ACZs were state-wise divided to know the relationships between mean groundwater level (April) and mean NVSWI values from the 2001-02 to 2019-20 (Fig. 13). In 2002, the mean groundwater level in ACZ I of Punjab was 5 m bgl which reached at 10 m bgl in 2020 [Fig. 13 (b)] while in Har­ yana it was 12.4 m bgl in the year 2002 and it touched 17 m bgl during 2020 [Fig. 13 (d)]. Although, this zone is suffering from the problem of water logging and salinity and most of its area is under canal irrigation in both the states, but intensive agricultural practices have proliferated the use of deeper groundwater to irrigate the fields. The groundwater level and NVSWI had a correlation coefficient of −0.864 and −0.
