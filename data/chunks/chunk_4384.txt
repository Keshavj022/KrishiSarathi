The sustainability of production is well addressed in this system through efficient utilization of natural resources and biomass recycling. The Agri-horti system including horti-pasture besides post-harvest processing and value addition of banana provided net returns of ₨ 39868 which is 22% of the net income of the model. The integration of banana system provided 8.07 kg N, 1.64 kg P and 18.12 kg K which is 6.74% for N, 4.88% for P and 16.48% for K of the total recycling done in the farming system model. This prevents an ultimate loss of huge amount of untapped biomass and environmental issues. It is important that all available by-products be turned into highly commercial outputs in order to sustain this renewable resource and provide additional income. Generating wealth from waste such as from the banana by-products should be regarded as one of the ways to create an eco-friendly environment for the sustainable farming systems.

Net income of model was ₨ 3.87 lakh/year along with 628 man days engaged throughout the years. The highest net income (₨ 1.68 lakh/year) was obtained from livestock (3 crossbreed cows) enterprise followed by crop (₨ 1.06 lakh). Model depicted that the total carbon assimilation by the crop enterprises was 4,448 kg/annum. Carbon cycle assessed using farm design tool showed that total input of carbon from the crop enterprises to household and animal was 603 and 5,555 kg/annum respectively. The addition of carbon from crop and livestock manure to the soil was 256 and 1,698 kg/annum respectively. Overall accumulation of carbon in the soil was 1,955 kg per annum which ultimately enriches the organic matter pool of the soil.

The plant can be multiplied using seeds and cuttings, although seed propagation is easy. Flowering begins 6-8 months after the planting. After 9 to 12 months, the tree will begin to yield fruit.
