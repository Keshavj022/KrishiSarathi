 Rice systems such as alternative wetting and drying (AWD) system, bed planting, aerobic culture, system of rice intensification (SRI) and ground-cover rice production system (GCRPS) could be effective in this regard. For example, the water productivity in aerobic rice is ranged from 0.45 - 0.55 g grain/litre of applied water as compared to 0.25-0.30 g grain/litre of applied water in conventional system. Aerobic rice is high yielding rice grown under non- flooded conditions in nonpuddled and unsaturated (aerobic) soil. It is responsive to high inputs, can be rainfed or irrigated, and tolerates occasional flooding also.   Relay/paira cropping/No till planting of lentil and mustard following kharif rice. By following these techniques, cropping intensity can be doubled in the lands which are kept fallow after kharif rice. Crop Improvement and Production: Crop varieties: Technological options need to be prioritized and popularized to enhance the rice productivity in jhums from the present level of 1050kg/ha. Two popular varieties developed by the institute viz. “Tripura Hakuchuk 1” and “Tripura Hakuchuk 2”, demonstrated a yield of 2800 -3200 kg/ha. Rice productivity in these areas can be doubled by popularization, adoption and replacement of traditional land races in the jhums. One the other hand, popularization of a sesame variety “Tripura Siping” with a high productivity (1100-1300 kg/ha; market value of Rs. 90,000/-) for large scale cultivation can help to increase the farmers’ income as it can be used as a cash crop, particularly in post Kharif/pre Rabi cultivation. Cultivation of long duration pigeon pea alone or intercropped with pineapple can be another remunerative activity under these type of land configuration. Mixed cropping of maize, rice, pigeon pea, tuber crops etc. will not only ensure the sustainable food production but will also help in boosting profitability by higher economic returns to farmers. Fallow land: Area available for diversification in Tripura: Tripura has a total area about 143933 ha fallow, out of which 84341 ha Pre Kharif Fallow (April-June) and 59592 ha rabi Fallow (Dec- March), which provide a wide window for introduction of large number of crops in Tripura. 561 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Table.
