 By targeting traits of interest, HTP can reveal correlations between phenotypes and genetic markers, pinpointing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) or genes. Conventional phenotypic characterization methods, being manual and subjective, fall short in robustness, repeatability, and reliability over time. This 'phenotyping bottleneck' hinders understanding of phenotype-genotype correlations and environmental interactions. High- throughput phenotyping (HTP) typically involves capturing images to quantify traits throughout the crop growth cycle. A major advancement in high-throughput phenotyping is the ability to non-destructively capture plant traits, enabling time-series measurements to track growth and stress over time in individual plants. High-throughput image-based phenotyping refers to technologies that can image at least hundreds of plants each day. This scale enables the analysis of mutant populations, QTL detection, and the identification of gene- environment interactions. Thus, modern high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) is at the forefront of innovation, enabling automated extraction of phenotypic data from sensor inputs. These advancements leverage data analytics, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL), offering a transformative approach for long-term genetic gains in crops. HTP significantly enhances selection accuracy and intensity, making it pivotal in advancing plant science. Integrating high-dimensional HTP sensor data from advanced devices—such as RGB, near-infrared (NIR), infrared (IR), fluorescent, and hyperspectral cameras— with a systems biology, multi-omics approach holds significant potential to enhance crop resilience to climate challenges. In HTP, establishing efficient pipelines converts large volumes of image and sensor data into actionable insights through advanced data analysis and modeling, expediting the selection of crop varieties better suited for climate resilience. Addressing big data and image processing challenges is essential, as accurate phenotyping is critical for breeders aiming to rapidly develop improved crop varieties. This highlights the importance of adopting cutting-edge tools like computer vision, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). Horticultural crops, primarily consumed fresh, are highly perishable due to their high water content, as seen in fruits and vegetables. The market value of these products relies heavily on both external (colour, shape, size, texture) and internal (soluble solid content, firmness) quality attributes, which evolve throughout maturity, ripening, and postharvest storage, necessitating regular monitoring. Currently, external quality is assessed through visual inspection, a slow and subjective process, while internal quality is measured using destructive lab tests or portable tools, which limit speed and sample size.
