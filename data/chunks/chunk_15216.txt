 A graphical representation of the basic model for the welfare effects/impacts in a closed economy is provided in Figure A2. In the ﬁgure, D represents the demand for a homogeneous product, and S represents the supply curve of the product. The initial equilibrium price and quantity are P and Q, respectively. Then, the triangle PeD represents the total consumer surplus, the difference between the willingness to pay of the consumer for a product without forgoing it and what she pays in exchange for the product. The triangle OeP denotes the total producer surplus, the difference between what a producer receives after selling the product in the market and her willingness to sell the same product at a particular price [60,61]. Hence, the triangle OeD represents the total economic surplus accrued to the society. The three different excesses (producer surplus, consumer surplus and economic surplus) are sensitive to changes in demand or supply elasticity. We assumed a closed economy model with a parallel supply shift for organic farming, as shown in Figure A3. Figure A2. Concept of economic surplus. Source: Adopted from [61]. Closed Economy with Parallel Supply Shift Alston showed that a closed economy with a parallel supply shift with the improved technology [60]. The annual changes in total economic surplus (∆TS) can be measured as: ∆CS = P0Q0Z (1 + 0.5Zη) ∆PS = P0Q0 (K −Z) (1 + 0.5Zη) where P0 = Base price of the commodity, Q0 = base quantity, η = absolute value of the price elasticity of demand, ε = elasticity of supply, Z = K ε/(ε + η) is the reduction in price relative to its initial value due to a supply shift.
