 The integrated farming practices in India began with the advent of the global sustainability wave however; the system has still not been implemented as extensively as it should have. Another factor that the concept of modern agriculture failed to incorporate was the shrinking size of farmlands and inability of greater investment in agriculture technologies by farmers. This too posed a great challenge for the agriculture sector as a whole and one that to this day continues to have major impacts on development and financial yields of developing countries around the globe, which can be attributed to the long time it took for sustainability to imbue into agriculture. It holds especially true for a country like India where a vast diversity of farmers practice subsistence agriculture with profits barely enough to satisfy their personal needs which makes financial gains from agriculture a long shot for these small, marginal farmers. With an increase in global food demand and an even disconcerting increase in share of agricultural waste and equivalently resulting pernicious consequences in the form of greenhouse gas emissions from burning of stubble and similar inimical practices-embroils the cultivators in dilemma of personal, financial gain or sustainability which makes directing their limited Indian Farming 41 September 2023 resources towards a wise choice more important than ever. The alternative in such dire circumstances, remains vertical expansion achievable only by the means of integrated farming system, which amalgamates basics of ecology with biological components of agricultural ecosystems to meet the diversified needs of farming community through efficient use of farm resources without degrading the natural resource base and environmental quality. The concept has its origins in the 1987 where Clive A Edwards defined sustainable agriculture by integrated systems of agricultural production, with minimum dependence upon high inputs of energy, in the form of synthetic chemicals and cultivation that substitute cultural and biological techniques for these inputs. It should maintain, or only slightly decrease, overall productivity and maintain or increase the net income for the farmer on a sustainable basis, protecting the environment in terms of soil and food contamination, maintain ecological diversity and the long-term structure, fertility, and productivity of soils. The definition of integrated farming system (IFS) has been subject to constant change depending on the context, varying in their action of synergies among components as can be seen from Okiboâ€™s (1995) definition of a mixed farming system consisting of at least two separate but logically interdependent parts of a crop and livestock enterprises studies which have interpreted it as a component of farming systems which focuses on increasing production whilst minimizing risk, simultaneously increasing profits and improving the utilization of organic wastes and crop residues.
