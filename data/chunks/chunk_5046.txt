 Habitat It grows below 1,500 m above sea level along riversides and roadsides of hotwarm and low altitude regions in sandy and gravel grounds.Commonly found growing in countries like Tibet, India etc. Grows in dry soil throughout tropical parts of India.

Experiment There was three treatment used as follows: T1 as per ITK: FYM at the rate of 25 tonnes/ha was applied along with Cassia application. Cassia leaves (75 kg/ha) with cowdung (125 kg/ha) was  HORTICULTURAL CROPS  made to decompose for 15 days. This compost was then applied to the treatment at the bulb formation stage. T2: Cultivation with recommended practice— FYM 25 t/ha with addition of NPK/ha @ 125:50:25 kg. T3: Cultivation as per farmers practice—FYM @ 25 tonnes/ha only. Each treatment was followed in rainy (kharif) and winter (rabi) seasons with seven replications. Observations were taken on plant height, number of leaves, leaf area, dry matter production and Table 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Experiment Rainy season highest bulb yield of onion ( 339 t/ha) was recorded by following the recommended practice (T 2). The ITK practice (T 1) gave a yield of 337 t/ha which was 332 tonnes/ha by applying FYM (T3). However these treatments did not differ significantly among themselves. Similarly, other parameters studied namely plant height and number of leaves at 45 days after transplanting, mean bulb weight and bulb girth also did not differ significantly among the treatments ( Table 1 ). Visual observation on colour of the bulb also observed to be similar in all the treatments. Rabi season trial: 2002–03: Plant height, number of leaves, leaf area per plant and dry leaf weight recorded at 40 and 70 days after transplanting showed that fertilized plot (T2 : RDF + FYM) head significantly higher values of these parameters as compared to ITK (T1 ) and farmers practice (T 3) (Table 2). The difference may be because of higher nutrients available in the fertilized plot.
