 It is extensively utilized in the floral industry, both as cut flowers and as potted plants. The paper discusses the protected cultivation technology of lilium for commercial purpose. T HE genus Lilium is a member of the Liliaceae family. Extensively employed in the floral industry, it is commonly used as both cut-flowers and potted plants. Lilium species are categorized into three principal groups crucial for commercial cut-flower cultivation: Asiatic hybrids, LA hybrids and Oriental hybrids. These varieties are marketed almost year-round. Climatic conditions, growing methods and post-harvest technologies are very crucial for superior flower quality and the bulb production of the lilies under hills and Northern plains conditions. Lilium is a precious, non-traditional flower crop that is regarded as the king of flower bulbs. The genus Lilium contains about 100 species, 7 parts and 10,000 known cultivars. Lilium is a flowering plant that is often referred to as a ‘lily’ and its shape, elegance and colour of the bloom are all very beautiful and appealing. It is one of the utmost common bulbous ornamental plants and ranks fourth amongst the world’s top ten cut flowers. Lilium belongs to the sub-row of Liliaceae and it is a winter bulb that grows 35 to 200 cm tall. Lilium cultivation in shade-net-house Commercial floriculture has demonstrated a higher potential per unit area compared to other field crops, rendering it a profitable industry. The liberalization of industrial and trade policies has paved the way for the expansion of cut flower exports. Considering the continuously growing demand for cut flowers, potted plants and planting materials, there is a need for a reconciliatory mechanism that considers the interests of both participants in flower and ornamental plant markets. The upsurge in flower production in India can be attributed to the adoption of modern farming technology, enhanced varieties/hybrids, improved cultural practices, and upgraded storage facilities. These factors collectively minimize crop losses stemming from both biotic and abiotic factors, ultimately yielding high- quality produce. Maintenance: For the greenhouse, a variety of types, often hybrids, are grown. They are grouped into the following diverse classes M K Singh and Devarai Lava Kumar Technology Lilium cultivation in shade net house March–April 2024 27 based on the species and the interspecific hybrids from which they were derived. Asiatic hybrids (Division-I), Martagon hybrids (Division-II), Candidum (Euro- Caucasian) hybrids (Division-III), American hybrids (Division-IV), Longiflorum hybrids (Division-V), Trumpet lilies (Division-VI), Oriental hybrids (Division-VII), Other hybrids (Division-VIII) and true species (Division-IX). Because of its high selling value in agriculture and greenhouses, the genus Lilium is very popular as potted plants and cut flowers.
