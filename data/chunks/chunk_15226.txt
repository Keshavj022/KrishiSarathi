Journal of Sensors 3 allowing farmers to access real-time data from smartphones or computers. Automation and remote control of irrigation sys- tems and other equipment streamline farm operations and improve overall efﬁciency. By promoting precision resource management, smart sensors contribute to environmental sustainability [8]. Reduced chemical use, water conserva- tion, and improved soil health are essential elements of sustainable agriculture practices. Precision farming through smart sensor technologies leads to increased productivity and proﬁtability. Optimized resource use, reduced input costs, and higher yields contribute to the economic viability of agricultural operations. These smart sensors are designed to monitor speciﬁc parameters related to soil health, crop conditions, and envi- ronmental factors. The key types of smart sensors used in precision agriculture include: Soil sensors: A soil sensor, referred to as a soil moisture sensor or meter, is a device created to gauge the moisture content in soil. It plays a crucial role in modern agriculture, horticulture, and environmental monitoring, helping to opti- mize irrigation practices and conserve water resources. The sensor offers immediate information concerning the mois- ture content in the soil, allowing farmers, gardeners, and researchers to make knowledgeable choices regarding irriga- tion charts and the overall well-being of plants. Nutrient sensors assess soil nutrient levels, allowing for precise fertil- izer application, diminishing wastage, and mitigating the impact on the environment. Soil health sensors monitor indicators like pH, electrical conductivity, and organic mat- ter content, providing insights into soil fertility and overall health. The fundamental principle of a soil sensor is to mea- sure the soil’s electrical conductivity or dielectric constant, both of which are inﬂuenced by the soil’s water content. Typically, soil sensors feature two or more probes inserted into the soil. When the soil is dry, its electrical resistance is high, and as moisture increases, the resistance drops. By assessing this resistance, the sensor can gauge the soil’s mois- ture level [9]. 2.1. Types of Soil Sensors 2.1.1. Volumetric Soil Moisture Sensors. Volumetric soil moisture sensors are sophisticated instruments utilized to measure the total volume of water present in the soil. They provide highly accurate and reliable data, making them valu- able tools in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and research applications.
