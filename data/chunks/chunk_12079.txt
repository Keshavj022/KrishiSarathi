Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/species): Bacillus subtilis bio formulation contains efficient Bacillus subtilis DR-39 strain and having bacterial population of 1X109 CFU/g which enhance the degradation of pesticide. 2. Target crops and delivery system: It is mainly used for grapevine. As it is bio-remediation agent, it can be used for other crops also. Inoculation can be done by foliar spraying. 3. Target agro-ecological zones: All 4. Validation and commercialization: The technology has been validated for Grapes at multiple locations on farmers’ fields and vineyard of ICAR- NRC for Grapes, Pune. 5. Whether licensed to private companies, if yes, details thereof: No. The technology has been developed in collaboration with:   Zytex Biotech Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai. 6. Benefits: Bacillus subtilis DR-39 bio formulation has shown distinct response in the farmer’s field with respect to pesticide degradation. Application of Bacillus subtilis DR-39 to grapevine enhanced degradation of the 10 studied pesticides by 12.73-65.55% in ICAR-NRCG vineyards. Similar enhanced degradation was observed in farmers’ fields at four locations. 7.
