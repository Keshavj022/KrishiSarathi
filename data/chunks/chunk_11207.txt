 Cotton yy To obtain higher yield, grow Bt cotton variety PAU Bt 1 and other Bt hybrids recommended by PAU, Ludhiana. List of recommended Bt cotton hybrids is published in leading new papers and publications of PAU. Among the non Bt hybrids/varieties, grow LHH 144, F 2228, F 2383, LH 2108 and LH 2076 and desi cotton varieties LD 1019, LD 949 and FDK 124. yy Apply heavy pre-sowing irrigation preferably with canal water for good germination and early crop establishment. Ridge sowing of cotton saves substantial amount of water. In case of poor-quality irrigation water, apply pre-sowing irrigation with canal water and subsequently with poor quality tube well water in alternate furrows. Where the irrigation is saline (EC up to 10 dS/m), apply rice-residue biochar 40 q/ha to reduce the adverse effect of salinity and increased yield. yy Timely sowing of crop ensures good crop stand and crop also escapes the early attack of insect pests and diseases. Start the sowing from early April and complete by mid of May. Avoid sowing during noon hours of the day due to high temperature. 19 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy For good crop establishment and early growth, soak the cotton seed in a solution of 0.5 g succinicacid in 5 litres of water for 2-4 hours for acid delinted seed or 6-8 hours for non-delinted seed. To prevent attach of jassid at early stage, smear the seed with 5 g Gaucho 70 WS (imidacloprid) or 7 g Cruiser 30FS (thiomethoxam) per kg seed. To remove the fuzz of non-delinted seed, rub these seeds with fine earth, cow-dung or ash. yy Sow the seeds with cotton sowing drill or cotton planter with line to line spacing of 67.5 cm. Maintain plant to plant distance of 45 cm for variety PAU Bt 1 and desi cotton varieties, 60 cm for all other varieties, 75 cm for Bt and non Bt hybrids and 15 cm for variety F 2383 by thinning out extra plants after first irrigation. If plant population is less due to fewer germination and burning of seedlings at early stage, do gap filling with 3 weeks old nursery grown in 4”x6” polythene bags, filled with 1:1 mixture of soil and FYM. yy For utilization of inter row spacing of cotton, grow one row of maize or cowpea in between two rows of cotton. Take one harvest of maize/ cowpea fodder at 45-55 days after sowing. yy For the control of weeds, give need based 2-3 hoeing with tractor mounted cultivator/ tractor operated rotary weeder/triphali or wheel hand hoe. Avoid their use after fruiting. yy Apply urea 162.5 kg to non-Bt varieties, 200 kg to Bt variety (PAU Bt 1) and 225 kg to all Bt and non- Bt hybrids, DAP 67.5 kg or SSP 187.5 kg per ha. Omit phosphorus (DAP or SSP) application to cotton when it follows wheat which had received recommended dose of phosphorus. Reduce the dose of urea by 25 kg when 67.5 kg DAP is applied to cotton. Apply 50 kg muriate of potash and 25 kg zinc sulphate heptahydrate (21%) or 16.25 kg zinc sulphate monohydrate (33%) per ha to cotton in light soils.
