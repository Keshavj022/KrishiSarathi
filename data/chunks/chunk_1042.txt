 Non-shattering cultivars are required to prevent yield loss in the field, while post-harvest technology demands free threshing of grains and easy dehulling for minimizing human drudgery. Compared to other crops, attention on small millets was limited till establishment of separate AICRP on small millets in 1986. The project focuses on developing high yielding cultivars and appropriate production technologies to meet regional needs through multidisciplinary approach involving centres located in State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) and other cooperating centres. Through the efforts of AICRP a number of varieties with higher yield, variable maturity, tolerance to various diseases and insect pests have been Table 3.

Keeping in view the declining area, more intensive efforts and support both in terms of research and development is needed for sustaining the production of small millets. Apart from Government support, many NGOs and SHGs (Self Help Groups) are also actively involved in promoting millet cultivation and consumption. Future thrust areas The area under small millets is declining year after year, which needs to be arrested with the involvement of all stakeholders.
