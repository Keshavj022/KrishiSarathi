 Subsequently, this data traverses one or multiple hidden layers, where it undergoes transformations to become valuable input for the output layer. Ultimately, the output layer generates a response, presenting the output of the Artificial Neural Network in response to the provided input data. In most neural networks, units are interconnected between layers, and each connection possesses weights that dictate the impact of one unit on another. As data moves from one unit to another, the neural network progressively learns more about the data, culminating in an output from the output layer.

The initial layer in an artificial neural network is known as the input layer, responsible for receiving input from external sources and transmitting it to the subsequent layer, known as the hidden layer. Within the hidden layer, each neuron receives input from neurons in the preceding layer, computes the weighted sum, and transmits the result to the neurons in the subsequent layer. These connections involve weighted means, where the impacts of inputs from the preceding layer are fine-tuned by assigning varying weights to each input. These weights are adjusted during the training process to optimize model performance.

Artificial Neural Network can be taught instead of being extensively programmed.
