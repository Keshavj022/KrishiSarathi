After this first biological, ICAR-IVRI, Izatnagar played a major role in developing a series of other biologicals in the country including anti- anthrax serum in 1902, polyvalent HS vaccine in 1908, black quarter vaccine in 1906-08, goat tissue virus (GTV) vaccine in 1927; Ranikhet disease vaccine in 1940, tissue culture Rinderpest Vaccine (TCRP Vaccine) technology, inactivated Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccine in 1946-52; inactivated African horse Sickness vaccine in 1960-65; irradiated lungworm vaccine in 1973; inactivated goatpox vaccine in 1986, live attenuated PPR vaccine in 2001; low volume (2.0 ml) saponified haemorrhagic septicaemia vaccine in 2004. Live attenuated Vero cell-based vaccines for goatpox, high passage goatpox vaccine, sheeppox, orf, camelpox, buffalopox, combined conventional goatpox and PPR vaccine for goats, double combination sheeppox and PPR vaccine for sheep, triple combination (HGPV+PPR+Orf) vaccine for goats were developed during 2005- 2008. On the same line, other Animal Science Institutes such as ICAR-National Research Centre on Equines, Hisar (ICAR-NRCE, Hisar) developed Equine Herpesvirus-1 vaccine and Equine Influenza vaccine (Updated) and ICAR- Central Institute for Research on Goats, Makhdoom (ICAR-CIRG, Makhdoom) developed Johne’s Disease Vaccine (Inactivated).
