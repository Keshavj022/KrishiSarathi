Mid October is the best time for itâ€™s sowing, and sowing should be done in lines with 30 cm line spacing for all cultivars except HPG 17 for which line spacing of 50 cm is recommended with optimum depth of 10-12.5 cm. The seed rate for small & medium sized seeded chickpea cultivars like Himachal chana -1, Himachal chana-2, GPF-2, Palam chana-1 is 40-45 Kg/ha however, for bold seeded cultivars like HPG 17, seed rate of 80Kg/ha is recommended. Urea 65 Kg, SSP 375Kg and 50Kg MOP per ha is recommended for the cultivation of chickpea. The full dose of SSP, MOP and half dose of Urea should be applied at the time of sowing while reaming half dose of Urea should be given to crop after 4-5 weeks of sowing. For the management of pod borer in chickpea, spray the crop with Carbaryl 50 WP @1250 gm/ha and apply bavistin @1g / L of water for the management of Acochyta blight. Lentil Vipasha and Markandey are the recommended cultivars of Lentil which can be sown between October end to mid November ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 17 with seed rate of 25-30Kg/ha.

First fortnight of October is the best time for the cultivation of these crops. The seed rate of 6Kg/ha is required, and sowing should be done with spacing of 30 cm line to line and 10 cm plant to plant. For brown sarson, apply full does of SSP (250Kg), MOP (65 Kg), Gipsum (140 Kg) along with 50% of Urea (65Kg) at the time of sowing while remaing dose of Urea should be applied before flowering.

Two manual weeding are required between 40-70 days of sowing for the management of weeds. Spray of Pendimethalin (Stomp 30 EC) @ 1.5 Kg /ha as a pre-emergence or Isoproturon @ 1Kg/ha in 700-800 l of water as post emergence (30-35 days of sowing) is recommended for the chemical method of weed management. Aphid is the major pest associated with this crop, which can be managed by the spray of methyl Demeton 25 EC or dimethoate 30 EC @ 1ml/L of water.
