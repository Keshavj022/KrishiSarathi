 In the region, 8 important temperate fruit crops are grown on a very small scale namely apple, pear, peach, plum, kiwi, grapes, walnut and strawberry in 6 states viz., Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Sikkim (Table 1.) The areas in NE region fall under the wet temperate region which receives mild to high chill units. The maximum area among the temperate fruits lies in Arunachal Pradesh followed by Mizoram and Sikkim. However, no area under temperate fruit cultivation has been reported in Assam and Tripura. Among the temperate fruits, the maximum area is under kiwi followed by apple, grapes, pear, walnut, plum, peach and strawberry. Similarly, the maximum production comes from the same states, where the area is available for cultivation (Table 2). Productivity of kiwi is significantly higher than the national average; however, in rest of the fruit crop, productivity level is many fold lower than the national level (Table 3). Therefore, there is an urgent need for technological interventions at a faster pace on priority crops like kiwi, persimmon, walnut, strawberry, pear and apple.

Geographically, apart from the Brahmaputra, Barak and Imphal valleys and some flatlands in between the hills of Meghalaya and Tripura, remaining two-thirds of the area is hilly terrain interspersed with valleys and plains; the altitude varies from almost sea-level to over 7,000 m (23,000 ft) above MSL.
