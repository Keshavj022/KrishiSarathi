18% which ranged from 18.22% in lathyrus to 43.14% in rajmash. The yield advantage in other crops were 42.89% in horsegram, 33.67% in pigeonpea, 33.52% in blackgram, 33.43% in fieldpea, 33.09% in mothbean, 32.88% in greengram, 32.66% in lentil and 31.31% in chickpea. This was mainly due to suitable technological interventions, farmers’ awareness and skill developed among farmers by the KVKs. Cluster Frontline Demonstration on Oilseeds: During reporting period, 25,709 ha area was covered under 65,925 demonstrations on oilseed crops across the country. In kharif 8,306 ha (20,764 demonstrations), in rabi 14,929 ha area (39,021 demonstrations) and in summer season 2474 ha area (6,140 demonstrations) was covered. At national level, the average yield advantage in oilseed crops was 30.70% which ranged from 24.99 to 46.91%. It was highest in linseed (46.91%) followed by niger (41.10%), sunflower (34.29%), soybean (32.04%), mustard (29.63%), groundnut (28.91%), sesame (28.64%), safflower (27.28%) and castor (24.99%), respectably. This was possible due to farmers’ awareness, suitable technological interventions and skill developed among farmers by the KVKs activities.

Cereals: Among 29,979 FLDs on cereal crops, 1,270 varietal and other technology options were demonstrated in 15,100 FLDs in 5,182.56 ha area on rice crop by 478 KVKs in which the average yield was under demostration plots 20.00% higher than the farmers’ practice. A total of 9,263 FLDs were conducted on 537 technological options of wheat crop in 3,321.88 ha area by 274 KVKs. The Average yield in the demonstrations was 16.00% higher than the farmers’ practice. In all, 366 technological options of maize crop were demonstrated by 177 KVKs conducting 3,909 FLDs in 1,250.75 ha area wherein the yield increase was about 21% in the demonstrations over farmer’s practice. Demonstrations were also conducted on barley (731 FLDs), oats (791 FLDs) and buck wheat (165 FLDs). kodo millet and other millets were conducted in small numbers. Pulses (other than CFLDs): Among the 10,504 FLDs on various technologies of pulses, 2,562 FLDs were on blackgram (25.70% higher average yield than farmers’ practice), 2,027 on greengram (30.
