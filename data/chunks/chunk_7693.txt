 Marwari, Muzaffarnagri, Deccani and Nellore sheep are maintained under farm units for improvement through selection and production of superior germplasm. In Marwari sheep average age at first service, age at first lambing and weight at first service were 477 days, 666 days and 29.43 kg, respectively, corresponding values in Muzaffarnagri sheep were 503 days, 655 days and 38.4 kg, in Deccani sheep were 479 days, 627 days, 31.90 kg and in Nellore sheep were 489 days, 616 days and 28.04 kg, respectively. Mega Sheep Seed Project (MSSP): The project has four cooperating units namely KVAFSU, Bidar for Improving goat productivity in farmers’ flock Goat production is facing diverse challenges in different agro climatic conditions and it is necessary to carry out research and development activity to increase farmers’ income for better livelihood. AICRP on Goat Improvement is operational at 461 villages covering 2,277 registered farmers. Under this 13 registered breeds and 4 local genotypes (lesser- known goats) were covered. The project has contributed significantly by producing breeding bucks for genetic improvement in their natural habitat. There is a significant increase in income of goat farmers and enhanced food security of all stakeholders. The performance recording was carried out in 62,784 animals during the year. The farm based units namely Jamunapari, Barbari and Sirohi are working as best model for in situ conservation in the natural home tract of the breed. Farm units have significantly produced and distributed improved animals to different agencies for breed improvement as well as up- gradation of local germplasm. The field units also distributed improved bucks, provided preventive health care to 169,497 animals, resulting in lower mortality rate ranging from 1.96 to 8.10%. This increased population growth and improved farmers’ income by 32%. AICRP on Goat Improvement has bagged Breed Survivor Recognition for Malabari, Jamunapari and Surti goats. Deccani flock LIVESTOCK IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 62 Mandya Sheep; TANUVAS, Chennai for Mecheri Sheep; RAJUVAS, Bikaner for Sonadi Sheep; and ICAR- CSWRI, Avikanagar for Malpura sheep. Poultry Improvement of germplasm: Male lines, viz. PD-1 (Vanaraja male line) and PD-6 (Gramapriya male line); female lines, viz. PD-2 (Vanaraja female line) and PD-3 (Brown egg layer line) are maintained for use in developing rural chicken varieties. The analysis indicated that the selection is quite effective with significant genetic gains over the generations for trait under selection. In PD-6 (Gramapriya male line) population, the body weight and shank length at 6 weeks of age were 777.2 g and 85.3 mm, respectively, which were higher than that in previous generation. The egg production and egg weight at 40 weeks of age were 72.3 eggs and 57.2 g, respectively. In PD-2 population (S-15 generation), the egg production and egg mass at 52 weeks of age were 133.
