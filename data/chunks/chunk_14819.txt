 It is a large ensemble dataset (each set of experiments has 54 to 90 ensemble members each for future 4 ◦C warming (+4K), and 2 ◦C warming (+2K), respectively), for which initial conditions and lower boundary conditions are set differently, with varied external forces. This decreases prediction un­ certainty and has been widely used in impact assessments and adapta­ tion plans related to global warming (Ishii and Mori, 2020). This data was created particularly for use in impact assessment studies and adaptation planning for global warming and is available over specific periods, such as (+2K -warming scenarios available from 2031 to 2091, and + 4 K warming scenarios available from 2051 onwards). Hence the authors have redefined these both scenarios as optimistic (+2K from the available period 2031–2050, where the warming will like to increase by 2 ◦C by the mid-21st century and we expect and are optimistic that it will not increase beyond considering the ongoing efforts of climate change adaptations. However, on the other hand side, if the greenhouse gas emission sustained like this, and global warming continues then there is a higher probability that the warming will increase by 3 to 4 ◦C after the mid-21st century to the end of the 21st century, as similar as the IPCC scenarios (RCP8.5). Considering this, the author has redefined this sit­ uation as a pessimistic scenario and used 4 K warming scenarios data over the available period from 2051 onwards to analyze the potential impacts of this pessimistic situation. Additionally, the d4PDF data were evaluated over Indian regions and found to be in good agreement (with spatial correlation coefficients of 0.99 and 0.76 in temperature and precipitation, respectively) with some of the highly resolved operational observed datasets of APHRODITE (Nayak and Takemi, 2022). Socio-economic datasets are important indicators for the evaluation of impacts. In this study, land use/land cover data (100 × 100 m spatial resolution) focusing on agriculture land and population density (reso­ lution of 1 km) were used as an indicator to analyse the impacts of Fig. 1.

The data file obtained in the GeoTIFF format (.tiff) was processed using ArcGIS 10.6 to prepare a map on a district-level scale for the analysis of district-level impacts of drought on crop production. The district-level statistical data (crop production and prices) were obtained from reputable and trustworthy data repositories (ICRISAT data portal and the Indian Governmental Data Portal, respectively), including annual crop production for 1981–2015 and seasonal (Rabbi and Kharif) crop production for 1997–2014 based on the period of data availability.
