 Livestock Improvement Cattle Development of a crossbred strain of cattle Frieswal: On 3 November 2019, DG declared Frieswal as a breed and subsequently obtained a trademark FrieswalTM (Indian Patent Office No. 4361504 dated 28-11-2019). Established a bull mother farm of Frieswal cattle at ICAR- NDRI, Karnal by selecting 208 Frieswal cows/heifers from 850 elite cows belonging to 18 Military Farms for production of young male calves for Field Progeny Testing Programme. Total 65,543 doses of Frieswal bull semen were produced cumulating to 4,695,266 doses since the inception of the project. At present, a total of 2,055,322 semen doses are available in the stock. During the period, 7,319 semen doses were distributed to Military Farms, and 22,829 doses were sold to para-vets, state AH Departments, LDBs, and SAUs. Genetic improvement of crossbred cattle under- Field Progeny Testing Project (FPT): Under the Field Progeny Testing (FPT) project, the increase since 1995 to 2019 in average first lactation 305 days milk yields of the Frieswal progenies was recorded as 67.77% in KVASU (3285.69 kg vs 1958.4 kg), 41.95% in GADVASU (3829.6 kg vs 2697.8 kg), 12.41% in BAIF (3294.3 kg vs 2930.4 kg) and 36.07% in GBPUA&T unit (3394.8 kg vs 2494.8 kg). Also, the average age at first calving (AFC) of Frieswal progenies in corresponding period decreased by 15.77% in KVASU (957.1 days vs 1136.4 days), 31.91% in GADVASU (811.6 days vs 1192 days), 18.79% in BAIF (793 days vs 976.5 days), and 14.2% in GBPUA&T unit (985.8 days vs 1149 days). Genetic improvement of indigenous cattle breeds through Progeny Testing: Under the Indigenous Breeds Project (IBP), genetic improvements of three breeds, viz. Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal were carried out through the selection of elite animals maintained at the Germplasm (GP) unit and also at Associated herds (AH) maintained by different agencies including farmer herds in the respective breeding tract. Network Project on Buffalo Improvement All India Coordinated Research Project on buffaloes was initiated in the year 1970–71 and the main thrust was to test the sires with a view to produce proven bulls for enhancing milk production. In 1993, this was changed to Network Project on Buffalo Improvement and running at ICAR-Central Institute for Research on Buffalo, Hisar. Progeny testing in Murrah Breed is carried out at six participating institutional /SVU centres, viz. CIRB Hisar, NDRI Karnal, IVRI Izatnagar, GADVASU Ludhiana, LUVAS Hisar and ICAR Research Complex for Eastern Region Patna. About 17,200 artificial inseminations were carried out in 2019–20 at farmer’s doorstep in the village to produce daughters. The milk yields of daughters are being recorded for use in sire evaluation. At present, 5 important breeds of buffaloes namely Murrah, Nili Ravi, Jafrabadi, Surti and Bhadawari are being addressed under the Network Project.
