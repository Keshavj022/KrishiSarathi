 The genetic correlation between body weights at 4 and 5 weeks was 0.850 ± 0.029 and phenotypic correlation 0.824. The phenotypic correlation between 4 and 20 weeks body weights was 0.125 and between 5 and 20 weeks 0.098. The selection and breeding programme for development of specialized broiler male lines with white and coloured plumage continued in Coloured Synthetic Male Line (CSML), Coloured Synthetic Female Line (CSFL) and Synthetic Broiler male line (SML-2). The SML-2 line had two sub lines growth line (SG), selection was based on 6 week body weight, and index line (SF), selection criterion was 4–6 weeks feed efficiency (FE). So far, CSML and CSFL have reached seventh generation and SML-2 line has reached 11th generation of selection. Average body weight at 3 and 5 weeks in CSML were 504.04 ± 2.83 and 944.53 ± 4.69 g, respectively. The corresponding means in CSFL were 510.29 ± 2.02 and 928.74 ± 3.53 g. The average body weight of male, female and combined progeny in growth line (SG) were 551, 441 and 476 g at 3 weeks; 938, 746 and 812 g at 4 weeks; 1,210, 992 and 1,101 g at 5 weeks; 1,576, 1,356 and 1,466 g at 6 weeks; and 1,860, 1,682 and 1,770 g at 7 weeks of age. The corresponding body weights in index line (SF) were 465, 425 and 445 g at 3 weeks; 736, 686 and 711 g at 4 weeks; 1,035, 918 and 976 g at 5 weeks; 1,360, 1,216 and 1,288 g at 6 weeks and 1,800, 1,580 and 1,690 g at 7 weeks of age.The phenotype gain in combined sex of SG for body weights at 4, 6, 7 and gains during 4–6 weeks were 28.60, 39.16, 28.70 and 8.55 g/generation, respectively. Corresponding values for realized responses in SG line were 23.06, 42.79, 39.30 and 14.5 g/generation. In SF line the phenotypic gains for body weight at 4, 6, 7 weeks, FCR (4–6 weeks) and FE (4–6 weeks) were 22.05, 27.42, 17.77 g/ generation, –0.02 and 0.003/generation. The corresponding genetic gains were 16.50, 30.83, 30.15 g/generation, –0.04 and 0.006/generation. CARI-PRIYA CARI-Priya, the unique white-shelled egg layer, achieved the first rank among all the entries in 31st random sample poultry performance test for egg production held at Bangalore centre. CARI-Priya topped in the hen-housed egg production under cage-house system. The average egg weight of 57.41 g was also ideal from commercial point of view. The performance of CARI-Priya in deep-litter system ranked among the best commercial layers available in the country. It edged over other commercial layers in almost all important economic traits and thus recognized as the ideal bird for commercial layer farmers in India.In RSPPT at Bombay the strain crosses from GAU and ANGRAU achieved excellent hen-day production of 291 and 289 eggs, respectively, and the feed consumption was well under 100 g/day. The margin of receipts was Rs 30.65 and Rs 33.26 over feed cost for both the entries.
