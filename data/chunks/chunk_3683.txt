 Phosphorus has the tendency to move from older to younger tissues, therefore, symptoms appear first on older leaves which lose their deep green colour. Leaves turn small and narrow with purplish or bronze lusterless discolouration. Some leaves may later develop necrotic areas, and young leaves show a reduced growth rate. Fruits become coarse and rough in texture with a thick rind and hollow central core. The symptoms of K-deficiency are: reduced fruit size with a very thin peel of smooth texture, premature shedding of fruits, leaf scorching, appearance of resinous yellow spots, and shoots turning S-shaped. Deficiency of Ca is mainly characterized by fading of chlorophyll along the leaf margins and between the main veins especially during winter months. Small necrotic (dead) spots develop in the faded areas. Symptoms of Mg deficiency occur on mature leaves forming yellow area gradually gaining in size, until only the tip and the base of the leaves are green showing an inverted V-shaped area pointed on the mid-rib. Interveinal white chlorosis due to Fe deficiency appears first on young leaves, a common tendency for chlorosis of all aerial parts after becoming necrotic. In acute cases, the leaves are reduced in size, turn fragile, very thin, and shed early. Mottled chlorosis in Mn deficiency with green veins and leaf web tissue yellow or white, appears first on younger leaves, then spreads to older leaves. Stems remain yellowish green, often hard and woody. Young leaves commonly show a fine pattern or network of green veins on a lighter green background, but the pattern is not so distinct as in Zn and Fe deficiencies because the leaves remain green. Wilting of terminal shoots, frequently followed by death of leaves is usually seen in Cu deficiency. Leaf colour often fades due to reduction in pigments.

Fruit symptoms are more pronounced. Brown-stained areas of hardened gum on the rind of the fruit precede the appearance of leaf and twig symptoms. Brown-stained areas on the fruits darken, and later turn black.
