 Efforts are needed for developing high-performance bio-agriculture products, for increased adoption of sustainable farming. Rising prices of synthetic inputs are projected to remain a key factor in boosting the consumption of agricultural biologicals in the coming years. The Indian bio-agriculture market size reached `62,249 million in 2022. Looking forward, IMARC group expects the market to reach `97,147 million by 2028, exhibiting a growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3% during 2023â€“2028. In another report, the global agricultural biologicals market size was valued at USD 7.2 billion in 2019 and is expected to register a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.4% from 2020 to 2027. The rising demand for organically cultivated food products is projected to be a key driving factor for the market. Market size value in 2020 was USD 7.7 billion and is likely to increase to USD 14.7 billion by 2027. Market volume in 2020 was 5,694.56 kilotonnes and is likely to increase to 10,185.68 kilotonnes by the end of 2027 at CAGR of 9.4%. In line with this, farmers are focusing on bio-agriculture due to the reduced health risks resulting from the use of non-toxic substances, which is strengthening the growth of the market. Indian Council of Agricultural Research recognized the importance of bio-agriculture, started All Indian Network Project on Soil Biodiversity-Biofertilizers at Bhopal and AICRP on Biological Control of Pests at Bengaluru. The concerted research efforts have led to development of large number of biofertilizers and biologicals for different regions. At present, there are about 20 microorganisms registered as biopesticides and more than 970 biopesticide products with regulatory body Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee (CIB & RC). ICAR research institutes have commercialized 41 biofertilizers, 31 biopesticides and 39 biocontrol agents. But emphasis is needed on collection, conservation, cataloguing and characterizing the beneficial faunas and identifying efficient biofertilizers for developing biocontrol based technologies for different agro-ecological regions, for adoption by the farmers across the country. The growth is also attributed to the constantly evolving agricultural practices in the region with respect to farming techniques, technological adaptations, and constant research and development, and government regulations promoting sustainable farming methods.
