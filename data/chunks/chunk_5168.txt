Simdega (Jharkhand). PRA and field study A field study was carried out by using PRA tools covering 20 respondents. The ITK was compared with allopathic treatment on selected parameters, viz. extent of cure, duration of treatment, cost effectiveness, safety, increase in milk yield and effect on general health. Experiment The experiment was conducted with three replications having two treatments each. In first treatment harjore paste was applied over the Fig. 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Data generated from field survey reveal that farmers believe that harjore paste is 70% effective in bone healing as compared to 80% of allopathic system of plastering with plaster of paris (Table1). The time taken for bone healing is similar in ITK and allopathic system. However, the material used in ITK is cheaper and safer also. According to farmersâ€™ perception the ITK is very valuable for cure of the cases of fracture in animals. Experiment Results presented in Table 2 show that after application of paste of harjore, 33.3% of affected animals showed recovery within 30 days, whereas in case of plaster of paris the recovery was 66.6%. Besides, one out of three cases could not recover even after 90 days of treatment with the ITK. In allopathic system of treatment 100% cases recovered within 60 days. Table 2.

VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Code : 864 Title of the ITK : Treatment for fractured bone in cattle Description of the ITK : Farmers in hilly areas of Kardang village in Lahaul district of Himachal Pradesh generally practice this method for treating the fractured bone in cattle. Manu (Inula recemosa) is a herb used for the treatment of fractured bone. Manu is ground well and its extract is spread on the fractured bone and covered tightly with the use of cotton.
