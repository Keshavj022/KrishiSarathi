 Guided by the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in Baloda Bazar (Balod), Deepak implemented a comprehensive set of farming practices on his two hectare landholding. His interventions included the application of various natural inputs like beejamrit, ghanjeewamrit, jeewamrit, mulching, and plant protection methods using neemashira, agniashtra, brahmashtra, and mixed leaf extracts. Focusing particularly on Chickpea variety RVG-202, covering 0.40 hectares, Deepak achieved a production yield of 4.76 quintals. Deepak’s venture into natural farming not only resulted in a healthy crop but also reflected positively on the conventional farming methods, reducing operational expenses significantly. Despite a slightly lower yield, the net income increased notably, alongside a favourable benefit-cost ratio. His success highlights the viability and sustainability of natural farming practices, bringing economic benefits while contributing to soil health and organic matter improvement. With a commitment to continue natural farming with the support of KVK, Deepak’s experience stands as an inspiring model for fellow farmers seeking cost-effective and environmentally friendly agricultural solutions. economic performance of his farm. The adoption of these practices led to a lower cost of cultivation compared to friendly, and prosperous farming communities. SUMMARY Natural farming emerges as a promising and sustainable agricultural approach with multifaceted benefits. Through its emphasis on organic inputs, minimal chemical usage, and holistic ecosystem management, natural farming not only enhances soil health and fertility but also promotes biodiversity and reduces environmental degradation. The success stories presented underscore the viability of natural farming, with higher yields, lower costs, and improved profitability compared to conventional farming practices. These success stories exemplify the transformative potential of natural farming in revitalizing agricultural systems by rejuvenating soil health, increasing crop yields, and empowering farming communities. As we navigate the challenges of climate change, resource depletion, and food insecurity, the adoption of natural farming practices offers a pathway towards a more sustainable and resilient future for agriculture. Through the guidance and support of Krishi Vigyan Kendras/ ATARIs, farmers across India are embracing sustainable agricultural practices and reaping the rewards. By celebrating these successes and sharing their lessons, we can inspire more farmers to embrace the principles of natural farming and contribute to building a healthier, more vibrant planet for generations to come. *Corresponding author email: srksingh.icar@gmail.
