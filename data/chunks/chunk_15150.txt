 While this approach allowed for in- depth insights from a high-adoption state, it limits the generalizability of findings to other semi-arid states with potentially different adoption landscapes. In future research, it is important to broaden focus group discussions and conduct farmer interviews across more semi-arid states in order to better understand the challenges faced by MI technology adopters and non-adopters. Exploring the relationship between water quality, MI technologies, and farmers’ income and livelihoods will provide valuable insights into the overall sustainability and viability of these technolo­ gies. Additionally, studying the economic impact of MI adoption and raising awareness about subsidies and government policies related to MI technologies are important for sustainable agricultural practices. Research efforts should focus on developing strategies to enhance farmers’ understanding and utilization of available support mecha­ nisms. Initiatives such as joint farming and collaborative water-sharing methods should be further explored as viable solutions to address small and marginal farmers’ challenges, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and sustainable agricultural landscape. 6. Policy implications Promoting micro-irrigation (MI) technologies in countries such as India has the potential to enhance agricultural productivity, water conservation, and sustainability significantly. Below are key policy recommendations aimed at facilitating MI technology adoption: 1. Timely subsidies or financial incentives should be provided to smallholder farmers who face challenges in affording upfront costs. Ensuring easy access to credit facilities or low-interest loans tailored for investment in drip irrigation infrastructure can enhance afford­ ability and accessibility for all farmers. 2. Develop essential infrastructure such as water storage facilities, pumping systems, and irrigation filters at subsidized rates, particu­ larly in economically disadvantaged regions (Angom and Viswana­ than, 2023). Introducing portable MI irrigation kits that can adapt to various cropping systems is essential to cater to smallholder farmers with diverse land locations and cropping patterns. 3. Effective training programs and workshops should be conducted to educate farmers about technical aspects, and collaboration with the private sector for installation guidance is essential. Implementation of regulatory frameworks addressing electricity quality, equipment standards, and water pricing mechanisms can incentivize efficient water use and promote sustainable farming practices (Kumar et al., 2022). Funding The focus group discussions and interviews were carried out as part of the Water for Sustainable Development (WSD) project, which is funded by the Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan and implemented by the United Nations University Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability (UNU-IAS).
