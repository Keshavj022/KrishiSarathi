The performance of improved practices was better than the farmers’ existing practice in terms of increase in yields ranging between 16- 40%. The grain yield of rabi sorghum (40%) over the years was highest, followed by pearl millet (24%), foxtail millet (22%), brown top millet and finger millet (21%) and Yellow sorghum (20%). Thus, the farmers could get better remuneration from the demonstrated technologies under the project. Two high-yielding and flower drop resistant varieties of red gram (Asha and WRGE 97) gave substantial profits with16% higher yield over the local cultivars of existing practices. On average, net returns were highest in Yellow Jowar (57%), followed by red gram (54%), sorghum hybrid (52%), and barnyard millet (52%). The net returns of all the millet crops under improved practice increased ranging between 27-57% as compared to farmers’ practice. Further, the net returns were 3-4 times higher when their raw produce was processed primarily and dehulled compared to unprocessed produce. The farmers were happy with the performance of millet interventions which enabled them to fetch a good net returns under rainfed cultivation and demands the seeds to continue. Livestock module In the livestock module, an average income obtained from the improved poultry farming ranged between ` 10,000-32,000/annum to each family by selling of eggs and birds from each unit, over the years. From improved sheep farming, an average income of ` 36,900/annum to each SHG was obtained by selling of multiplied population from each unit of 11 Nellore sheep, over the years. These interventions helped the farmers in earning round the year income by utilizing the byproducts Grain yield obtained from millet crop interventions in farmers’ fields Field view of rabi sorghum Field view of red gram variety (Asha) Indian Farming 13 November 2024 of millets as fodder and feed, efficiently as well as improved nutritional status of the farm families by enhancing consumption of eggs and meat. Though, some of the lamb and birds died due to unknown diseases, marginal supportive profits were obtained.
