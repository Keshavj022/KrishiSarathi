 Using this median cutoff to proxy for access to employment in non-agriculture is reasonable in this context — over 80 percent of rural non-agricultural workers report daily commutes of less than 10 kilometers in the 2011 Census.20 I thus assume that labor markets are local due to limited labor mobility. I fully interact the variables in Eqs. (2), (4) and (5) with this binary measure. The estimating equations for the direct, incidental and pooled ef- fects respectively take the form: 𝑦𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡= 𝛽1 𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡+ 𝛽2 𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡∗𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑣 + 𝛼1 𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 + 𝛼2 𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡∗𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑣+ 𝜌𝑖+ 𝛾𝑠𝑡+ 𝜖𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡 (6) 𝑦𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡= 𝜃1 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡+ 𝜃2 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡∗𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑣+ 𝜙1 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 + 𝜙2 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡∗𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑣+ 𝜌𝑖+ 𝛾𝑠𝑡+ 𝜖𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡 (7) 𝑦𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡= 𝛿1 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡+ 𝛿2 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡∗𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑣 + 𝜂1 𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 + 𝜇1 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡+ 𝜂2 𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡∗𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑣 + 𝜇2 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑣∗𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡∗𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑣+ 𝜌𝑖+ 𝛾𝑠𝑡+ 𝜖𝑖𝑣𝑠𝑡 (8) 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑣is an indicator that equals 1 if village 𝑣is within 10 kilo- meters of the nearest town at baseline. 𝛿1 + 𝛿2 captures the effect of access to improved road infrastructure for households that are in close proximity to a town, and subsequently, to employment opportunities in the non-agricultural sector, while 𝛿1 captures the effect of improved access to road infrastructure for households that are further away from towns. 20 Appendix Figure A2 summarizes information collected in the 2011 India Census on commuting patterns among non-agricultural workers in rural India. 38 percent of workers have no commute to work, 22 percent commute by foot, and 13 percent commute by bicycle (panel A). Further, for over 80 percent of workers, the daily commuting distance is less than 10 kilometers (panel B). Journal of Development Economics 152 (2021) 102686 7 Y.
