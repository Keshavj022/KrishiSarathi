 Validation of newly developed markers for LLS and rust diseases: Twenty-four markers were used for validation in 12 groundnut varieties resistant to both late leaf spot and rust diseases and 9 varieties resistant to rust only to find out any alleles other than alleles from GPBD 4 which can be utilized for breeding. All markers differentiated resistant varieties justified by their phenotypes (disease score). After screening with all the markers of targeted genomic region, it was observed that all the 12 groundnut varieties resistant to both LLS and rust diseases, carry resistant alleles. These markers were able to clearly differentiate resistant and susceptible varieties specified by their allelic pattern. Seed Production Breeder seed production: The total breeder seed production in field crops was 1,15,293.4 q against the DAC & FW indent of 83,690.1 q. The major share in total breeder seed production belongs to cereal crops, i.e. 61,976.6 q against indent of 36,814.1 q. Under pulse crops a total of 23,530.4 q breeder seed was produced against the indent of 18,698.4 q. In oilseeds, total breeder seed production was 28,871.7 q against the indent of 27,567.2 q. Breeder seed produced in case of fiber crops was 121.2 q against the indent of 90.4 q and in forage crops, 793.5 q was produced against the indent of 520.1 q. Quality seed production: Total production of quality seed including all classes was 4,68,610 q against the target of 3,88,137 q. Production comprises 1,38,337 q of foundation seed, 1,80,805 q of certified seeds, 87,492 q of truthfully labelled seed and 61,976 q of planting material of field crops. In addition, 178.1 lakh planting material and 12.2 lakh tissue culture plantlets were Breeder seed production in Sugarcane The year was an exemplary period for seed production in sugarcane especially for ICAR-SBI, Coimbatore. A huge indent of about 2,300 tonnes of quality seed has been received from Director of Sugars, Govt of Tamil Nadu. Due to paucity of cultivable land at the Institute, progressive farmers were selected to undertake farmersâ€™ participatory seed production from Seyur, Mathampalayam, Veerapandi, Vellamadai and Neelambur, and trained to undertake quality seed production under technical guidance of the scientists. About 21,478.96 q of quality seed were supplied to both cooperative and private sugar factories in Tamil Nadu as per block-wise allotments from the Directorate. Through apical meristem tip culture, the varieties Co 86032, Co 0212, Co 09004, Co 0238, Co 0118,Co 06022, Co V 09356 and new clone Co 11015 were multiplied and were virus indexed against SCYLV, SCMV, SCSMV and GSD. About 90,000 tissue culture plants and 49 virus free mother culture flasks of varieties Co 86032, Co 0212 and Co 09004 were supplied to the sugar mills and private tissue culture laboratories, respectively, for production of quality planting material in sugarcane.
