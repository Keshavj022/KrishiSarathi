 The CSAT practices are: 1. Seed variety (climate resilient varieties); 2. Pest control (natural pest control like bio pest control); 3. Fertilizer use (organic fertilizer use); 4. Soil test; 5. Row planting; 6. Irrigation; 7. Composting (Bio composting); 8. Marketing (use of infor- mation and communication technology like online marketing); 9. Access to credit (formal credit); 10. Insurance (against any crop failure due to climate change); 11. Tractor; 12. Power tiller; 13. Seed sowing machine; 14. Sprayer; 15. Weeding machine; 16. Crop-cutting machine; 17. Fan; 18. Storage facility (like cold storage to reduce waste and market the produce where there is a dearth of supply). The CSATAI is determined using the weighted arith- metic mean approach (the weights being uniform) and is deﬁned as: CSATAI ¼ P 18 1 Ii 18 (2) A value of “1” is assigned to households that possess and/or adapt any technology, while a value of “0” is assigned to households that do not possess any technology. The household with all the technology has CSATAI ¼ 1, and the household with no indicators have CSATAI ¼ 0. Thus, the value of CSATAI lies between 0 and 1, i.e., 0  CSATAI  1. For empirical estimation purposes, however, there is an issue with the dependent variable being a fraction. In the present case, the Regression equation would be like this: HI ¼ ðXÞβ þ ε (3) where “ε” is the error term assumed to satisfy all the assumptions of the CLR technique, “X” is the matrix of all independent variables, including intercept, intercept dummy, and slope dummy, and β is the vector of regression coefﬁcients. Here, the population assumption under CLR should be: EðHIÞ  Normal  ðXÞbβ; σ2 ε  (4) where “σ2 ε” is VarðεÞ. This normality assumption of “HI” is not reasonable as it is a ratio. This gives rise to two types of problems: ﬁrstly, the problem of heteroscedasticity, which implies the variance is smaller near the extreme values. The second problem is with respect to the asymmetry Table 3 Statistical summary. Variable Observations Mean Std. Dev.
