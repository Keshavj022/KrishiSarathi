Successful livestock rearing can be achieved through increased fodder availability, improved shelter management for resilience against different climate vulnerabilities. Introduction of improved breeds of small ruminants, improving the health of animals as better health makes animals more tolerant to climatic stresses. The fodder availability can be increased by cultivation of high biomass fodder crops (fodder bajra, oats, Napier grass, multicut sorghum), improved fodder varieties. Feed supplements, micronutrient use to overcome mineral deficiency to enhance adaptation to heat stress are some key interventions. This improved fodder can increase milk production by 10–15% and a reduction in the calving period by 45–60 days in addition to the birth of healthy offspring. Supplemental feeding can meet off-season fodder needs, but its high cost is often unaffordable for smallholders. Establishing fodder banks on available community land in villages offers a more viable solution. In the fodder bank, high-quality and higher biomass fodder species which grows in short time and bridge the forage scarcity during the annual dry seasons are preferred. Community fodder banks were established in different villages, particularly, in villages which face acute scarcity of fodder during dry/summer seasons.
