 The general neglect of agriculture has been put forth for this deceleration, which coincided with limited benefits from the terms of trade. The revival began in the mid-2000s, since when both the terms of trade and agricultural expenditures began to improve. The pace of acceleration has been much faster than that was observed during the 1980s. Agricultural productivity has risen faster, notably among the low-productivity states since the mid-2000s. Growth has turned more inclusive in agriculture since then, establishing convergence in agricultural productivity (Balaji and Pal 2014). It is to be noted that growth in the agriculture sector lagged far behind the non-agriculture during the entire period. Consequently, the share of agriculture in national output (GVA) has declined over time. There is a trend reversal in recent years, with agriculture growing faster. Further, the growth during the past three years is at the historically highest level since the independence on account of concerted efforts towards technological interventions and policy reforms. Indian Agriculture after Independence 384 2.2. Agricultural growth at the disaggregated level Agriculture and allied sectors comprise crops, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture, and forestry and logging sub-sectors. Growth has varied significantly across the sub-sectors (Table 2). The overall growth was at the historically highest level during the recent decade (2011-12 to 2019-20). The sub-sectors such as crops and livestock grew at the same pace during the first five decades since the year 1950-51. Since 2001-02, the livestock sector is growing at a significantly higher rate as compared to the crop sub-sector. The growth of the crop sub-sector is decelerating in recent years. Fisheries and aquaculture have also registered significant growth in their output. These two sectors â€“ both livestock and fisheries have helped to sustain higher growth in agriculture over decades.

Changing composition agricultural output in India Source: Estimates based on MOSPI (2020) data 385 Investment, Policy and Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Diversification has been the prime factor behind growth acceleration and convergence. A general shift from crops towards livestock and fisheries sectors is obvious across states (Pal et al. 2020), driven by the demand arising from higher growth in industrial and service sectors observed above and subsequent rise in income per capita.
