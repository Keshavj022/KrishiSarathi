 Performance ratio for (a) Composite climate (Patna), (b) Warm and humid climate (Amaravati), (c) Hot and dry climate (Jaisalmer), (d) Temperate climate (Bangalore), and (e) Cold climate (Itanagar). A.K. Yadav et al. Results in Engineering 23 (2024) 102584 8 • From the survey, 80 % of farmers liked the developed model and would implement it in the fields in the future. • Pump efficiency is lowest at 57.10 % in temperate and a maximum of 58.60 % for hot and dry, warm and humid climatic zones. • Cold climates have less PV-array loss than hot and dry climates. • System losses vary from 0.27 to 0.37 kWh/kWp/day. Hot and dry climates have more system losses than composites. • It was found that Bangalore, with a temperate zone, has a minimum performance ratio, and Jaisalmer, with hot and dry, has a maximum performance ratio. The performance ratio varies from 0.514 to 0.739.
