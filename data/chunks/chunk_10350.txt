 Effective disease diagnosis and control measures are becoming more critical in culture operations, because of increased stocking numbers and changing climatic conditions. Priority should be given to developing vaccines to prevent disease, as well as treatments and chemicals that have the least adverse effects on the environment. More emphasis is needed on post-harvest value addition to create high-value products, besides effective utilization of low-value species or fish waste. Though numerous technologies have been developed across diverse domains, for greater adoption at the ground level, better integration of technologies as well as collaboration with other organizations and departments are essential. Finally, fish is becoming important as a health food, and therefore, ensuring quality and safe fish production is of foremost priority.
