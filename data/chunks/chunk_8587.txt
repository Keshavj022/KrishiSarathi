 The Barbari goat has shown impressive population growth of about 145% during 2001–02. The first kid was obtained at 377 days indicating the potential of Barbari goat as a successful commercial breed. The flock mortality was 8.46% during the year. PIG Under the All India Coordinated Research Project on Pigs, 50–80% crossbred F1 progenies were produced at all the Centres. Energy-protein ratio for optimum production is being worked out. RABBIT Rabbit for Wool Kit survivability in German Angora was 97.45% and British Angora 90.90% respectively. Average litter size at birth (LSB) and litter size at weaning (LSW) were 5.39 and 5.25 in German Angora, and 6.60 and 6.00 in British Angora, respectively. Average LSB of GA and BA were 249.70 and 333.0 g while pooled weaning weights (42 days) were 560.74 g and 630.83 g respectively. Rabbit for Meat In broiler rabbits maintained at the CSWRI, Avikanagar, the overall means of LSB litter weight at birth, LSW, litter weight at weaning and weight at kindling were 5.45, 268.95 g, 4.80, 1,894.44 g and 3.16 kg respectively. The body weight at 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 weeks were 390.07, 604.25, 808.55, 1,179.83 and 2,041.45 g respectively. At the NTRS, Garsa, the LSB were 6.23, 5.41, 5.26 and 5.0 in GG, WG, SC and NZW, respectively, and LSW were 5.3, 4.66, 4.29 and 5.00 respectively. The body weight at 84 days was 1.75, 1.7, 1.48 and 1.35 kg in NZW, WG, SC and GG respectively. Daily weight gain was highest in rabbits weaned at 28 days as compared to the animals weaned at 35 and 42 days. The kits survivability ranged from 81 to Sirohi performance improved after selection DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 104 100%. The rabbits reared during winter performed better than those reared during summer and rainy season. At the SRRC, Mannavanur, 883 kits were produced. Overall kit mortality was 24.7%. Mean weight at 6 weeks was 0.728 and 0.764 kg in WG and SC, respectively. Weight at 12 week was 1.525 and 1.507 kg in WG and SC, respectively. LSB, LSW, LWB and LWW were 6.8 and 6.5, 403 g and 375.8 g; 6.0 and 5.1 and 4.337 kg and 3.898 kg for WG and SC, respectively. POULTRY Poultry for Egg Comparative performance of White Leghorn pure strains: At the CARI, Izatnagar, various strains of White Leghorn population completed part record egg production up to 40th week of age after S25 generation of selection. Their pullets matured between the average age range of 134 and 145 days compared to 164 days of age in the control line. In WL strains early egg weight at 28th week of age ranged from 46 to 49.60 g and at 40th week 53.50 to 57 g, while in the control population 60.87 g. The egg production ranged from 96.74 to 104 eggs up to 40th week of age in WL selected strains, and 75 eggs in the control population. The genetic changes in ASM and 40th week egg weight were highly significant and negative in direction. The ASM declined to the tune of –0.46 to –1.04 days, whereas, egg weight declined from – 0.10 to – 0.21 g per generation.
