 In his paper, he mentioned that the first European settlers in Nilgiris recorded the flowering of the Strobilanthes kunthianus over the hill ranges of Nilgiris in Shantesh Ramesh Kamath*, Girish P M, Saipriya Panigrahi, Namita and Sapna Panwar the year 1826. The gregarious flowering of Strobilanthes kunthianus in Nilgiris was found once every 12 years and in full bloom in 1838, 1850, 1862, 1874, 1886, 1898, 1910, 1922 and 1934.

It was identified in India during 19th century by Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck who described as the plant belonging to the genus Strobilanthes. The genus Strobilanthes has about 450 species. Out of that, around more than 160 species are found in India, of which 72 species are endemic to the Western Ghats. India stands first in the diversity of the genus Strobilanthes about 40% of the total diversity. It is also considered one of the most interesting genera, for its medicinal properties and gregarious and infrequent flowering. Most of the species are perennial and plietesials nature, flowering cycle varies from 3 to 16 years depending on the species. The genus Strobilanthes is distributed in the tropical and subtropical parts of the Indian subcontinent and South-East Asia. Apart from the Shola forests of Western Floral wealth July–August 2023 37 Ghats, it is distributed in Shevroys in the Eastern Ghats and peninsular plains. The Western Ghats are considered hotspot for this genus. The species of Strobilanthes are adapted to the grassy lands of the Western Ghats and grow from 100 to 2500 m above mean sea level, grows profusely in the Shola forest of Western Ghats. Plant biology �The species belonging to genus Strobilanthes are small shrubs reaching a height of 0.5–3.0 m. Some of the Cholakurinjis like Strobilanthes homotropus, S. gracilis and S. luridus grow up to 8 m. The species of Neelakurunji have varied habit from short perennial herbs to densely branched erect shrubs. Flowers are sessile or pedicellate in open panicles with bracteate heads or spikes. Leaves are opposite, petiolate or sessile; leaf blade adaxial usually with prominent linear cystoliths and sometimes also abaxial, margin variously dentate, serrate, crenate, undulate, or entire. Many species are cultivated for their two lipped, hooded flowers in varied shades of blue, pink, white and purple. These plants grow for several years before flowering, setting seed and dying. inflammatory, antiosteoarthritic, analgesic properties and antioxidant activity. Kurinjithen, a rare honey is derived from the mass flowering of Neelakurinji flowers. According to local people, this rare honey is known for its medicinal properties which has ability to cure heart blockages.
