 PDS prices during 1990s have increased in jumps and at a faster rate compared to open market prices, and prices of other food and other commodities which caused a decline in per capita PDS demand in the recent years. Diversification in consumption pattern, which is associated with improvement in per capita income and shift in food preference also possibly caused decline in per capita demand for cereals in open market. An important reason for high policy support to grains to continue, till recently, is that demand projections for grains did not take note of diversification in consumption pattern experienced in rural as well as urban areas. This has resulted in fast growth of the import of edible oils, while pulse deficit is reflected in both imports as well as in the increase in domestic prices of pulses. Hence there is a need for suitable policy to address these imbalances. Price regulation Price regulation Price regulation Price regulation Price regulation The regulatory mechanism should be used only when price movements are outside the desired price band representing width between the ceiling and floor price, which permits reasonable marketing margin for profitable public sector operations. The government intervention in foodgrains markets must allow and encourage active participation of private trade but check their exploitative tendencies. The study has prepared estimates of price band between farm harvest prices of wheat and paddy in surplus states and wholesale and retail price in subsequent months in all major states of the country, and these have required/justified participation of private trade in grain marketing.
