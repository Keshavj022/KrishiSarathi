The erosion of fragile drylands impacts 25% of the world’s land area, endangering the lives of 900 million people in a hundred nations. One-sixth of the world’s population is affected by de- sertiﬁcation. In these drylands, 800 million people lack appropri- ate food supplies. The issue is very prevalent in India. The re- stricted focus on soil and water conservation as a solution to drylands is constraining national effort s to ﬁght land degradation ( Kumar et al., 2020a ; Badapalli et al., 2021 ). Drylands cover 228.3 million hectares of land in India (about 69.6%). According to the Space Application Centre, the total area undergoing land degra- dation in India is 105.48 million hectares, accounting for 32.07 percent of the country’s total land area, while the area undergo- ing desertiﬁcation is 81.45 million hectares, accounting for 24.78 percent of the country’s geographical area ( Miller et al., 1998 ; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geogeo.2022.100131 2772-8838/© 2022 The Authors.

Land suitability analysis (LSA) is a method of determining suit- ability levels for speciﬁc uses such as agriculture, plantation, recre- ation, settlement, industry, watershed management, and so on, based on social, physical, and economic factors such as slope, soil, relief, humidity, drainage, rainfall, and so on ( FAO, 1976 ). LSA is an interdisciplinary decision-making method. A variety of things inﬂuence the LSA decision-making process. As a result, sev- eral researchers have used an MCDM based on a GIS to conduct LSA to identify potential areas for various purposes such as agri- culture and plantation, settlement, and so on. ( Liu et al., 2018 ; Kadam et al., 2019 ; Everest et al., 2021 ; Golla et al., 2022 ). These elements, however, are misused and abused. Soil ero- sion, waterlogging, groundwater depletion, excessive run-off, pro- ductivity losses, and other issues plague many areas. Food and en- ergy security, water availability and quality, biodiversity, human life, and other factors are all threatened by degraded lands. As a result, several studies for LSA and land use planning and man- agement are carried out. LSA is an important component of long- term land management ( Mendas et al., 2012 ; Ostovari et al., 2019 ; Rajasekhar et al., 2020 ; Purnamasari, 2022 ). Multi-criteria analyses in GIS were used to identify prospective agricultural and plantation regions.
