 The technology helps in effective utilization of pericarp, otherwise discarded, by preparing the Nutmeg Taffy, a value-added food product, in a commercially feasible manner. The product stores well at room temperature for about 12 months with simple packing without any synthetic preservatives. Two new brinjal varieties resistant to bacterial wilt released: Two wilt resistant varieties, viz. Goa Brinjal 5 and Goa Brinjal 6 has been developed for cultivation in Goa. Both the types are oblong, purple with a yield of 230–250 q/ha and resistant to bacterial wilt. Patent granted to “Extender for the preservation of boar semen” An application No. 3037/MUM/ 2015 dated 11 August 2015, entitled “Extender for the preservation of boar semen” invented by ICAR-CCARI, Goa, was granted patent No. 355114 on 1 January 2021. The boar semen invention helps in effectively preserving porcine semen of pig for periods extending at least 48 to 72 h ideally and even up to 120 h or more, at holding temperatures of 15–17°C. This extender preserves pig semen in a liquid state. This extender has a simple, cost-effective protocol and is easy for even a layperson to use. Researchers have used this product for their research work, and different pig production centres in neighbouring states regularly procure this extender for pig breeding through AI. Potential beneficiaries of this technology include pig farmers, researchers, state animal husbandry departments, industrialists and agri-entrepreneurs. Goa Brinjal-5 Goa Brinjal-6 Integrated Farming System Models for eastern plateau and hill region: Integrated farming systems were introduced for monocrop prevailing in Eastern Plateau and Hill region through participatory approach. The activities were undertaken in three villages situated at a distance 18 to 21 km from Ranchi, Jharkhand. Among the different systems, field crops + Horticulture + Dairy + Goatary + Backyard poultry was found to be the most prominent farming system with total agricultural income per ha of land holding of ` 1.3 RESEARCH FOR TRIBAL AND HILL REGIONS ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 157 Effect of technological intervention on total income lakh/ha. Due to the technology demonstration, average agricultural income of the family increased from ` 1.7 lakh to ` 2.4 lakh, whereas the average per ha income increased from ` 0.80 lakh/ha to ` 1.23 lakh/ha. The increase in the income was attributed to average increase in the income from cereals (7.33%), pulses (77.78%), oil seeds (12.59%), vegetables (150.85%), fruits (16.67%), lac (201.52%), cattle (8.2%), goat (11.45%), poultry (6.35%), duck (4.43%), pig (7.72%) and additional income of ` 1540 from mushroom. The intervention also resulted in increasing employment opportunities for the farm families through mandays generation and the average number of mandays per family increased from 105 to 206. ❑ 16.
