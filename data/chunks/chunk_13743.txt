 The wet Eastern regions and the arid Northwestern regions can emphasize the contrast in further of the Kriging maps. 5. Conclusion & future scope The analysis of rainfall trends (1901–2022) revealed significant shifts in patterns, highlighting the impact of climate variability in India. The use of machine learning models, particularly ANN- MLP, demonstrated improved accuracy in forecasting future rainfall when combined with climate parameters like temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The integration of geo-statistical techniques such as Kriging further enhanced the spatial mapping of rainfall trends. For future research, it is recommended to explore higher-resolution data, apply ensemble modeling approaches, and investigate additional soft computing techniques to enhance prediction accuracy and capture the complexities of India’s diverse climate patterns. Machine learning is a popular approach and thus many different application were done in the literature [11-28].
