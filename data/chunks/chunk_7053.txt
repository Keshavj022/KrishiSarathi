 In flowers, germplasm in various crops such as tuberose (1), gladiolus (12), gerbera (16), dahlia (30); and in medicinal plants germplasm in crops such as gudmar Gymnema sylvestre (31), brahmi Bacopa monnieri (71), bhringaraj Eclipta alba (53) and mushroom (2) were collected. Potato: A total of four new indigenous germplasm accessions of potato were collected such as, Shalimar Potato 1, Shalimar Potato 2 and Gurej local from Kashmir and Phulbani local from Bhubaneshwar. Exotic sources Fruit crops: A total of 19 banana from International Transit Centre, Belgium; seven grape germplasm accessions (EC-772086, EC-772108, EC-772080, EC- 772094, EC-772072 and Black Ferdeina) from ICAR- NBPGR, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh were received. In addition, eight exotic grape accessions were received from M/s Golden Harvest Fruit Genetics LLP, Nasik (through EXIM Policy, GOI) with codes 1501, 1872, 349-72, 1530, 1570, 1670, 1324, 1553. Vegetable crops: A total of three germplasm were collected from exotic sources such as pea (Edible poded) from USA, long melon from France and cauliflower from NBPGR (through ICAR-NBPGR). Potato: A total of 37 cultures with traits suitable for processing were imported from The Netherlands (29) and USA (8). Characterization and Identification of germplasm Fruit crops Identification of Fusarium wilt Race 1 (VCG 0124) resistant banana Cavendish accessions: Identified one Grand Naine (bunch weight 30 kg) mutant (NRCBGNM Some specimens collected by different centres of AICRP-Mushroom New species described 1. Hemilea totu; 2. Sarjubrevi rostrata; 3. Campiglossa sherlyae GENETIC RESOURCES ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 29 01) and four more yielding Cavendish accessions (namely Chinese Cavendish (Acc. No. 1664), William (Acc. No. 0645), ITC 180 and Manjahaji (Acc. No. 0017)) exhibiting resistance to Foc Race 1. Identification of Pro Vitamin A (PVA) rich banana accessions: Two dessert hybrids plantain (NOP 45–102 µg/g of Dw pulp) and Pisang Awak (Progeny No. 434- 90 µg/g pulp dry weight) back grounds and one selection (ITC 2390/2) having more provitamin-A (82 µg/g of pulp dry weight) were identified. tender green shell with bold kernel (2.65 g – 3.10 g). Because of ease to remove shell of tender nut and less cashew nut shell liquid content, it has been observed suitable for vegetable purpose. ITC 2390/2 NOP 45 Progeny Progeny No. 434 No. 932 Pomegranate: One promising wild genotype (IC- 318718) for fruit cracking resistance was identified in preliminary field evaluation. NRCPS 23 NRCPS 7 IC-31871: In addition, based on preliminary field evaluation, three promising genotypes of pomegranate such as, PS 7, PS 8 and PS 23 with desirable (279 to 382 g) fruit weight were identified. Plantation crops Oil palm germplasm with high fresh fruit bunch yield: Three high yielding dura palms (female parent), viz. palm no. 420 (FFB yield- 282.65 kg/palm/year, 18 bunches, bunch weight- 15.7 kg), palm no. 271 (FFB yield- 198.
