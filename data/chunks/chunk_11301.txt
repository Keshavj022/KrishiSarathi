 yy Inter-cultivation twice at 20 and 30 DAS; irrigation twice at 30 and 50 DAS at critical growth stages i.e at flowering and pod development stages. yy Under high moisture conditions due to unusual rains drain the excess water at the earliest and apply 4-5 kg N /ha. Spray KNO3 @ 1 % or 19:19:19 or 20:20:20 or 21:21:21 @ 1%. Spray 0.5% FeSO4 to correct Fe deficiency. Spray 1 % KNO3 to mitigate drought. yy Beyond 2nd fortnight of July grow green gram and black gram as intercrops with slightly higher seed rate in cotton (1:1) or pigeon pea (1:7). Small millets as preceding crops yy Grow foxtail millet in kharif and chickpea in Rabi. Inter crop bajra with red gram in 2:1 ratio. yy Crops like jowar, bajra, foxtail millet and pulses viz., green gram, balck gram, horse gram, cowpea, field bean can be grown as contingency corps after July if monsoon is delayed. yy Grow short duration foxtail millet variety SIA 3222 (Garuda) as preceding crop in rainfed black soils. yy Seed rate for bajra is 1.6 kg/acre and sowing time is June-July. Treat the seed with Carbendazim/Mancozeb @ 3g/kg. Soak seed in 2% (20 g/lit) salt solution for 10 min to remove ergot infected seed. For rainfed crop apply 4 t FYM and fertilizers 24:12:8 kg N:P:K /acre Sugarcane yy Spray ZnSO4 @ 2.0 g/l 5 - 7 days interval to manage Zn deficiency. Apply 20 kg of ZnSO4 as basal once in every three years. yy Spay atrazin 50% WP @ 500 g/ac 3 days after planting. Spary 2,4 D Sodium salt @ 1800 g + metribuzin @ 450 ml /acre to control broadleaved weeds after 30 DAP and at 20th and 60th day after harvest in ratoon crop. Do a hand weeding at 20-25 days after harvest for ratoon cane. 191 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy Plant in deep trenches and apply 10 kg methyl parathion before planting to control stem borer. Release Trichogramma chilonis egg parasitoid @ 20,000 eggs/ acre 4 time at 30 days interval. Horticulture crops Cashew: yy Prune during June-July and plough Coconut yy Cultivate turmeric, ginger, yam, Colocasia, seasonal vegetables, pulses and ground nut in young gardens of <5 years. yy Cultivate cocoa, banana, pepper, pineapple, papaya, heliconia as intercrops in old and bearing gardens. Oil palm yy Cultivate vegetables, dwarf banana varieties, flower crops, chillies, ginger, turmeric, pineapple as intercrops in young garden and cocoa and pepper in old and bearing gardens. yy Use harvesting poles to overcome labour shortages. Mango: yy Install pheromone traps @12 per hectare to manage fruit fly. yy Prune crisscross & dried branches and left-over fruit stalks during June-July and spray 1% Bordeaux mixture, followed by application of 2/3rd dose of RDF (60-70 kg FYM, 1450 g urea, 4.2 kg SSP and 1.2 kg MOP / tree above 10 years) and spray micronutrient mixture @ 5 g/l. yy Use low-cost ripening chambers with ethylene gas emitted from 500 ppm Etherel solution. Acid lime: yy Sow green manure crops in the interspaces after receiving first rain and incorporate at 50% flowering.
