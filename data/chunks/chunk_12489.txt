   Mass vaccination and de-worming to reduce mortality to 5%. Piggery:   Most of the population is of local / desi under extensive / semi-intensive management with low productivity (27 kg / animal / year) due to inbreeding; tribals are unawareness about disease (swine flu), vaccination etc.   Improve the pig meat production by popularizing of Jharsuk Pig (60-70 kg / animal / year). Dairy: Share of exotic / crossbred cattle is less than 3% of total cattle population (8.7 million cattle)in Jharkhand. Indigenous cattle have low productivity. Major constraints are: i. Pooroutreach of veterinary services at village level’ ii. Inbreeding & poor management practice and iii. Scarcity of fodder and processing units. Steps to be taken: 244 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022   Promotion of crossbred cattle by supporting viable dairy units (2-5 lactating cows / hh)to increase productivity from 6.0 kg / animal / day to 7.0 kg   Providing preventive & therapeutic veterinary service to the remote areas through para- veterinary experts   Promoting exotic milch breeds among progressive farmers to increase their population from < 3% to > 10% of total stock and good quality indigenous milch breed among resource poor farmers   Promoting cut & carry fodder supply to the farmers on cost basis and distribution of planting material / seed of drought tolerant grasses species Anjan grass (Cenchrusciliaris), Marvel grass (Dicanthium annulatum), Guinea grass (Panicum maximum), Styloseabrana and Clitoriaternatea to farmers in villages to reduce open grazing area by 0.50 lakh ha..   Promotion of Jharkhand Milk Federation (JMF) by strengthening Cooperative network procurement centers at village level and milk plants in each district (24) for value chain. Improvement of milk production in Indigenous cattle   State indigenous cattle population 83.62 (lac) with milk production of 1.7 kg / day / cow and per capita availability of milk if only 159 gm in comparison to 263 g at national level. Most of the cattle population is of native low producing type. Constraints encountered are: (i) Anoestrus and repeat breeding problem, (ii) Low conception rate and (iii) Unawareness about disease, vaccination etc. To improve the milk productivity of native cattle (1.7 kg / day / animal to 3.0 kg) by Artificial Insemination of Indigenous milch breed with Sahiwal, Red Sindhi, Gir and Tharparkar   To improve fertility and conception rate by oestrus synchronization to get better result (50 %) through AI   Awareness and capacity building of dairy farmers about scientific dairy management and health care Reducing cost of cultivation - Farm Mechanization   Traditional farm operations are time consuming, have higher cost of operation and more drudgery. Farm Mechanization increases the productivity by 12 to 34%. The availability of total farm power in the State is less than 0.9 kW/ha.
