In India, the total area under apple cultivation in 2022 was around 0.313 million hectares yielding 2.437 metric tons. Apple belongs to the genus Malus of the Rosaceae family and it originated in Central Asia from its wild ancestor, Malus sieversi L. The old proverb ‘an apple a day keeps the doctors away’ fits well as apples contain high bioactive compounds such as vitamins, antioxidants, dietary fibers, minerals, and other phytochemicals. Moreover, medical studies have shown that the consumption of apples is beneficial for protection against various chronic diseases, owing to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, in comparison to other countries, the yield and productivity is dismally low (8.1 MT/ha), due to emerging insect-pest infestations such as San Jose scale, Quadraspidiotus perniciosus (Comstock); woolly apple aphid, Erioso malanigerum (Hausmann) and diseases such as powdery mildew, Podosphaera leucotricha (Ell. and Ev.) Salm; and scab, Venturia inaequalis Cooke (Wint) during the production period. Similarly, some disorders such as bitter pit, brown core and water core can occur during storage, which also contributes towards severe postharvest losses. For control of these pests, diseases and/or storage disorders, several management strategies and pesticides are used by the orchardists. For example, the incidence of woolly apple aphid can be reduced by spraying fenitrothion, dichlorvos, demeton-methyl, phosophamidon or dimethoate during autumn season or by spraying spirotetramat @ 0.015% (~68% control). For San Jose scale management, sprays of superior miscible oils like Hindustan Petroleum spray oil or chlorpyriphos are effective. For control of apple scab, a spray schedule consisting of several fungicides has been standardized in India and powdery mildew can be controlled by spraying myclobutanil, hexaconazole or fluquinconazole. Similarly, for the reduction of storage disorders, pre-harvest calcium sprays are usually recommended and widely used. Therefore, producers practice indiscriminate use of pesticides to control these problems.
