 This valuable liquid can be refined into biofuels or utilized as a raw material in different applications [73]. The efficiency and potential of fast pyrolysis improve the financial viability of hydrogen production. Figure 6 depicts a typical schematic of fast pyrolysis. Figure 6. Fast pyrolysis. 7.2 Microwave-assisted pyrolysis Microwave-assisted pyrolysis is an innovative approach that uses electromagnetic waves to instantly heat biomass [74]. This method provides fine heating control and focused energy absorption, hence increasing the pyrolysis reaction effective rate. This approach shows the opportunity to increase the production rate of hydrogen- rich syngas by enhancing product formation specificity. The primary goal of this technology is to improve energy transfer and hydrogen production rate using biomass [75,76]. The process is usually carried out in a low-oxygen or oxygen-free environment at temperatures between 500 and 700°C. In microwave pyrolysis, heat transfer occurs directly within the feedstock through convection rather than conduction, eliminating the need for external drying. Unlike conventional pyrolysis, which relies on electric resistance heating, microwave pyrolysis offers significantly greater efficiency due to its rapid volumetric heating shown in Figure 7. The particle size of biowastes has been found to influence hydrogen production during microwave pyrolysis. Hossain et al. [77] observed that smaller particle sizes (<1 mm) enhanced H₂ production, whereas larger particle sizes (10–12 mm) favored char formation during the microwave pyrolysis of PMF. This is attributed to the larger surface area of smaller particles, which improves the heating rate, facilitates the decomposition of PMF, and consequently boosts the production of gaseous products like H₂. The advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of conventional and fast pyrolysis techniques are shown in Table 2. Figure 7. Distinction between microwave and conventional heating mechanisms. 7.2.1 Advancement in microwave pyrolysis Advancements in microwave pyrolysis have focused on improving efficiency, product yield, and environmental sustainability. Advanced microwave pyrolysis has enhanced the process by incorporating vacuum conditions, self-purging gas integration, and Catalyst Utilization. 7.2.1.1 Incorporating vacuum conditions Conventional microwave pyrolysis typically employs nitrogen (N₂) as a carrier gas to establish an inert atmosphere for the process. However, using N₂ and subsequently removing it from the gaseous product, such as syngas, adds to the operational costs of microwave pyrolysis plants [78,79]. To address this, vacuum conditions have been introduced as an alternative to N₂. One key advantage of conducting microwave pyrolysis under vacuum conditions is the prevention of re- condensation reactions and combustion due to the shorter gas retention time in the reactor.
