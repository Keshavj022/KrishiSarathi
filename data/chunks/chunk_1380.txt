 Appraisal of these adopted villages after the inception of FFP led to the development of strategies for the revival of underutilised lands after wheat harvest. Improving managerial skill of the farmers on modern technologies of integrated management of greengram and blackgram cultivation was an important activity to justify the rationality of intervention. Hands-on trainings were provided to the farmers to gain knowledge and skills on technical know-how of improved weed management practices developed by ICAR-Directorate of Weed Research (ICAR-DWR), Jabalpur. Conducting trainings, farmer-scientist interface meetings and continuous exposure of the farmers to the research farms of ICAR- DWR enhanced the knowledge of the farmers about improved weed management practices, growing of high-yielding disease-resistant short-duration varieties, use of biofertilizer besides growing of crops through conservation tillage. Introduction of short duration high-yielding disease-resistant varieties like Samrat and Virat of greengram and PU-31 and PU-1 of blackgram, Rhizobium biofertilizer with broad-spectrum weed management through imazethapyr as critical input has given a boost to the revival of summer fallow lands from 2.1-50% in Umariya Choubey and 5.6-60% in Barauda. Continuous adoption of the integrated management technologies of greengram and blackgram cultivation by the farmers and logistic support provided by the FFP team of ICAR-DWR led to the dynamic revival of summer fallow lands up to 98% in Umariya Choubey and 97% in Barauda during last seven years under the project. Yield and economics Continuous adoption of integrated crop management technologies in terms of growing high-yielding short- duration disease-resistant varieties, use of Rhizobium biofertilizer, use of appropriate fertilizer with its proper doses and improved weed management practices resulted in additional seed yield of 1.75 q/ha (14%) to 3.12 q/ha (42%) over farmersâ€™ practice.
