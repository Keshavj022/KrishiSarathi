For instance, the usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can offer flexibility collecting real-time information of the crops enabling farmers to take timely decisions. However, little is known about the barriers to the adoption of such technologies by rural farmers in emerging economies like India. Building on an extensive literature review, focussed group discussions, and field visits, the barriers impacting the adoption are identified and classified into technical, social, behavioural, operational, economic, and implementation categories.
