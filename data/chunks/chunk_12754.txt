 Increasing the number of cross breed population through intensification of Artificial Insemination (AI): In Tripura total population of cattle are 9, 88,004 out of which 8, 40,516 are nondescript and only 1, 47, 488 are cross bred cattle. The milk production in non-descript animals is very less as compared to cross bred animals. So it is need to increase the population of cross bred animals to increase the milk production and milk productivity of animals. To augment milk production of the state through introduction of improved germplasm of Sahiwal, Tharparker, HF, Jersy into the indigenous genetic pool of cattle by means of artificial insemination with frozen semen technology. 566 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022   Training of private AI workers and provision of logistic support for all AI service at farmers’ door step.   Mass vaccination and de-worming of different livestock species and supply of vaccines and mineral mixture to the farmers.   Intensive epidemiological studies and timely disease control in different livestock species.   Incentives to commercial dairy, piggery, goat and poultry farming through enhanced and easy credit arability.   Provision of insurance coverage to livestock animals.   Development of area specific mineral mixture for livestock.   Popularization of castration to restrict the unwanted breeding. Organization of fertility camp for improving conception rate.   Integrated like horticulture – livestock- fish, pig – fish and poultry – fish farming should be popularized among farmers to get additional yield of fish to minimize the production cost as well as to provide nutritional security and self-employment opportunity for the rural people.   Extension service should be strengthened so that transfer of technology from lab to land can be properly disseminated in the farmers’ field. Poultry: Supply of improved variety of poultry germplasm: There are so many improved germplasms of chicken, (Vanaraja, Gramapriya and BND Cross) duck (Khaki Campbell) are developed specially for backyard poultry farming, which have much better production performances like more egg production, faster growth and higher body weight than these native chicken and duck. The native chicken and duck have poor egg production, slow growth, small egg and body size. Egg production (50-70 eggs per chicken and around100 eggs/ duck per annum) is very less in these deshi/local chicken and ducks of Tripura as compared to improved variety of chicken and duck. If farmers rear these improved variety of chicken and duck it will be more productive than native chicken and duck. The improved quality of the chicks and duckling is one of the major critical inputs for the poultry production. However, availability of sufficient amount of quality chicks and ducklings is a major constraint in tribal villages which are mostly located in remote palaces and covered by hilly forests.
