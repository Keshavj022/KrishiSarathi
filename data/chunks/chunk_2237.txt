 ICSV 15013, a red grained OPV with higher grain yield potential and higher grain Fe (50 ppm) and Zn (40 ppm) is under ICRISAT and ICAR- IIMR joint testing. Large-scale seed production of the ICSV 15013 was undertaken at ICRISAT during 2018-19 postrainy season for further testing in multilocation trials in Maharashtra (Parbhani and Akola) towards their commercialization in the next 1-2 years. Grain mold resistance identified (both in white and red grain), IS 20740 was found resistant with 2.0 score (on 1-9 scale) and 10 lines showed moderate resistance with 4-5 score. In Post-rainy sorghum, a new crossing program was initiated between elite postrainy B&R-lines with bold seeded durra B&R-lines respectively that have origin in ESA/Yemen, for diversifying the genetic base of postrainy sorghum. To scale the dissemination of improved cultivars, under the postrainy sorghum seed consortium partnership, more than 1000 tons of certified seed was produced in farmer fields (in Western Maharashtra and Marathwada) and procured by Mahabeej (public sector seed corporation) and supplied the seeds to 100,000 farmers in 2019. ICAR-CGIAR | ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 29 During 2019, 150 high biomass yielding sorghum lines identified that have more than 55% IVOMD, the highest among them reached 61%. These lines will be commercialized after appropriate multi- location testing and also, they form good source materials to develop improved forage lines in near future. In sweet sorghum, 50 sorghum lines were developed that have more than 22% brix content. Among them, the line with highest brix% recorded was 24%. All these can be used for commercial ethanol production. These lines can give up to 56 lit of ethanol per ton of green stalks compared to 45 lit per ton in currently available cultivars. Deploying marker in breeding, more than 40 elite sorghum lines are being introgressed with bmr 6 and bmr 12 sources to reduce the lignin content in the biomass. Designed SNPs with a set of diverse circa 370 hybrid parental lines (both B- and R-lines) helped to short list linked 12 SNPs is now ready for genotyping. Genomic selection in sorghum was done using multi-location phenotyping data together with genotyping data (2,000 informative SNPs covering entire genome) of the training set encompassing ~300 lines. Second year phenotyping data has been generated in 2019 and the data is being analyzed to improve the accuracy and identify the best genomic prediction models. A Sorghum Scientists Field day was organized during February 2019 where the 35 public sector partners and 15 private sector partners were participated, and weâ€™ve shared with them 2500 sorghum lines of their choice.
