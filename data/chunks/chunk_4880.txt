 Blockchain facilitates this by creating a transparent and verifiable record of every transaction and condition encountered during the supply chain. For example, as produce is harvested, key data points such as the date, time, and method of harvest can be recorded on the blockchain. Furthermore, the decentralized nature of blockchain enhances trust in the quality assurance process. Each participant in the supply chain—be it farmers, distributors, retailers, or consumers—has access to the same verified information, thereby reducing disputes and fostering greater collaboration. This transparency not only enhances relationships among stakeholders but also empowers consumers to make informed choices about the produce they purchase. Enhancing traceability from farm- to-fork is another critical benefit of blockchain technology in postharvest management. In addition, the integration of blockchain with IoT devices further strengthens traceability efforts. Radio frequency identification technology (RFID) and IoT sensors for tracing the condition of materials during the transportation, and these models are also able to identify the diseases and rotten fruits and bad quality food materials, humidity, and temperature during the process of food supply chain and helps in correctly identifying the target places. IoT sensors can continuously monitor conditions such as temperature, humidity, and gas levels during storage and transportation. This real-time data can be recorded on the blockchain, providing an additional layer of verification regarding the handling conditions of produce. If conditions deviate from optimal ranges, alerts can be generated, allowing for timely interventions to prevent spoilage. Future trends and emerging technologies Autonomous robots for harvesting and processing: One of the most promising advancements is the development of autonomous robots for harvesting and postharvest processing. These robots are equipped with advanced sensors and artificial intelligence, enabling them to perform complex tasks with precision and efficiency. For example, robotic systems can be programmed to identify ripe fruits based on colour, size, and other visual indicators, significantly reducing labour costs and the risk of damage associated with manual harvesting. Furthermore, autonomous robots can operate continuously, allowing for timely harvesting that minimizes losses due to over ripeness or spoilage. In postharvest processing, robots can automate sorting, grading, and packing, which enhances efficiency and consistency while freeing human workers for higher-value tasks. Use of nano-sensors and quantum computing in monitoring: Nano-sensors, which can detect minute changes in environmental conditions, are being developed to monitor factors such as gas composition, humidity, and temperature at unprecedented levels of sensitivity.
