com Awareness programme at FFP Village Indian Farming 17 October 2023 Plasma agriculture: Pioneering sustainability through a revolutionary agricultural approach Monika Sharma1*, Ashish Kumar2 and Chandresh Guleria1 1DYSPUHF, Nauni, Solan, Himachal Pradesh 173 211 2Rajasthan College of Agriculture, MPUAT, Udaipur, Rajasthan 313 001 As global demand for food production surge and environmental concerns intensify, innovative solutions are required to revolutionize traditional agricultural practices. The present article delves into the cutting-edge concept of plasma agriculture, an emerging field that holds immense promise in addressing key challenges facing modern farming. This article explores the unique properties of plasma, the fourth state of matter, and its application in transforming various facets of agriculture, from seed germination and soil enrichment to pest management and water optimization. By harnessing the power of plasma, this pioneering approach aims to not only enhance crop yields but also mitigate environmental impact by reducing chemical reliance and promoting resource- efficient techniques. Through a comprehensive analysis of its benefits, challenges, and potential impacts, this article sheds light on how plasma farming could pave the way for a more sustainable and resilient future in agriculture. Keywords: Agriculture, Environment, Plasma, Production F ARMING has advanced significantly since the early days of crop cultivation and livestock rearing. Today, technology development has made agriculture a very productive and efficient industry. The demand for food is rising rapidly along with the growth of the global population. By 2050, the United Nations projects that there will be 9.7 billion people on the planet; to feed them, food production must rise by at least 70%. Traditional farming techniques have, however, harmed the environment, particularly through soil erosion, water pollution, and deforestation. Sustainable farming, also known as sustainable agriculture, is an approach to agricultural practices that aims to meet the current needs for food production while preserving and enhancing the environment for future generations. It focuses on achieving a balance between economic viability, social equity, and environmental responsibility. By adopting sustainable farming Indian Farming 73 (10): 17-20; October 2023 practices, farmers can produce food in an environmentally friendly, socially responsible, and economically viable manner. This contributes to preserving natural resources, mitigating climate change, and ensuring food security for present and future generations. A new agricultural method that has emerged to deal with these difficulties is plasma agriculture. Plasma agriculture is being investigated as a strategy to boost crop yields and enhance the quality of agricultural output. The process uses plasma, a highly energetic gas that is created when a gas is ionised.
