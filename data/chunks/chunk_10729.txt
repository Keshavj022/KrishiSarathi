 Bt has been used in the management of diamondback moth on crucifers and vegetables @0.5-1.0 kg/ha. Viral biopesticides of baculovirus group, viz. granulosis viruses (GV) and nuclearpolyhedrosis viruses provided a great scope in plant protection field. Spray of nuclear polyhedrosis viruses (NPV) of Helicoverpa armigera (H) or Spodoptera litura (S) @250 larval equivalents are very effective tools to manage the Helicoverpa sp. or Spodoptera sp. respectively. Verticillium lecanii powder (107cfu/gram) 2.5 kg should be dissolved in 500 lit of water for per hectare and should be sprayed. As liquid (1010-1012 cfu/ml) 1000-1250 ml should be dissolved in 500 lit of water and then sprayed for the management of mites and insects like green hopper, leaf miner, thrips, whitefly, brown hopper and other insects. Beauveria bassiana powder (1×108 cfu/g) 2.5 kg should be dissolved in 500 lit of water for per hectare and should be sprayed. As liquid (1×1010-1×1012 cfu/ml) 1000-1250 ml should be dissolved in monitoring of aphid, jassid, like insects. 1 trap/100 m2 area. Sticky trap blue is for the monitoring of thrips like insects. 1 trap/100 m2 area. Votta T trap is used for Brinjal shoot and fruit borer, Pin moth. For the monitoring 10 traps/ha and for the management 25 traps/ha are used. Pheromone trap is a general tool which is mostly used for lepidopteran insects, it causes damage at larval stages. For the management of adult stage of different species of Lepidoptera insect sex pheromones available in the market can be used. Biological alternative: Use of pest predators and pathogens has also proved to be an effective method of keeping pest problem below ETL. Inundative release of Trichogramma sp. @ 40,000 to 50,000 eggs per/ha, Chelonus blackburni @ 15,000 to 20, 000 per ha, Apanteles sp.@15,000 to 20,000 per ha and Chrysoperla sp.@ 5,000 per ha, after 15 days of sowing and other parasites and predators after 30 days of sowing, can also effectively control pest problem in organic farming . Bio-pesticide: Biopesticides are of plant origin and include plant products like alkaloids, phenolics, terpenoids and some secondary chemicals. They are biologically active against insects, fungi, nematodes affecting their behavior and physiology. Commonly known insecticides are Pyrethrum, Nicotine, Neem, Margosa, Rotenone etc. Trichoderma virideae or T. harazianum or Pseudomonas fluorescence as mulching. Mowing and cutting removes the top growth of weeds. Grazing is another method which helps in reducing weed growth. Organic farmers integrate cultural, biological, mechanical, physical and chemical tactics to manage weeds without synthetic herbicides. Organic standards require rotation of annual crops, meaning that a single crop cannot be grown in the same location without a different, intervening crop.
