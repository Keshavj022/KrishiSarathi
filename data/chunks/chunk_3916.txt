 It may vary from species to species depending on their ecotypes, light, temperature and habit of growth, as per thumb rule, high humidity should be maintained during high temperature. Provisions of forgers or misting units, even humidifiers will ensure adequate humidity. Keeping water bowls or buckets below the orchid benches may improve humidity. Fertilization: Dendrobium orchids are light feeders; they need higher nitrogen (N) and less phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) during the initial two-third of their life before flower initiation. During flower initiation and inflorescence development, plants are fed with less N, more P and K. During blooming time, a low level of N and high levels of P and K are applied. In orchids, foliar application of fertilizer solution is found to produce good plant growth; frequent fertilization in low concentrations is the best way of feeding orchids. More specific fertilizer recommendation is given below. y For young plants (1st year) NPK fertilizer of 20:10:10 composition @ 0.1% should be applied. For this, 1 g fertilizer having N:P:K composition of 20:10:10 should be dissolved in 1 litre water and sprayed well on the plant as foliar and on potting materials as basal application at an interval of 15 days. Also calcium nitrate @ 0.05%, magnesium sulphate @ 0.1%, iron sulphate @ 50 ppm, boric acid @ 50 ppm, zinc sulphate @ 50 ppm should be applied at 60 days interval. For this, 0.5 g calcium nitrate, 1g magnesium sulphate, 0.25 g iron sulphate, 0.28 g boric acid, and 0.22 g zinc sulphate should be dissolved in one litre water and sprayed well on the plant and potting media at an interval of 60 days. y For intermediate growth stage (2nd year onwards, in the month of February to May) N:P:K fertilizer of 10:20:20 composition @ 0.2% should be applied; for this 2 g fertilizer having N:P:K composition as 10:20:20 should be dissolved in one litre water, and sprayed well on the plants and potting materials at an interval of 15 days. Also, calcium nitrate @ 0.05%, magnesium sulphate @ 0.1%, iron sulphate 50 ppm, 50 ppm boric acid and 50 ppm zinc sulphate should be applied at 60 days interval. For this, 0.5 g calcium nitrate, 1g magnesium sulphate, 0.25 g iron sulphate, 0.28 g boric acid and 0.22 g zinc sulphate should be dissolved in one litre water and sprayed well on Dendrobium nobile in full bloom Indian Horticulture 34 the plants and potting materials at an interval of 30 days. y At late growth stages (2nd year onwards in the month of June to September) 20:10:10 NPK should be applied @1 g/litre at an interval of 15 days. Also, calcium nitrate @ 0.05%, magnesium sulphate @ 0.1%, iron sulphate @ 50 ppm , boric acid @ 50 ppm and zinc sulphate @ 50 ppm at 60 days interval should be applied. For this, 0.5 g calcium nitrate, 1 g magnesium sulphate, 0.25 g iron sulphate, 0.28 g boric acid and 0.
