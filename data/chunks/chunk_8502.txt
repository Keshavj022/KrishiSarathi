 The Cry 1 Ac Bt-quant. It is an ELISA kit, which facilitates precise quantification of Cry 1 Ab or Cry 1 Ac, expressed in transgenic plants. The kit is simple, cost-effective and very reliable. Each ELISA plate can be used for 96 samples. It takes 4 hours for completion of one set of ELISA assay. The Cry 1 Ac Bt-detect. This is a dot-blot assay and enables user to detect Bt toxin presence in seeds or in plant tissues. Each kit can be used for 100 samples. The kit is fairly simple and can be used by persons with minimum technical capabilities and with a little training. It takes 2–3 hours for completion of one set of test assay. Bt cotton-testing kits. (a) Transgenic cotton LRA 5166; (b) Bt-express; (c) Cry 1 AC Bt-Quant; (d) Bt-detect (a) (b) (c) (d) DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 42 Sulphur at 60 kg/ha improved seed-cotton yield by 28.9% at Khandwa and 18.2% at Nanded. Crop Protection Thiamethoxam 35 F.S and Poncho 600 F.S as seed dressers effectively controlled sucking pests of cotton up to 45 days. In Sriganganagar, effectiveness remained up to 60 days. Cotton-seed treated with Imidacloprid (Gaucho) 70 WS at 5 g/kg seed protected plants from early attack of cotton leaf curl virus disease through whitefly. Talc-powder formulations of Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf 1 and CHAO strains) as seed treatment at 10 g/kg seed, followed by foliar spray at 0.2%, have been effective in managing bacterial blight, Alternaria leaf spot and grey mildew at Dharwad. SUGARCANE Crop Improvement From the National Hybridization Garden (Coimbatore), 41.35 kg of hybrid fluff of sugarcane was obtained, and has been supplied to different co-ordinating centres for raising seedlings and selection of clones suitable for different agroclimatic zones. Out of 38 clones evaluated, early genotypes CoSi 88033, CoSi 91012, CoC 97061, 91 V 83, CoS 96258 and CoLk 9411 and midlate Co 92020, Co 94019, Co 95012, CoS 94270 and CoLk 9606 have possessed potential for high sugar yield per hectare. Sugarcane CoLk 97169 (early-maturing) and CoLk 9710 (mid-late maturing), have been accepted for Zonal Varietal Trial of the North-west Zone. Sugarcane selections viz., 93-A-21 and CoLk 9216 have been found promising for planting after wheat harvest. Crop Production Sugarcane planting in overlapping cropping system with wheat and berseem in February gave significantly higher cane equivalent yield of 89.8 and 115.6 tonnes/ha l Sugarcane selections 93-A-21 and COLk 9216 showed promise for planting after wheat harvest. l Cane maturants Dinitrocifrol (8 kg/ha) and Triacontanol (5 litres/ha) through irrigation water in the first fortnight of September improved sugarcane juice attributes. l Stain B of sugarcane mosaic virus reduced cane yield significantly in Co Pant 90223, CoS 767 and CoLK 8102. Multipurpose equipment planting sugarcane SUGARCANE MECHANIZATION An improved model of tractor-operated multipurpose sugarcane farming equipment has been developed.
