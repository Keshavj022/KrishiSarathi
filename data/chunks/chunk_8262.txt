 Manjri Naveen, whereas for A18/ 3, a bunch load of 60 bunches/vine giving a yield of 15 t/acre at Pune (10’ × 6’ spacing) and 30 bunches/ vine giving a yield of 12.5 t/acre at Nasik (8’ × 5’ spacing) was optimum. For grape var. Medika (juice purpose), a bunch load of 100/vine (yield 15.2 t/acre) and 70 bunches/vine (yield 16.65 t/acre) under Pune and Nasik condition respectively were found suitable for obtaining fruits suitable for juice preparation. In Kishmish Rozavis White (raisin variety), a bunch load of 80/vine (yield 17.42 t/acre at Pune and 16.36 t/acre at Nashik) at both the locations was optimum. Maximum number of fruits was recorded (76 fruits/ plant) in pomegranate var. Bhagwa due to application of sugarcane bagasse mulch, followed by black and pervious (85 fruits/plant), wheat straw or safflower straw mulches. High-density planting (4m ×1 m) in acid lime budded on Rangpur lime rootstock gave 25 t/ha in second crop as compared to 2.8 t/ha inconventional planting (6m × 6m). Vegetable crops In tomato, drip fertigation with 80 kg K2O/ha in nine splits registered maximum fruit yield (2.38 kg/ plant; 58.17 t/ha), 70% moreover conventional fertilization. However, maximum potassium use efficiency (98.5 kg yield/ kg K2O) was with K fertigation @ 60 kg/ha. The maximum dry matter production (215.53 g/ plant) was recorded with K fertigation at 100 kg/ha. Ornamental crops In gladiolus, Chandani, Punjab Dawn, Rosiebee Red and Purple Flora, were identified as early flowering cultivars for Pune region. In chrysanthemum, spray type cultivars White Queen, Basanti, Ramlal Dada and Sunny were found to be suitable, whereas among pot mums cultivar Liliput is found to be suitable with respect to dwarfness, compactness and good number of flowers per plant. Among standard type, cultivars Thai-Chen-Queen, Pusa Centenary, White Star and Yellow Star were found to be suitable for Pune region. Orchids The scent volatiles emissions of Zygopetalum intermedium flowers was studied using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and a total of 21 scent volatile compounds were identified. Tuber crops Compost (24.66 t/ha) prepared from cassava starch factory solid waste was an alternative to farmyard manure (26.64t/ha), green manuring in situ with cowpea Hydrographs recorded from various treatments against 142.8- mm rainfall CROP MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 65 (27.18t/ha), crop residue incorporation (25.03t/ha), vermincompost (22.15t/ha) and coir pith compost (21.78t/ha), NPK up to75%(26.55t/ha), MgSO4@ 20kg/ ha (27.94 t/ha) and ZnSO@ 12.5 kg/ha (24.44 t/ha). Methodology for cassava acreage estimation by remote sensing and GIS was developed using Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery along with inverse multiquadratic based Possibilisticc-Meansclassifier. At optimized weighted constant for inverse multiquadratic based Possibilistic c-Means for 4 date combination, the total estimated area was found to be 4234.1 and 2175.
