9 q/ha yield in control.As such an increased yield of 189.3% was obtained over control due to application of this ITK. Seedling root dip in turmeric and hing solution was also found very effective where an yield of 169.5 q/ha was recorded with a moderate 35.6% wilted plants during 1997. However, the recommended practice of soil drenching and spraying of 100ppm streptocycline with 3 g of copper oxychloride/litre of water was found to be most effective. But it was a costly proposition to the rural resource poor farmers (Orissa). Mohnaty et al. (2002) 112 Efficacy of Ranbeli (Feronia hyperthusa) bark extract in control of shoot and fruit- borer in brinjal A two-year study conducted in the farmersâ€™ fields of the adopted village of KVK Koraput during 1999 and 2000 showed that spraying of Randeli (Feronia hyperthusa)bark extract at growth and fruiting stage @ 12.5 kg bark soaked in 50 litres of water for 24 hours and diluted to 500 litres/ha (farmers practice) reduced the borer incidence up to 15% and produced 160 q/ha yield as against 195 q/ha obtained from the recommended practice of chemical method of control of fruit and shoot borer in brinjal.Spraying of Endosulphan @ 0.2 % concentration during growth stage followed by spraying of Ranbeli bark extract at fruiting stage produced as much as 180 q/ha yield with 30% increase over the farmers practice with the highest return per rupee spent (Rs 8.6). Although chemical method of pest control produced the highest yield of 195 q/ha but return per rupee spent was less (Rs 4.03). Ranbeli plant is easily available to the tribal farmers as they are abundantly found in the local region (Koraput, Orrisa). Dixit et at. (2002) 184 11 Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry S. No. Title of ITK Details of ITK and rationale Reference 1 Control of diarrhoea by leaves of Strychnos potatorum Approximately 100 g leaves of kantas (Strychnos potatorum) are crushed and soaked in water. This mixture is fed for 3 days to the ailing animals (Dahod, Gujarat). Sitaram (1997) 2 Control of diarrhoea A mixture of asul (Ventilago denticulata) roots and jamun (Syzygium cumini) bark is crushed and given with water to the suffering animal. Cure can be expected within 2-3 days. Asul is a creeper found in hedge rows throughout the year and jamun is a common tree (Bori, Shahera). Dalsukhbhai (1993) 3 Decoction of Soymida febrifuga for diarrhoea remedy Fresh leaves of royan (Soymida febrifuga) are crushed and soaked in water for 1 hr and this concoction 100-150 ml is given to the animal.The animal gets relieved in 24 hr. This remedy has a long history in this region (Shahera, Gujarat). Dalsukhbhai (1993) 4 Treatment of diarrhoea with Ficus hispida Roots of Dedhumari (Ficus hispida) are crushed after washing, soaked in water for 1 hr and filtered through cloth. Between 100 and 200 g of the filtrate is adminstered to the animal. The treatment take effect in a day and completely cured in about 2-3 days.
