 Crop Production Compatibility of groundnut (Virginia 11, Spanish 20) with pearl millet, pigeonpea and castor indicated that its pod yield reduction was more with pigeonpea/castor (43–53%) than with pearl millet (32%). GG 20, B 95 and M 335 groundnut among Virginia types and J 11, VRI 3 and ICGS 44 among Spanish showed lesser reduction in pod yield. Out of the 4 in-situ moisture-conservation techniques, inter-row water harvesting (IRWH), broad-bed furrow (BBF), flat-bed sub soiling (FBSS) and flat-bed for rainfed groundnut, IRWH resulted in the maximum pod yield (1.79 tonnes/ha) along with the highest water-use efficiency (WUE) of 5.65 kg/ha/mm. In groundnut + pigeonpea and groundnut + castor systems, yield and water-use efficiency of groundnut with pigeonpea were higher than castor, owing to better light interception in the former intercropping. Maximum water-use efficiency with added evapotranspiration was 5.45 and 3.35 kg/ha/mm in pigeonpea sole and intercrop pigeonpea at 70% water- deficit replenishment of field capacity. In castor, irrigation at 85% water-deficit replenishment of field capacity gave maximum WUE of 4.74 in sole castor and 3.12 in groundnut + castor. It was closely followed by irrigating at 70% water-deficit replenishment, giving WUE of 4.71 for sole castor and 3.11 for intercrop castor. Thus, irrigation at 70% water-deficit replenishment in groundnut + pigeonpea or groundnut+castor system would result in higher WUE and would also irrigate additional 0.40 hectare with the same amount of irrigation water. Crop Protection The biotic stresses in groundnut were managed more effectively with the IPM package of seed treatment with Carbendazim + trap crops (pearl millet, castor, around the field, and soybean and pigeonpea as intercrop) + insecticide mixture (neem oil 2% + Phosphamidon 0.02% or Endosulfan 0.04%) + pheromone trap (for Helicoverpa armigera, Spodoptera litura and Aproaerema modicella) + 2% neem- leaf extract spray (40 days after sowing), Mancozeb 0.25% + Carbendazim 0.05% (55 DAS), culture filtrate of P.islandicum (70 DAS), weedicide Fluchloralin 1.5 kg a.i./ha + one interculturing (35 DAE) + one hand weeding (30 DAE). Seed treatment with Trichoderma viride at 4g/kg seed, soil application of T. viride at 62.5 kg/ha or castor-cake at 500 kg/ha and intercropping of pearl millet (3 : 1) have been most effective in controlling major fungal diseases of groundnut. l Identified for release groundnut AK 159, Dh 86, JSP 28 and TG 41. l Pod yield reduction in groundnut was found more with intercropping with pigeonpea and castor than pearl millet.
