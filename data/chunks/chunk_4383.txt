 The banana is a versatile fruit for preparing several processed foods November–December 2021 21 through simple processing methods. Monthan Banana is a versatile fruit that is a staple food and cannot be eaten as raw but has to be processed to a range of products such as chips, pickles, jam and squash for value addition and effective utilization and generating income through processing and value addition to the farm family (Table 5). In case of banana sauce, matured green banana jam and green banana pickles, different blanching treatments (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 min.) were considered. However among different treatments, banana jam prepared with 4 min blanching treatment recorded maximum overall sensory score (8.6) with final TSS (69.2ºB) and banana pickles prepared with 2 min. blanching recorded the maximum overall sensory score (8.2), while, banana sauce prepared with 6 min. blanching treatment recorded the maximum sensory score (8.0).

Among all the modules integrated in the model, the horticulture module as the main crop or as the boundary plantation provided higher returns as compared to the others. The horticulture based farming system is capable of providing higher returns and benefits to the farmers along with the nutritional security. The cash flow generated helps in increasing investment in farming which is reflected in improvement in performance of other component also. Integration of horticultural crops provides the diversification, ensures resilience, enhances sustainability and provides great ecological services to the mankind. It ensures food, nutritional security, and gainful employment for farm families besides environmental Table 5.
