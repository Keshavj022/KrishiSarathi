It produces twin seeds but the spikelet bears six stamens and two gynoecia. Castor IC 0621469 17017 Pistillate line, Good combiner. (Ricinus communis) Toria (Brassica IC 0621691 17018 Earliness in maturity and flowering. rapa var. toria) Rice (Oryza sativa) IC 0513420 17019 Rice breeding line tolerant to both vegetative as well as reproductive stage drought stress. Rice IC 0612955, 17020 CMS line/maintaine line with higher rate of medium slender IC 0612956 grain type. Rice IC 0612957, 17021 CMS line/maintainer line with higher rate of stigma exertion. IC 0612958 Long slender grain type. High out crossing rate. Jute (Corchorus IC 0503186 17025 Super fibre wedge length and diameter. olitorius) Jute IC 0503703 17026 Superior bark cross section length. Jute IC 0503297 17027 High number of fibre cells/fibre bundle to new virulent stripe rust pathotypes, 110S119, 238S119, 110S247 and PST mix under greenhouse conditions. Eighty six advanced bulks of wheat were evaluated for seedling resistance to 121R63-1 pathotype of leaf rust, out of which 19 were resistant. Preliminary Disease Screening Nursery consisted of 584 wheat breeding lines were evaluated for adult plant resistance to stripe rust under natural condition at rust hot spot Dhaulakuan. One hundred and fifty one were recorded with infection type (0), 98 (TR-10MR), 72 (5MS- 10MS), 178 (10S-20S), 81 (30S- 40S), 04 (NR=Not recorded). To identify Karnal bunt resistant genotypes, a set of 35 genotypes were inoculated artificially. Of these, 11 genotypes showed less than 5% infection GENETIC RESOURCES DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 23 days to maturity, number of grains/panicle, spikelet fertility and 1000 grain weight during kharif 2016. Further, these lines were also inoculated for screening by different isolates of Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
