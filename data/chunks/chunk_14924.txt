 [59] highlighted the potential of biohydrogen production from wastewater as a sustainable energy alternative. They explored various microbial processes, including dark fermentation, photo- fermentation, and integrated approaches, for hydrogen generation. The study also reviewed different wastewater pretreatment techniques physical, chemical, biological, and mechanical aimed at enhancing biohydrogen yield. Additionally, key operational factors such as pH, temperature, hydraulic retention time, and organic loading rate were analyzed for their impact on hydrogen production. The findings suggest that utilizing wastewater for biohydrogen synthesis can contribute to renewable energy solutions. Nikolic et al. [60] conducted a significant study in the field of sustainability, focusing on the methodology of life cycle sustainability assessment. Their research highlights the need to extend the conventional life cycle assessment (LCA) approach into a more comprehensive framework, known as life cycle sustainability assessment, which plays a vital role in evaluating the sustainability of biohydrogen production. Additionally, Ahmed et al. [61] underscored the importance of economic evaluation in biohydrogen production from biomass, considering both metabolic pathways and environmental sustainability. The study particularly emphasizes electrochemical processes for their high biohydrogen yield, while fermentation and photobiological methods are recognized for their environmental benefits. Osman et al. [62] conducted a comprehensive review examining and evaluating various biohydrogen production methods, including fermentation, biophotolysis, microbial electrolysis cells (MEC), and gasification, from a technological perspective. The study highlighted biohydrogen production from organic waste as a promising renewable energy solution in response to growing global energy demands and climate change challenges. The assessment utilized technological analysis and bibliometric evaluation to explore these production processes. It recommended integrated approaches such as dark and photofermentation, MEC, and the gasification of diverse biowastes. Additionally, bibliometric mapping identified emerging areas of biohydrogen research, including hydrogen production from biomethanol and process modeling, emphasizing their potential for zero-carbon energy generation. In the field of sustainability, focusing on the methodology of Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA). The research underscores the importance of extending the conventional environmental focus of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to encompass a more holistic evaluation through LCSA. This expanded approach is essential for assessing the sustainability dimensions of biohydrogen production [63]. 5. Biomass Flexibility and regional variation The flexibility of pyrolysis as a hydrogen-producing technology is particularly beneficial in India's agricultural landscape due to the country's diverse range of biomass feedstocks.
