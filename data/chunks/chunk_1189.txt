Cabbage aphid Chrysoperla zastrowi arabica 50,000 first instar larvae/ha (weekly release). Weeds Congress grass weed Zygogramma bicolorata Pallister, one adult was found to bring defoliation of a (Parthenium single parthenium plant in 6-8 weeks. Therefore, if releases are to be carried out hysterophorus L.) at this rate, about 0.4. to 0.7 million insects will be required per hectare, as the weed density varies between 40 to 70 plants per square metre. In practice, it is neither possible nor necessary to release so many insects as they are capable of multiplying rapidly. Releases of about 500-1000 beetles can bring about establishment and eventual control.
