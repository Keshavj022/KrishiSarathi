 0 N (N0), 30 kg N/ha (N30), 60 kg N/ha (N60) and 90 kg N/ha (N90). Crop rotation was sorghum-castor on yearly basis. The results showed that CT performed significantly well in terms of maintaining higher sorghum and castor grain pooled yield (12.21 and 7.95 q/ha) as compared to MT (11.27 and 6.76 q/ha). Among the residue levels, application of GL @2 t/ha (12.82 and 7.98 q/ha) and SS @2 t/ha (11.87 and 7.55 q/ha) significantly increased the pooled yield by 21.6 and 22% and 12.6 and 15% as compared to no residue application (10.54 and 6.54 q/ha) in sorghum and castor, respectively. The increase in sorghum grain pooled yield with N applied @30, 60 and 90 kg/ha over control were 54, 81, and 98%, respectively and increase in castor pooled yield with N applied @30, 60 and 90 kg/ha over control were 46, 70 and 91%, accordingly. In case of the sorghum, CT maintained higher SYI compared to MT. The trend in residue application followed: GL>SS=NR. Application of N @90 kg/ha recorded higher SYI followed by N @60 kg/ha. Similarly, in castor, the SYI followed the order: CT>MT; GL>SS>NR; and N @90 kg/ha>60 kg/ha>30 Influence of Pusa Sanjeevni on wheat and rice yield (t/ha) in farmer’s fields at different locations during 2022-23 Location of farmers’ field Wheat grain yield (t ha-1) Rice grain yield (t ha-1) Un-inoculated Control (Rec.

Pusa Sanjeevni ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 123 CLIMATE RESILIENT AGRICULTURE showed the trend as MT>CT; GL>SS>NR, and N @90 kg/ha>60 kg/ha>30 kg/ha>control in different soil depths. Minimum tillage showed significantly higher bacteria count as compared to conventional tillage. Among residue levels, GL and SS significantly increased the bacterial count as compared to no residue application. Similarly, highest increase in bacterial count was observed with N @90 kg/ha.
