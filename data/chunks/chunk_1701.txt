 The scientists have also received many awards and brought laurels to their respective institutions through the projects. In addition to the results in terms of high impact publications, patents and technologies, a strong and sustainable platform for developing scientific capacity and culture that encompasses the extended NARS is being established. Besides this, capacity building of quality human resources has been achieved by enriching the knowledge of >1200 students/ SRF/RA/project staff. This will ensure continuous flow of knowledge, ideas and cohesive working among different stakeholders in the basic, strategic and frontier application research for solving problems in agriculture and also forming policies in agriculture. 5 Summary & Way Forward 80 Annexure I List of total projects funded by National Agricultural Science Fund S.
