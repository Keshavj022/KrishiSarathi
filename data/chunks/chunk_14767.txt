 The success of the ABM approach can be attributed, among other factors, to its ability to incorporate heterogeneous decision heuristics of agents within broader socio-environmental contexts (Patt and Siebenhüner, 2005; Balbi and Giupponi, 2011). Agents are assigned certain charac­ teristics or attributes and rules for behavior that are used to perform actions in a simulated environment (Becu et al., 2003; Hammond, 2015). These characteristics and rules come either from theory, and/or from quantitative or qualitative empirical sets of input data (e.g., household surveys, interviews, and behavioral games) (Robinson et al., 2007; Janssen and Ostrom, 2006). Taken together, ABMs enable theo­ retical, conceptual, and empirical synthesis through a computational tool that bridges micro and macro-level actors and patterns in social-ecological systems (Lippe et al., 2019; Ligmann-Zielinska et al., 2014; Müller et al., 2020). The number of ABM studies that explore the behavior of actors within agricultural systems has been increasing (Kremmydas et al., 2018). ABMs have, for instance, explored food security and rural live­ lihoods (Dobbie et al., 2018), land use and land cover change (d’Aquino et al., 2002; Castella et al., 2005), environment and natural resource management (Bousquet and Le Page, 2004; Kelly et al., 2013; Le Page et al., 2017), smallholder economic vulnerability under environmental change (Acosta-Michlik and Espaldon, 2008), agricultural crop choice (Bharwani et al., 2005; Hu and Beattie, 2019), pest control strategies (Rebaudo and Dangles, 2013) and agricultural technology adoption (Ziervogel et al., 2005; Perello-Moragues et al., 2019). While the published models have harnessed the flexibility and computational ability of ABMs to incorporate more nuanced farmer decision-making in agro-ecological systems, few have compared and tested alternate theories of decision-making using empirical data (Rounsevell et al., 2012; Groeneveld et al., 2017). A notable exception is a study by Janssen and Baggio (2017), who developed an ABM to compare alternative formulations of behavioral theories, such as ratio­ nality, altruism, and collective action, on experimental data of irrigation games. Building on their work, we construct realistic agents whose U. Sanga et al. Journal of Environmental Management 298 (2021) 113353 3 attributes are based on household surveys with geo-spatial data. When developing empirically based ABMs, both a key advantage and an in­ tellectual and methodological challenge, involves capturing the realistic nature, characteristics, and interactions of the agents with each other and with their environment (Rounsevell et al., 2012; Schulze et al., 2017; Smajgl et al., 2011). Our modeling framework addresses this challenge by using socio-economic household data of the agents and satellite-derived environmental data representing agricultural produc­ tion in the area.
