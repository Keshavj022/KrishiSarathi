 However, despite her hard work, Smt Gloria’s annual earnings barely touched ` 30,000, an amount insufficient to support her family and meet their basic needs. The challenges Smt Gloria faced were numerous. Her farming practices were largely unscientific, lacking in proper soil fertility management, water conservation and pest control techniques. The absence of these critical agricultural practices resulted in low productivity and poor yields, leaving Smt Gloria trapped in a cycle of poverty and limited opportunities. The situation was further exacerbated by the degradation of soil quality and the depletion of nutrients, which made farming increasingly unsustainable. Introduction to natural farming The turning point in Smt Gloria’s life came when she was introduced to the concept of natural farming by the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in Kiphire. Recognizing the potential of this farming method to transform the lives of farmers like Smt Gloria, KVK (Kiphire) took the initiative to establish a demonstration unit on her farm. Natural Farming, which emphasizes the use of locally sourced organic inputs and minimal external inputs, offered a ray of hope in the otherwise bleak scenario. Smt Gloria’s initial foray into natural farming was met with skepticism and uncertainty. The concept of farming without chemical fertilizers and pesticides seemed daunting, especially in an environment where these inputs were considered essential for crop growth. However, with the encouragement and technical support of KVK experts, she decided to embrace the change. The road to transformation KVK Kiphire’s intervention was not just limited to providing technical know-how; it also included hands- on training and continuous supervision. Smt Gloria was trained in the preparation of Jeevamrut, a bio-enhancer made from cow dung, cow urine, jaggery, pulse flour Indian Farming 74 (11): 55-57; November 2024 Indian Farming 56 November 2024 Smt. Gloria Sangtam's farm flourishes with the integral components of natural farming and water. This natural concoction, rich in beneficial microorganisms, plays a crucial role in improving soil fertility and enhancing plant growth. Additionally, Smt Gloria was taught the principles of crop rotation, vermicomposting and rhizosphere management – all integral components of natural farming. Armed with this newfound knowledge, she began to implement these practices on her farm. The initial results were modest, but her determination kept her going. She diligently prepared and applied Jeevamrut, rotated her maize and kholar crops, and started producing organic inputs on her farm. With each passing season, the benefits of natural farming became more apparent. Results and Impact The impact of natural farming on Smt. Gloria’s farm was remarkable. By the third cropping season, significant improvements were visible in both crop yield and soil health. Maize cultivation, in particular, saw a 49.17% increase in productivity when grown in rotation with kholar.
