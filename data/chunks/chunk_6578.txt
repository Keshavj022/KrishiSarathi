 The solution In order to enhance the quality seed availability to the farmers and to demonstrate the yield superiority of the newly released wheat variety, VL Gehun 967 was included in the on-going farmer participatory seed production (FPSP)-cum-varietal demonstration programme of the institute in the Tharu tribal villages, Jhankat (N 28°949056°, E 79°791728°) and Nakulia (N 28°58.832’, E 79°42.876’) of Sitarganj (district Udham Singh Nagar, Uttarakhand). The farmers of these villages showed their keen willingness for the FPSP of VL Gehun 967 due to the associated monetary benefits and potential performance of the variety. The application The farmers involved in the participatory seed production were regularly given institutional support in the form of quality seed of the variety, regular monitoring of their fields by the scientific team for a range of seed production activities like weed management, insect and disease management, roughing activities and other on-field training-cum-demonstration activities. Besides, farmers were also trained at the institute to gain technical know-how regarding good agricultural practices as well as for quality seed production. In the process, the new variety is also being disseminated and popularized to the nearby region farmers.
