 The h-index is a metric that aims to measure both the productivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar. It is based on the set of the scientistâ€™s most cited papers and the number of citations that they have received in other publications. Mangi Lal Jat, affiliated with the Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) in New Delhi, emerges as the most prolific author, having published 22 articles focused on climate change in agriculture (Table 2). Following this comprehensive overview of the most productive authors in the field, Table 3 elucidates the major research focuses of these top authors. This table provides insights into the specific domains within climate change and agriculture that have been the primary focus of their academic contributions. The most productive authors were identified from the dataset based on their publication count. Table 2 displays the top 10 most productive authors, including the number of citations each has received and their Hirsch index (h-index). The h-index is determined by the number of papers (N) an author has published that have each been cited at least N times, thus reflecting both productivity and impact. Mangi Lal Jat, from the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) in New Delhi, stands out as the most prolific author, having contributed 22 articles focused on CC in agriculture (Table 2).
