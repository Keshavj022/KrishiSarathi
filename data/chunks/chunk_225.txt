 Per capita net availability of total pulses in India Per capita availability of pulses in India has seen an upward movement during the last two decades although it is still low as compared to the recommendations of ICMR (52g/capita/day). The current per capita availability is estimated at 53.8 g/capita/day which was quite low (35.4 g) in 2010 (Table 2). The current availability is quite significant from nutritional point of view since besides pulses, there are now a number of other options such as milk and milk products, meat, eggs, etc. available to consumers for meeting their daily dietary protein requirement. The progressive trend in per capita availability of pulses is indicated in Table 2. Import-export status The increase in production of pulses is supplemented by declining imports during the last few years. During 2010 to 2015, the pulse import was in the range of 2-5 MMT valuing ` 7500-17,000 crore per annum. The imports reached a peak of 6.66 MMT valuing ` 28,750 crores in 2016-17. During the last five years, an overall declining trend in the import of pulses has been witnessed. The volume of imports fell to the lowest level of around 2.46 MMT in 2020- 21, which is the lowest in the last ten years. During 2022-23 also, import is well within 2.5 MMT (Table 3). India today is a major exporter of various food and agricultural products. Among these, we have seen exponential growth in the pulses export from India in the past few years. The export of pulses from India was around 7.75 lakh tonnes which are worth `5397.85 crores in the year 2022-23 (Table 4). Major exporting crops are chickpeas and lentils to meet the increasing demand in Bangladesh, UAE and Iran. Chickpea contributes 47% of total export mainly to UAE, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Table 4.

This necessitates an annual growth rate of 2.2% requiring a phenomenal shift in research, technology generation, its dissemination, and commercialization along with capacity building in frontier areas of research. Keeping in view the availability of land, population growth pattern and technological developments, five-yearly projections have been made. In every five-year interval, productivity will have to be enhanced by an average of about 80 kg/ha over the previous one to achieve a final productivity rate of 950 kg/ha by the end of 2025 Fig. 1.
