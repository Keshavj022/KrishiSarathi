 pinnatisectum)] with wider genetic base. The hybrid has moderate late blight resistance. (a) GENETIC RESOURCES ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 31 SM/11-120 (INGR 21073): It is highly resistant to both the species of potato cyst nematode (Globodera rostochiensis and Globodera pallida), resistant to late blight (Phytophthora infestans) and showed resistance/ non-preference to white fly. The hybrid has been developed through bi-parental crossing between CP 2379 and Kufri Himalini. Molecular markers data also supported its resistance to PCN as the hybrid showed resistant band for H1 gene specific to G. rostochiensis and Gpa2QTL markers specific to G. pallida. Spices Black pepper: In black pepper, five accessions, viz. Acc 6709, 6611, 6718, 6728, and 6668 accessions were characterized for more dry matter recovery (> 40%). Cardamom: In cardamom IC 349343 is a promising line for high essential oil (9.44%). Ginger: In ginger Acc. 838 had more essential oil (4.3%), gingerol (1.92%) and shogaol (0.55%) content. Turmeric: In turmeric, five germplasm accessions, viz. Acc. 14, 179, 214, 379 and 1545 were characterized for long and bold primary rhizomes. Nutmeg: In nutmeg, Acc. 505, 511, 530, 572, 616 and 625 were observed to be high yielder. Garcinia: In Garcinia, Acc. 10, 13, 14 and 20 were observed to be promising for more productivity and enhanced dry recovery. Fenugreek: A total of three accessions of fenugreek (HM 257, HM 273, HM 293) resistant to powdery mildew and another accession (HM 444) as resistant to both downy and powdery mildew diseases were identified. Coriander: A small seeded, leafy type coriander DH 266 resistant to stem gall disease has been identified. Mushrooms Trait specific germplasm identified: One low spore strain of button mushroom was developed. The yield of the sporeless strain had 65% biological efficiency. Livestock genetic resources Gazette notification of newly registered breeds Gazette Notification provides statutory recognition, thereby becomes important for claiming sovereignty over and protecting our native germplasm. The Gazette notification for the native livestock and poultry breeds was initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India in October 2019. Registered breeds of Rajapalayam, Chippiparia and Mudhol Hound dog; Dharwadi and Manda buffalo were notified by the Government of India [Gazette Notification: Ministry of Agriculture and Farmersâ€™ Welfare, No. 3589 (S.O.4086(E)) (November 13, 2020) and No. 3839 (S.O.4174(E)) (October 8, 2021)].
