2 days, while 40 weeks egg production was 76.3 eggs and egg weight was 45.8 g. The body weight of Aseel hens and cocks at 40 weeks was 1,942 and 3,246 g, respectively. The 40 weeks egg production (22.0 eggs) improved by 4 eggs in this generation. Evaluation of Aseel crosses: Aseel crosses involving Aseel × PD-1, PD-6 or PB-2 were evaluated under intensive system in the farmers’ field in Telangana. At 12 weeks of age, the Aseel cross with PD-1/PD-6 recorded body weight of 1,661 g, while the Aseel cross with PB-2 attained 2,249 g body weight at the same age. Broiler populations: A total of 1,563 good chicks of PB-1 line (S-29) were hatched. Body weight at 4, 5 and 6 weeks was 582, 918 and 1162 g, respectively. Shank length at 5 weeks was 78.8 mm. Improvement in growth performance was observed compared to previous generation. To increase the variability in PB-1 line, a total of 1,467 chicks were hatched (S-0) from eggs brought from Bengaluru centre of AICRP on Poultry Breeding. The body weight at 5 and 6 weeks, and shank length at 5 weeks were 1102, 1404 g and 84.3 mm, respectively. The ASM, egg weight and egg production at 40 weeks, respectively were 171.7 days, 60.9 g and 59.8 eggs. PB-2 line of DPR (S-29) and Bengaluru centre (S-0) were evaluated. Body weight at 4 and 5 weeks were 670 and 951 g, respectively, while shank length and breast angle at 5 weeks were 80.2 mm and 80.7° in PB-2 line (S-0) of Bengaluru centre. Body weight at 5 weeks was 920 g in PB-2 line of DPR (S-29).The age of sexual maturity (ASM) was 184.5 days, which increased compared to the last generation. The 40 weeks egg production in Naked Neck and Dwarf gene lines (S-17) was 78.3 and 51.9 eggs, respectively. Layer populations: Regeneration of the six-layer lines was completed. Three crosses, viz. Kadaknath × IWH, IWF × IWH and IWH × IWF were produced. The 16 weeks body weight increased in IWH, IWI and IWD lines, while it decreased in IWK and layer control compared to their respective previous generations. The ASM reduced significantly in IWH and IWD lines, whereas in other lines, it remained almost stable. The egg weight at 28 weeks increased in IWI and IWK lines, while it deceased in the IWH line. The egg production to 40 weeks showed significant increase in the IWI and IWD lines, while it decreased in IWF line compared to previous generation. AICRP on Poultry Breeding AICRP on Poultry Breeding completed 50 years of research successfully, marking the Golden Jubilee year of the project, in the year 2020. At Mannuthy centre, the egg production of native chickens (S-5) up to 40 weeks was 79 eggs with egg weight of 43.9 g. At Anand centre, the 40 weeks egg production of Ankleshwar (S-2) was 76.38 eggs, while 72 weeks egg production in IWN and IWP strains (S-1) Evaluation of Janapriya, Vanaraja and Gramapriya Janapriya, Vanaraja and Gramapriya varieties were evaluated under intensive system.
