 In institutionalizing research priority setting, monitoring and evaluation (PME) in the National Agricultural Research System (NARS), 25 PME cells (13 in SAUs and 12 in ICAR) have been established. Two web-based networks, one among agricultural economists and the other among agricultural statisticians, have been made operational for information exchange and creating a primary-source dynamic database of economic and social information on the Indian farming situation. In production system research, significant findings include: development of natural dye production technology from safflower petals which provides farmers additional income (60–70%), a package of practices maintaining aflatoxin level in groundnut required by importers and identification of sweet sorghum genotypes for alcohol production under rainfed agro-ecosystem; development of improved technology package for boro rice cultivation and fabrication of a prototype for cotton stick and bur remover to reduce farmers’ drudgery under irrigated agro-ecosystem; popularization of Oryctes rhinoceros control by virus, standardization of technology for broodstock development and feed, and development of a vaccine for the control of duck pasteurollosis under coastal agro-ecosystem. Development of 28 hybrids of different crops with improved quality, high yield and disease resistance; production of cabbage, tomato and chickpea using IPM and without pesticidal sprays; first time report of eight new species of fish; and development of a technology for packing ready-to-eat fish preparations are the major achievements under the mission mode research. Under team of excellence (TOE) mode, developed a user-friendly crop-modelling framework ‘Info Crop’; identified rust-resistance genes in wheat; developed an eco-friendly and value-addition method for use of slaughterhouse by- products for protein recovery (suitable for feeding pets and livestock), and the Immuno-O-Check kit for the detection of passive transfer failure in buffalo calves. In competitive grants programme, 443 projects have been sanctioned. Significant results include: production of viral cDNA to develop transgenic papaya resistant to ring spot virus; identification of microsatellite molecular marker (RM 258) to be linked with fertility-restorer genes for use in basmati rice breeding; presence of nematicidal property in effluents of cassava-based starch factory against root- knot nematode; standardization of large-scale production protocols for medicinal plants, viz. Chlorophytum and Rauvolfia; development of technology for production of fish cakes and sausages; and standardization of protocol for isolation and purification of immuno-protective antigens. In technology assessment and refinement through institution-village linkage programme (IVLP) accomplishments are: 50% increase in number of kids on crossing desi goats with improved buck (Beetal); increase OVERVIEW 9 03-004-01.p65\9\(28.02.03\06.03.
