 To meet the demands of growing population, it is imperative to enhance both the quantity and quality of horticultural produce while considering limited stakeholder values. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into horticultural crop management is essential for optimizing productivity, diagnosing diseases, and enhancing value-addition. AI can help understand domestication events, adaptation processes, yield improvement, pathogen detection, and resilience by rapidly analyzing vast amounts of data from high-throughput sensors, satellite imagery, and climate models. By assimilating diverse data sets, deep learning technologies offer reliable predictive outcomes for complex and uncertain phenomena. The applicability of advanced tools and technologies for significant improvements in horticultural crops and their monitoring through sustainable practices is discussed. These technologies facilitate effective classification and recognition of images of flowers, fruits, and vegetables, as well as phenotypic identification based on various attributes, enhancing productivity and economic returns. Furthermore, they leverage the horticulture industry through automated precision farming, predictive analytics, and supply chain optimization; ultimately promoting resource-efficient and sustainable practices to advance the Horticulture Sector.

Dey and Jai Prakesh H ORTICULTURAL crops are essential for human well-being, as they provide vital nutrients, enhance food diversity, support ecosystem health through biodiversity, and contribute to economic stability and livelihoods through their cultivation and trade. These crops, which include fruits, vegetables, herbal medicines, and ornamental plants, play a crucial role in our daily lives. Effective management is essential to address various external challenges, such as soil quality, water availability, and temperature, which contribute to their high input costs. The cultivation of horticultural crops often relies on experienced labourers for tasks such as pruning, thinning, harvesting, and pest control. Moreover, these crops typically have shorter shelf-life, necessitating specific post-harvest timing and logistics that require specialized knowledge and techniques to maximize their market potential. Therefore, it is imperative to supplement the traditional workforce with technology and mechanization. This transition can be facilitated through smart farming techniques supported by big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, ultimately enhancing horticultural production. The integration of digital horticultural sensors—such as remote sensing technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), thermal and near-infrared cameras, and X-ray imaging— has markedly enhanced data collection from orchards and groves.
