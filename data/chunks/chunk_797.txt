 The benefits of pro- tray nursery include production of pest free quality seedlings, having independent area for each seed, improved seed germination, better root development, minimized seedling mortality and damping off disease, provides uniform, healthy and early maturity, easy handling and cheaper transportation and good main field establishment and crop stand. Since the hybrid seeds are expensive, this method helps to reduce cost by minimizing the seed wastage. Table 1.

Raising of vegetable seedlings under pro-trays A good quality seedling production is very essential for getting higher yield and quality of produce. Vegetable seedling production is a specialized activity and farmers buy the seedlings from the nurseries. The pro-tray nursery is an upcoming technique Indian Farming 21 May 2023 • Treat the seed with bavistin or captan @2.5 g/kg of seed. • One seed per cell is sown and covered with medium. • Coco peat with 300–400% moisture is used and hence no immediate irrigation is required until germination. • After sowing kept the 10 trays one over other for 3 to 6 days, depending on the crops. The entire stack will be covered using polyethylene sheet to ensure conservation of moisture until germination. The stacked trays are spread once the germination commences to avoid etiolation. • The trays then shifted to net house on germination of seedlings and spread over the beds. • The trays are irrigated lightly every day depending upon the prevailing weather conditions by using a fine sprinkling rose can or with hose pipe fitted with rose. • Drenching the trays with fungicides (COC or carbendazim or thiram) as a precautionary measure against seedling mortality is also being done. • The seedling growth should be encouraged by foliar application of water-soluble fertilizers 19:19:19 @3 g/litre on 12 and 20 DAS.
