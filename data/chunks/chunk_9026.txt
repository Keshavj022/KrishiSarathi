4% in these Islands. Broad-bed and furrow system of land manipulation for growing fodder and vegetables in rice fields showed the maximum net returns from Amaranthus-okra- ratoon okra, followed by growing turmeric and fodder as annual crops on the beds. Among the other vegetable sequences, the performance of brinjal-french bean- cowpea, tomato-cowpea-fallow and cowpea-brinjal-fallow was found good. In comparison to different annual crops and vegetable in sequences, performance of rice as sole crop was found below par and recorded net returns of Rs 18,900 only. Fruits In papaya, 25 fruits/plant were recorded in CO 3 followed by 20 fruits/plant in Sunrise Solo, 150 days after planting. Under-utilized fruits, Malayan apple and durian, were collected and planted in the field. Six-year-old sour sop selection planted gave 40 fruits/tree. Vegetables Of the eight varieties of cauliflower, Indam 9803 gave the highest yield (15.83 tonnes/ha), followed by Indam 19 and Indam Early (12.62 and 12.15 tonnes/ha). Among the 10 varieties of ridge gourd, Arka Sujat provided the maximum yield (21 tonnes/ha). Out of Pusa Kiran, Arka Suguna, Indam Green, Kanka Red and Katwa Sag (local) amaranths, Indam Green yielded the highest (20.84 tonnes/ha) during the rainy season. In case of varietal evaluation with 17 varieties, KAU Hybrid 2 brinjal (21.4 tonnes/ha) performed well, followed by CH 157-16-4 1 (20.3 tonnes/ha). Similarly, in case of bacterial wilt-resistance trial with 16 varieties, BB 45 C brinjal (43.94 tonnes/ha) performed well, followed by BB 46 (35.3 tonnes/ha). Maximum yield (tonnes/ha) of green chillies was recorded in Surakta (17.7), followed by PP 977635 (15.2), Pb. Guchhedar (14.62), PP 977122 (14.4) and LCA 334 (13.4). In-vitro flowering and fruiting were induced in tomato from calli generated from leaf explants in Pant 11. MS with 2 mg/litre BAP displayed the best response. Flower buds/explants were 10.8. Maximum pollen fertility was 71.4% (average pollen diameter, 0.52 mm). Fruit setting was recorded within 162 days following self- pollination. In another study, all the varieties produced buds in vitro, earliest being KS118 within 58 days of culture. The experiments conducted to standardize the optimum plant and fertilizer requirement for the intercrops (cucumber, ridge and sponge gourd) grown in interspaces of coconut garden showed that spacing of 100 cm × 45 cm resulted in significantly higher yields than 150 cm × 60 cm. In ridge and sponge gourd spacing of 150 cm × 60 cm resulted in significantly higher yields than 180 cm × 90 cm spacing. In all the three intercrops, an application of 12.5 tonnes FYM along with 50% of the recommended inorganic dose for the intercrop resulted in significantly higher yields. Floriculture Ten species of orchids were collected and catalogued. Species such as Dendrobium crumenatum and D. aphyllum are fragrant with white flowers.
