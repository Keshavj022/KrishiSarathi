Amaranth being susceptible to acidic and alkaline conditions, the soils and waters affected by salts should not be used for its cultivation. Field preparation: Grain amaranth being a small seeded crop requires a fine seed bed for proper seed-soil contact and good germination. For this purpose, soil is turned with a mould board plough prior to onset of rains. This is followed by 2–3 ploughings and plankings on receipt of soaking rains. At the time of sowing, the field must have fine grain structure, adequate moisture and should be free from weeds. Sowing time: In hills, the crop is generally sown in the months of May–June soon after onset of monsoon. However, in plains it can be sown either in rabi (winter) or kharif (summer) season. But, generally it is cultivated in rabi season and is sown in months of October–November. Crop spacing: Sowing the seeds 2 cm deep in rows 45 cm apart with 10–15 cm distance between plants have been observed to give good yields. Thinning/gap filling should be done after 2 weeks of germination to maintain proper plant to plant distance. Seed rate: A seed rate of 1.5 kg/ha is enough for obtaining desired plant stand. If the rains are delayed in kharif and irrigation is not available in time during rabi season, dry sowing can also be done. The seeds will germinate after downpour or as and when irrigation is given. Fertilizer requirement: The crop gives a good response up to fertilizer application of 60:40:20 kg N:P:K /ha. Half of N with full dose of P and K should be given as basal application. The remaining half dose of N can be given after 30 days of sowing. In light soils of Gujarat, additional application of farm yard manure (FYM) @5 tonnes/ha is recommended. In boron deficient soils of Orissa, soil application of boron @1 kg/ha or foliar spray of 0.33% boron increases grain yield by 8–10%. Substitution of 25% N by FYM or neem cake results in higher grain yield as compared to application of chemical fertilizer alone.
