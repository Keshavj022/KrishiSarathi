 The concen- tration of Cd, TCr, and Ni were higher in comparison to their respective background value, indicating their positive Igeo values in almost all the studied sites (Fig. 2). Pb was shown positive Igeo only in the sites S1 and S5. Igeo of Mn was high in the sites S3 and S4 whereas a high Igeo of Zn was recorded. As per Igeo indices, Cd pollution at S3 was classiﬁed ‘heavily to extremely contaminated’ while S1 and S5 were estimated under the category of ‘heavily con- taminated’, and Sites S2 and S4 were under ’low contaminated’ cat- egory. Total Cr concentrations were found to be ‘moderately to heavily contaminated’ (S1, S3, and S5) and ‘moderately contami- Table 1 Potentially toxic metals (mean conc. mg/kg) in the agricultural sites (S1-S5) and control site (C).

The control site (C) taken as the baseline for this study is already evident that the ‘serpentine’ soil have elevated levels of Cr, and Ni in comparison with other geological formations [36]. Plant growing in the vicinity of serpentine rock formations also have elevated concentrations of total Cr [37]. Pearson correla- tion indicated the positive correlation between Cr, Pb, Cd, and Zn, whereas Zn, Ni, and Fe were found signiﬁcantly correlated. The mine processing and chemicals used in mines may be the reasons behind the positive correlation between Pb and Cr [38]. The ecological Risk Index shed light on the differential impact of potentially toxic elements on the ecosystem and is elucidated in Table 3.
