The journey of this transition is delineated by ushering ‘Green Revolution’ in mid-1960s, the ‘Yellow Revolution’ in the early 1990s, the ‘Gene Revolution’ in early 2000s, and the ‘Pulse Revolution’ in the 2010s. India has emerged as world’s largest producer of pulses, pearl millet and cotton, and second best in wheat, rice, groundnut, rapeseed & mustard and sugarcane. In the recent past, it emerged as the largest exporter of rice. In this long journey, several milestones through the organized research have been achieved. The consistent efforts in varietal improvement since 1951 resulted over 5,508 high yielding varieties of all major crops such as rice, wheat, cotton, oilseeds crops, pulses, and sugarcane. These varieties and their matching production and protection technologies have been the hallmarks of the organized research programme in the country. Apart from the miracle variety IR 8 of rice and Sonalika and Kalyansona of wheat during green revolution period, several varieties in different crops like Jaya, Samba Mashuri and Swarna of rice, Lok 1, PBW 343, HD 2329 and HD 2967 of wheat, CSH 9 of Sorghum, JAKI 9218 of Chickpea, ICPL 87119 (Asha) of pigeonpea, IPM 02-3, SML 668 and Virat of mungbean, JS 335 of soybean, LRA 5166 of cotton, JRO 524 of Jute and Co 0238 and Co 86032 of sugarcane emerged as mega varieties in respective crops which revolutionized the Indian Agriculture. The disruption in the form of Bt cotton proved game-changer in 2002.
