 Wheat (cereal) and sugarcane (others) possess the 2nd and 3rd rank contributing gross crop residue amounts of 179.76 MT and 144.36 MT, respectively. Out of all the 28 selected crops, niger (oilseed) produces the lowest gross crop residue (0.0702 MT). The surplus crop residue potential for each crop residue has been estimated with the SRF values from Table 1, using Eq. (2). The annual national surplus crop residue generated from the 28 crops is estimated to be 288.14 MT which is almost 33.15% of the gross crop residue potential. At a crop group level, the highest amount of surplus crop residue is contributed by the cereals (118.233 MT), followed by others (81.64 MT), horticulture (50.44 MT), oilseeds (25.64 MT), and pulses (12.17 MT). At the individual crop levels, the highest and lowest surplus crop residue is produced by sugarcane (66.29 MT) and niger (0.005616 MT), respectively. Table 3 presents the estimated national-level potential of In- dia’s gross and surplus crop residue for the 43 types of crop residues generated from 28 crops for the year 2017–18. The estimated residue potential data from Table 3 are demonstrated in Fig. 3. Among the 43 different crop residue types, the highest gross crop residue is found for rice straw (169.14 MT), followed by wheat straw (149.08 MT) and sugarcane bagasse (125.37 MT). Again, in the case of estimated surplus residue potential, sugar- cane bagasse possesses the highest surplus crop residue (62.68 MT), followed by rice straw (40.59 MT), banana waste (33.23 MT), and wheat straw (25.466 MT). Despite being the 1st two highest gross residue producers at the individual crop level, rice and wheat come 2nd and 3rd in the surplus crop residue list with a production value of 56.60 MT and 38.95 MT, respectively. This shows the highly competing traditional uses of rice and wheat residues (straw, husk, and pod) over other crop residues. The results obtained in the present study can be seen to vary from the previous research. Baruah and Jain (1998) estimated India’s crop residue potential of 539.48 MT from 1994–95. Ravin- dranath et al. (2005) found 626.5 MT of gross residue production from 1996–97, with 325.3 MT of surplus residue available for energy production. They also estimated the projected increase of gross and surplus residues for 2010 up to 840.6 MT and 450.7 MT, respectively. Murali et al. (2007) estimated 511.041 MT/year 3778 T.J. Deka, A.I.

This table provides estimated potential amounts of gross residue, surplus residue, syngas potential, surplus bioenergy potential, syngas energy potential, and syngas energy conversion ratio for each of the 43 crop residues covered in this study.
