IIMB Golden Jubilee Special Article Charting a sustainable future: Transformative policies for India’s energy, agriculture, and transport sectors Haritha Sarangaa,*, Satyajit Roya,y, Sayan Chowdhuryb,yy a Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India b Jagdish Sheth School of Management, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India Received 30 September 2023; revised form 9 January 2024; accepted 28 February 2024; Available online 2 March 2024 Abstract To fulﬁl its commitments towards sustainable development, India is transitioning from fossil fuels to renewables in the energy sector, trying to shift consumption and cropping practices in the agriculture sector, and promoting alternative fuel vehicles in the transport sector. In this study, we analyse the current state of energy, agriculture, and transport policies using the triple bottom line approach and provide a strategic framework that offers a mechanism and a long- term roadmap for a sustainable future by integrating the synergies between these three key sec- tors. Decentralised production and consumption of resources holds the key to economic, envi- ronmental, and social sustainability. © 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Indian Institute of Management Bangalore.
