 Rabbit Meat Products Storage stability of rabbit pickle at ambient temperature revealed that a fairly acceptable rabbit pickle (meat and liver) can be prepared and safely stored for two months. Decontamination of carcass with 1% lactic acid significantly reduced carcass contamination. Sheep and Goat Meat Products Effect of meat particle size on quality attributes of restructured mutton steaks indicated that restructured mutton steaks was better when prepared from minced meat of smaller particle size. W O O L Development of Wool-equine Products Equine fibre collected from the NRCE is classified into different groups according PET FOOD FROM POULTRY PROCESSING WASTES Recycling of poultry processing wastes, constituting about 25 to 35% of live weight, as a valuable source of pet feeding is highly desirable from economic and pollution control view point. Process was standardized for the preparation of poultry by-product meal (PBPM), formulation of PBPM based pet food, and evaluation of its nutritive value and storage stability. Processing of all the inedible broiler by- products, excluding feathers at 1.1kg/cm pressure for 30 min followed by homogenization and oven-drying (70° C; 16 hr) appeared optimum to reduce moisture content of PBPM below 5% without affecting its nutritive value. The PBPM contained 61.7% crude proteins, 26.1% either extract, 3.1% calcium, 1.7% phosphorus, 2.8% FNDB-available lysine, 1.1% methionine and 6.5 kcal gross energy/g. Rectangular pet food biscuits of about 1.5cm thickness prepared from PBPM (15%) in combination with leaker eggs, bakery waste, cereal and cereal by- products, soy flour, permitted food additives, vitamins and mineral mixture had high pepsin digestibility (69.7-71.4%), and were a good source of crude proteins (22.9-23.7%), calcium (0.74-0.77%), phosphorus (0.67-0.70%), available lysine (0.80-0.82%), methionine (0.47-0.51%) and ME (4.17-4.24 kcal/kg). The product remained microbiologically safe without any off-odour throughout the 60 days of ambient (31°C) storage. Feeding 100 g of these foods to adult pet dogs weighing about 10kg could meet 50 to 65% of their daily maintenance requirement for ME, CP, Ca, P, available lysine and methionine. The product was highly palatable to pet dogs without any ill effects. The material cost of production of PBPM based pet foods is Rs 15/kg. LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 123 CAMEL HAIR PRODUCTS Bikaneri breed produces maximum hair yield, followed by Jaisalmeri and Kachchhi breed. When compared to Bikaneri females, males produce more hair yield. Similar trend was observed in Jaisalmeri and Kachchhi breed. Male camel produces more camels hair yield as compared to female. The average hair production for male and female camels was 807.77±18.20 g and 717.24±16.45 g, respectively. Camel aged 3 years produced maximum hair yield followed by 2, 4-6 years, 1 year and above 6 years age group.
