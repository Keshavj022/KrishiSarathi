 There is a need to deploy multi-dimensional approach to address research, operational and industry related issues to benefits farmers and industry. Jagesh K Tiwari*, N Rai, Suresh Reddy Y and Manish K Singh Prospects T omato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is an important vegetable crop for fresh market and processed products (juice, sauce, ketchup, paste, puree, canned fruits). Tomato is a rich source of vitamins A and C, minerals and antioxidants mainly lycopene and beta-carotene, and other compounds like flavonoids, hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. Lycopene is a very powerful antioxidant which prevents cancer. Raw tomato contains only about 20% of lycopene than in cooked tomato. Thus, tomato is considered as functional and protective food for human. In 2022, world tomato production reached to nearly 186.82 million tonnes from total area of 5 million ha with an average productivity of 36.97 t/ha (FAOSTAT 2022). India (20.57 mt, 11.01%) is the second largest producer of tomato after China (64.86 mt, 34.72%). In India, tomato is maximum produced in Andhra Pradesh (19.75 mt) with highest productivity (44.50 t/ha) followed by Madhya Pradesh (24.19 mt). Here, most of tomatoes are consumed as fresh for vegetable purpose, and hardly < 1% is only processed for making processed products compared to the developed countries like Italy (64.02%), Spain (39.41%) and USA (10.34%). Hence, there is a need of suitable varieties for processing purpose. Importantly, tomato genotypes suitable for processing require key parameters such as high TSS (>5 °Brix), minimum sugar:acid ratio (15:1), lycopene (>10 mg/FW), Major tomato processing countries Processed tomatoes (tonnes) viscosity (7-14 Botswick cm/30 sec), low pH (<4.40) and a high colour value (>2) that enhance quality of processed products coupled with less energy consumption at low cost. In addition, other parameters are determinate growth habit, good foliar coverage, concentrated fruit maturity, vine storability, and jointless pedicel for mechanical harvesting. On the other hand, fresh market tomato can be determinate/semi-determinate/indeterminate, moderate TSS (3-4.5°Brix), acidity (0.4-0.5%) and colour (<2). A large number of cultivated and wild species are available worldwide in genebanks. The initial breeding efforts in 1980s have generated processing varieties such as Pusa Ruby, Pusa Gaurav, Roma, Punjab Chhuhara, Arka Ashish, and Arka Ahuti but these varieties do not meet Pusa Ruby Roma Punjab Chhuhara Arka Ashish Arka Ahuti Old tomato varieties bred for processing in India March–April 2023 63 Table 1.
