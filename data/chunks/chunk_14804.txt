ABSTRACT Indian agriculture is labour intensive, mostly subsistence farming, nearly 60% of its population is dependent on farming and most farms are rainfed. On the other hand, American farming is capital intensive, mostly commercial farming less than 3% of its population is dependent on farming and most farms are irrigated. Both countries give subsidies to their farmers but, US subsidies are more than India’s, hence the Doha round dispute. For a number of obvious reasons, the pace and pattern of recent economic development in China and India invite a systematic comparison. It is always interesting to measure and compare the progress of these two great neighbours, comprising a large fraction of the world's poorest people, both having recently launched massive programmes of expansion and development after centuries of foreign domination, chaos and stagnation.
