 39 Interpretation: The above table reveals that the details about the crop wise yield per hectare of major crops from the period 1950-51 to 2021-22. It is found that there is a tremendous increase in the yield of rice that is in the period 1950-51 it was 668kgs/hectare, it has increased to 2,809kgs/hectare in the year 2021-22. Simultaneously the highest yield per hectare achieved by Jute crop and it became 2.5 times approximately from 1950-51 to 2021-22 that is from 1,043kgs per hectare to 2,774kgs/hectare. Comparatively the other major crops, cotton crop is in least position in yield per hectare that is 88kgs/hectare to 445kgs/hectare only. Of course the yield became more than five times, comparatively other crops it is not satisfactory. From the above table out of the ten major crops wheat has got first place to achieve the yield per hectare that is 3,507kgs/hectare.

Interpretation: The above table no 3, discloses the information about the productivity of land in some countries in the year 2020. It is identified that Japan is in first place in productivity of paddy that is 7,161kgs/ hectare. In the same way in the production of paddy, India has done 4,138kgs/ hectare. In case of wheat Germany is in first place of productivity that is 7,819kgs/ hectare. It is also observed that USA is in first place in connection with the maize productivity that is 10,761kgs/ hectare. Another important notable observation is that the highest productivity of sugar cane is achieved by India that is 80,497kgs/ hectare comparatively other countries. Thanks to Agriculture sector in India. Canada has achieved the highest growth of productivity of pulses that is 2,212kgs/ hectare.
