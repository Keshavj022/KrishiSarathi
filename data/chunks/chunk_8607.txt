 The information is provided for different categories of animals both in terms of absolute numbers and standard ruminant livestock units. This package provides information on changing trends in the population of different ruminants in the various states/regions, which is vital as the type of ruminant species has a important bearing on the quantity and quality of feed resources requirements. l Based on the availability of feed resources and the ruminant livestock population in different states it would be possible to formulate production systems that are best suited to match the feed resources against the ruminant population. This would be a valuable tool for policy makers, planners, researchers and implementing agencies for formulating better livestock development activities. Newer Feed Resource and Processing Ricin content in castor-cake varied from 13 mg% in expeller castor-cake to 58% in dust deoiled castor-cake. Autoclaving, heating (100°C for 30 min) and ammonia treatments increased organic matter digestibility. Quantification of ricin in treated cake revealed that chemical methods are superior to physical methods in reducing the toxicity of cake. CATTLE Supplementation of α-tocopherol and ß-carotene in the cow’s diet improves oxidative stability of milk: Supplementation of 1,000 mg dl-tocopheryl acetate and 1,000 mg dl-tocopheryl acetate + 300 mg ß-carotene/cow daily during 120 days of lactation, improved oxidative stability of milk. In non-supplemented group 64% of milk samples were susceptible. Non-susceptible milk samples contained higher α- tocopherol (46.36 vs 36.46 µg/g fat, ß-carotene 4.42 vs 3.83 µg/g fat) and retinal (5.93 vs. 5.10 µg/g fat) than susceptible milk. Leucaena leaf protein–a rich source of bypass protein for ruminants: Leaf-meal from K-8, K-28 and Peru varieties of subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) had mimosine content ranging from 2.94 to 5.56%, 2.54 to 5.56% and 4.06 to 4.19% respectively. The effective degradability of CP was lower in K-28 (34.80%) followed by K-28 (31.61%) and Peru (28.82%). The RDP and UDP values were lower in Peru than that in K-8. The UDP (g/kg LLM) was the highest in K-8 (57.9), medium in K-28 (53.8) and the lowest in Peru (40.2). Nutritional quality of K-28 was the highest followed by K-8 and Peru leaf-meal. Prediction of the bypass protein value of feeds: Effective protein degradability by in sacco method showed that maize gluten-meal had the best bypass protein value followed by cotton seed-cake, soybean-meal, sunflower-meal, Leucaena COMPLETE ECONOMIC RATIONS FROM SUGARCANE Complete diets prepared at the IVRI, Izatnagar, having ammoniated bagasse pith could be successfully fed to adult animals without any adverse effect on intake and digestibility of nutrients. For ammoniation of sugarcane baggasse, 4 weeks incubation with 4% urea at 40% moisture level was the most viable and effective treatment.
