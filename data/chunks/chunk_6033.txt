The green leaves and tops of the plant are used as fodder and as green manure. The husk of the pods and seeds constitutes a valuable cattle feed. Arhar is a good soil-renovator and is used against soil erosion and also as a cover crop. Pigeonpea: An erect, annual or perennial hairy, suffruticose herb or shrub, 0.75 to 4.3 m in height, cultivated nearly throughout India up to an altitude of 1,800 m in the Himalayas. Leaves trifoliolate, leaflets oblong-lanceolate, entire, acute mucronate, sub-coriaceous; flowers yellow, or yellow veined with red or purple, in sparse distinctly peduncled, densely hairy, corymbose racemes, often forming a terminal panicle; pods 5.0-7.5 cm x 0.6-1.25 cm, finely downy, 3-7 seeded; seeds greyish brown, red or pale yellow, often with a small caruncle. Although India is believed to be the native home of pigeonpea or arhar, some doubt exists whether the genus was originally a native of India or of Africa. The absence of any wild or even naturalized form anywhere in the Indian subcontinent, perhaps precludes an Indian origin to this genus. 1192 Use of a mixture of mustard oil, sugar, pulse grains and unripe banana finger to increase milk yield in cows and buffaloes Volume 2, page 332 Mustard, sugar, pulse, banana Banana: Hindi: kela; Kannada: bale; Malayalam: vazha; Sanskrit: kadali, ramMa; Tamil: vazhaiTelugu: arati, anati Banana: Edible banana, plantain Banana: Musa paradisiaca Linn.
