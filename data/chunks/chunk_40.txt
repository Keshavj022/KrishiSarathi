 SUMMARY Surface seeding is a viable option for in-situ management of crop residue. As this technique does not require any costly machines and high-power tractors, it is much economical compared to other residue management approaches. It could be proven as boon to resource poor small and marginal farmers who are otherwise not able to purchase costly machinery to manage crop residues. The adoption of surface seeding practices has the potential to increase the production of wheat and mitigation of heat stress as also registered by the farmers. Efforts are needed to motivate the farmers towards this technology through awareness programmes and demonstrations in farmers’ field. As this is a very young technology, it needs further validation in term of seed rate, fertilizer application, type of soil suited for this technique and quantity of irrigation to be applied, etc. *Corresponding author email: anilkumarhpkv@gmail.com 11 ATARIs for Effective Monitoring AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE (ATARI) Zone State KVK s I ICAR-ATARI-Ludhiana Punjab, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh 72 II ICAR-ATARI-Jodhpur Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi 66 III ICAR-ATARI-Kanpur Uttar Pradesh 89 IV ICAR-ATARI-Patna Bihar, Jharkhand 68 V ICAR-ATARI-Kolkata West Bengal, Odisha, Andaman & Nicobar 59 VI ICAR-ATARI-Guwahati Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim 47 VII ICAR-ATARI-Barapani Tripura, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya 43 VIII ICAR-ATARI-Pune Maharashtra, Gujarat, Goa, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli 82 IX ICAR-ATARI-Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh 82 X ICAR-ATARI-Hyderabad Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry 75 XI ICAR-ATARI-Bengaluru Karnataka, Kerala, Lakshadweep 48 Total 731 1 KVK – 545 Districts (545) 2 KVKs – 93 Districts (186) Proposal for New KVKs: 1102 KVK MSME & MoFPI: 10 KVKs - Incubation centres MoW & CD: 731 KVKs - Nutri garden, Nutri thali, Aaganwadi workers training MeitY: Kisan Sarthi – 731 KVKs NCDC: CBBOs – 61 (56 KVKs + 5 ICAR Institutes) Total FPOs – 117 DADF : 400 KVKs National Honey Board: 100 KVKs to conduct skill training NHB: Promotion and development of Nurseries MOU with National Silk Board: 100 KVKs MOU with MoRD: 150 KVKs, Capacity development of SRLM DA & FW: ATMA convergence – 731 KVKs Oilseeds – 620 KVKs Pulses – 641 KVKs Natural Farming – 425 KVKs RPL – 731 KVKs Skill Development - 400 KVKs Aspirational Districts - 112 Awareness – 731 KVKs DBT: 60 KVKs, engaged in Biotech Kisan Hub Jal Shakti Ministry: 243 KVKs involved CONVERGENCE WITH MINISTRIES AND DEPARTMENTS The wheat sown by this method take about one more week to mature and straw comparatively remain greener than other practices of wheat sown as soil profile remain moist owing to coverage of soil surface with mulch. This technique also saves at least one irrigation in whole season. Surface seeder plants get more nutrition because of more bunches of roots so plants are more vigorous than other practices.
