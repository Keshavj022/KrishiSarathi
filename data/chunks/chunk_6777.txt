Microbial Genetic Resources The total number of microbial holdings in the National Agriculturally Important Microbial Culture Collection (NAIMCC) is 7,789 AIMs including 4,297 fungi, 3,134 bacteria and actinomycetes and 358 cyanobacteria. During 2021-22, 589 microbes including 167 fungi, 411 bacteria including actinomycetes and 11 cyanobacteria were accessioned from different states of the country. During the year 2021-22, 17 new microbial species, viz. Anoxybacillus flavithermus subsp. yunnanesis, Bacillus cytotoxicus, Bradyrhizobium subterraneum, Chryseobacterium daecheongense, Glutamicibacter nicotianae, Lapillicoccus jejuensis, Lysinibacillus macrolides, Mesorhizobium helmanticense, Novosphingobium pokkalii, Orrelladios coreae, Paenibacillus kribbensis, Aseprgillus tabacinus, Bipolaris sorghicola, Fusarium thapsinum, Fusarium fujikuroi, Lichtheimia hyalospora and cyanobacteria Themosynechococcus elongates were accessioned under general deposit category. Besides deposit of microorganisms under General Deposit, NAIMCC also offers a Safe Deposit service for AIMs. In 2021- 22 a total of 26 microbes were accessioned under safe deposition and about ₹7,04,000.00 revenue was generated. About 72 cultures which included 15 fungi, 55 bacteria and 2 cyanobacteria were sold to different stakeholders (academia and companies) earning revenue of ₹2,91,600.00. The NAIMCC also provides soft protection to elite microorganisms possessing unique or novel traits/properties under Microbial Germplasm Registration Service. Insect resources During the period, 17,971 insects were collected Genetic Resources icar annual report 2022-23 85 and curated. A total of 2,16,093 dead insect specimens are being maintained at the National Insect Repository of ICAR-NBAIR. Apart from museum specimens, it maintains (ex-situ conservation) 136 live insects (107 parasitoids, 15 predators, 13 pest insects and one detritivore). These insects are being mass multiplied and supplied to different stakeholders throughout the year. It is one of the largest live insect repository in Asia. The Bureau also has rich repository of entomopathogenic organisms such as Bacillus thuringiensis (304), Pseudomonas spp. (28), Trichoderma spp (24), Paecilomyces lilacinus (6), Beauveria bassiana (64), Metarhizium anisopliae (33), entomopathogenic nematodes (124), baculoviruses (8) and others including culturable gut bacteria (135). One new genera and 10 new species of insects were described.
