 But, AH didn’t show any difference with these two land uses. The sand free mean weight diameter (MWD; mm) varies significantly among the land uses. In the 0–15 cm layer, soils under NF showed highest and MW showed lowest value of sand free MWD (Fig. 2a). In that layer, soils under NF had 42%, 28% and 203% more sand free MWD than AH, RW and MW land use systems, respectively. Interestingly, in the surface (0–15 cm), soils under RW had 137% higher sand free MWD compared with MW system. Similarly, soils under RV system had 27% more sand free MWD than AH land use in the surface layer. In the 15–30 cm layer, soils under RV had highest sand free MWD value that was 17% higher than NF and 64% higher than RW. In this layer no significant differences were found between MW and RW systems and NF and NG land uses in terms of sand free MWD (Fig. 2b). However, soils under RV had 91% more sand free MWD than AH land use. 3.5.

Soils under NF had 84% and 57% more C content within large macroaggregates compared with RW and MW systems, respectively. Organic C concentrations within small macroaggregates were high­ est under NF land use in both layers (Table 5). Soils under NF had ~60% and 133% more C concentration within small macroaggregates than RW and MW systems, respectively, in the surface layer (0–15 cm). In the 15–30 cm layer, soils under NF had 26% and 38% larger small macroaggregate-associated C than RW and RV systems, respectively. However, in the 15–30 cm layer, RW, RV and MW had similar small macroaggregate-associated C concentrations. Fig. 2.
