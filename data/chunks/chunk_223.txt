 In 2015-16, the production of pulses dwindled to 16 million tonnes, falling short of the nation's demand of 22 million tonnes. India was compelled to import 5 million tonnes from other countries to meet the shortfall. In response, the National Food Security Mission â€“ Pulses was initiated with a clear roadmap aimed at attaining self-sufficiency. The undersigned, the then Agriculture Commissioner got the assignment to prepare the roadmap for pulses and further implement throughout the country as a step towards increasing production of pulses. The roadmap prioritized initiatives such as increasing breeder seed production, establishing 150 seed hubs, distributing seed minikits featuring new high-yielding varieties, fortifying seed production infrastructure, conducting large-scale cluster demonstrations, launching seed village programs, establishing Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), and augmenting Minimum Support Prices (MSP). Through the diligent execution of the roadmap outlined under NFSM-Pulses, we have accomplished a significant milestone, achieving a record-breaking pulse production of 26 million tonnes during the 2022-23. This remarkable achievement has propelled the nation closer to attaining self-sufficiency in pulse production, a source of great pride for all involved. Recognizing the pivotal role of pulses, the United Nations designated the year 2016 as the "International Year of Pulses." This initiative aimed to elevate global awareness of the importance of pulses in agriculture and nutrition. In continuation of this effort, World Pulses Day is now celebrated annually on February 10th. This year, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has unveiled the theme "Pulses: Nourishing Soils and People," shedding light on the mutually beneficial relationship between pulses and the soil they inhabit. This theme underscores the critical role pulses play in fostering sustainable agrifood systems by enhancing soil health and promoting environmental resilience. As we observe World Pulses Day 2024, it is an opportune moment to reexamine this symbiotic bond and its profound implications for food security, nutrition, and environmental sustainability. Pulses serve as a catalyst for effecting positive change in our agricultural practices, ensuring a more resilient and secure future for generations to come.

India is the largest producer, processor, importer and consumer of pulses in the world with more than 12 major and minor pulses cultivated over 29-30 million ha.
