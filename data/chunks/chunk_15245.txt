 By processing the information, the system can generate insights into the specific water requirements of different areas within the field With the insights from the data analysis, the precision irrigation system can precisely determine when and where water is needed most. Water can be delivered directly to the plant roots or specific areas with low moisture content, avoiding overwatering, and reducing wastage Automation is a key aspect of precision irrigation. Automated systems can control the water flow and irrigation schedule based on the real-time data from the sensors. This minimizes the need for manual intervention and ensures timely and precise water delivery FIGURE 6: Precision irrigation with real-time sensor feedback.

Customized fertilization: Soil testing helps deter- mine the speciﬁc nutrient needs of crops, allowing farmers to apply fertilizers precisely. Customized fer- tilization ensures that crops receive the right balance of nutrients, which improves plant health, minimizes nutrient leaching, and reduces excessive fertilizer use [48]. iii. Precision irrigation: Employing precision irrigation techniques, as mentioned in the previous response, allows for customized water delivery based on crop requirements and soil moisture levels. Proper irriga- tion management optimizes plant growth and reduces water waste. iv. Selective breeding: Crop breeding programs aim to develop plant varieties with improved resistance to diseases, pests, and environmental stresses. By selec- tively breeding for desirable traits, farmers can cul- tivate healthier and more resilient crops [49]. v. Beneﬁcial microorganisms: The application of ben- eﬁcial microorganisms, such as mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobacteria, can enhance nutrient uptake, improve soil structure, and protect plants from dis- eases [50]. These microorganisms form symbiotic relationships with plants, promoting overall crop health. vi. Natural plant extracts: Some plant extracts have shown potential as natural alternatives to synthetic pesticides. Biopesticides derived from botanical sources can target speciﬁc pests while being less harmful to beneﬁcial insects and the environment. vii. Cover crops and mulching: Planting cover crops or using mulch helps improve soil health, suppress weeds, and reduce erosion. These practices contrib- ute to healthier crop growth by enhancing soil mois- ture retention and nutrient cycling [51]. viii. Crop rotation and diversiﬁcation: Crop rotation involves alternating the planting of different crops in the same ﬁeld over time. This helps break pest cycles, reduce disease buildup, and improve soil fer- tility [52]. Crop diversiﬁcation across the farm also contributes to ecosystem balance and resilience. By combining these customized interventions, farmers can create a comprehensive crop treatment strategy tailored to their speciﬁc agricultural context.
