Gandhijiâ€™s Ethical Principles on Agriculture 2.1. Farmer the Pivotal Person of National Sustainability Farmer is pivotal to agricultural production systems. Gandhiji, influenced by John Ruskin, had a strong opinion that the life of a farmer is the best compared with the lives of persons from other walks and professions of life, for he feeds the human kind through his untiring farming activities. He further reiterates that farmer is the central point of a sustainable rural society. Assembly of several farming families make a rural society; many rural societies make an agricultural ecosystem and numerous such ecosystems make a nation. So, in essence, a farmer is the central point of a nation and its sustainability. The 2000+ year old Tamil literature Thirukkural also has emphasized the importance of farmer as given below: Meaning: those who does farming are the pivotal to the human survival because they support the whole world from their hard produced foods. The modern day concepts also emphasize the importance of farmer in sustaining the food production systems and thus the stability and sustainability of the current and future societies.
