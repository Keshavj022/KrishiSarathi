 Biomass pyrolysis can utilize a variety of biomass, making it versatile for various feedstock sources [64]. 5.1 Agricultural-Based Biomass India stands as an agricultural powerhouse, with a net sown area of approximately 139.3 million hectares (42.4%) out of its total geographical area of 328.7 million hectares. Additionally, 54.6% of India’s workforce is engaged in agriculture and allied sectors, contributing 17.8% to the nation’s Gross Value Added. The total cropping area for major food grains, including rice, wheat, Nutri/coarse cereals, and pulses, spans around 129.34 million hectares, with a net production of 308.65 million tons (Mt). For oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton, and jute/mesta, the respective cropping areas are 28.79, 4.86, 13.01, and 0.67 million hectares, yielding productions of 36.10, 399.25, 35.38, and 9.56 Mt, respectively (Table 1). Maharashtra is Known for producing sugarcane, cotton, and other crops, resulting in considerable agricultural waste. Beyond bolstering the economy, agriculture serves as the primary source of biomass production in India [65]. Rice cultivation occupies the largest share of India’s agricultural area, utilizing 34% of the total cropping land, Wheat, pulses, and maize follow, covering 23%, 22%, and 7% of the total cropped area, respectively [66]. Punjab, Haryana, and Utter Pradesh are the major producers of rice and wheat, these states generate large quantities of crop residues. Oil crops account for 15% of the cultivated land, with soybean, rapeseed, and groundnut being the primary contributors, representing 35%, 22%, and 18% of the oil crop area, respectively. Additionally, miscellaneous oil crops, such as sesame and sunflower seeds, make up 24% of this category. Vegetables, including spices and melons, along with fruits, occupy 7% of the cultivated area. Among fruits, mangoes (37%), bananas (13%), and citrus (12%) dominate in terms of area, while onions (15%), tomatoes (11%), and eggplants (9%) lead among vegetables. Fiber crops, primarily cotton, account for 7% of the cropping area, while starchy roots, dominated by potatoes, use 1–2%. Sugar crops, led by sugarcane, cover 2–3% of the cropping land, while other crops, such as tree nuts, occupy smaller portions of the agricultural area. These crops collectively contribute to India’s growing crop waste, which is estimated to increase at an annual rate of 2.53% [67]. Table 1.

Forest cover in the country is increasing at an annual rate of 0.22%.
