DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 162 Targeting Watershed Research and Development Targeting Watershed Research and Development Targeting Watershed Research and Development Targeting Watershed Research and Development Targeting Watershed Research and Development The patterns of benefits from watersheds vary depending upon the location, size, type, rainfall, implementing agency and people’s participation. Target domains for investment on watershed development and watershed research were decided. Performance of watershed programme was the best in rainfall ranging between 700 and 1,000 mm, jointly implemented by state and central governments, targeted in low and medium income regions, and with effective participation of people.
