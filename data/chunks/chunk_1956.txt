 Increased Productivity: By leveraging data-driven insights and automation, farmers can enhance their decision-making processes. This leads to increased productivity, improved crop quality, and higher yields per acre. Data-Driven Decision-Making: The data collected through precision agriculture tools empowers farmers to make informed decisions. Access to real-time information enhances the ability to respond quickly to changing conditions and optimize farming strategies. Enhanced Sustainability: By minimizing the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and water through targeted application, precision agriculture reduces environmental impact and promotes sustainable farming practices. Precision management of inputs helps preserve soil health, minimize erosion and conserve natural resources. 4.2. Agricultural Robots Agricultural robots often referred to as agri-robots, can play a crucial role in reshaping traditional farming practices. These sophisticated machines are designed to automate various tasks in agriculture, ranging from planting and harvesting to monitoring and maintenance. The use of robots increases productivity, safety, efficiency, quality, and consistency of products. Robots can be much more accurate and precise than humans. Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report Precision agriculture relies on GNSS/NavIC/GPS technology to provide accurate and real-time location data for farming equipment, allowing farmers to navigate their fields precisely. This helps optimize the use of resources such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides. Satellite technology is becoming an invaluable tool in modern agriculture, providing a bird's- eye view of large agricultural landscapes. Remote sensing satellites capture data in various spectra, offering insights into crop health, land use, and environmental conditions. Drones also have many applications for agricultural field surveillance and remote diagnostics of agronomic conditions such as plant and crop diseases, water resources and soil quality. Thus, Integration of remote sensing, satellite imagery and drone technology in agriculture is transforming traditional farming practices into data-driven, precision-based systems. Benefits of Precision Agriculture: Resource Efficiency: Precision agriculture optimizes the use of resources, reducing waste, environmental impact and also results in cost savings for farmers. This includes precise application of fertilizers and pesticides, targeted irrigation, and efficient use of fuel for farming equipment.
