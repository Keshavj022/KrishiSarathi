This study in- cludes 341 pesticides exposed participants and 152 con- trols in three districts of Telangana including 15 farming villages. Blood and urine samples were analysed to deter- mine various pesticide concentrations present in blood in- cluding organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids group of pesticides, and six dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites, in- cluding dimethyl phosphate (DMP), diethyl phosphate (DEP), dimethyl thiophosphate (DMTP), dimethyldithiophosphate (DMDTP), diethylthiophosphate (DETP) and diethyldithio- phosphate (DEDTP) were analysed in urine samples.In ad- dition the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were measured using advanced analytical methods. The data pro- vide information on pesticide proﬁles, exposure biomarkers and the relationship between exposure duration and AChE activity. These study results emphasise the importance and ∗Correspondence author: Dr. Sukesh Narayan Sinha, Division of Food Safety, Indian Council of Medical Research - National Institute of Nutrition, India.
