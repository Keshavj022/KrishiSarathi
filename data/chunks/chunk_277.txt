 It has been shown that single genes in ‘WR 315’ governs resistance to each of the five races (1A, 2, 3, 4, and 5) of the causal organism (Fusarium oxysporum fsp ciceris). Resistance to race 2 in WR 315 is governed by a single recessive gene. The line ‘DBGC 3’ was finally selected in F6 generation based on several distinguishing morphological characters (Table 1). It was put to preliminary yield trial during 2017-18. Based on its performance, it was evaluated in station trials consecutively for two years (2018-19 and 2019-29). Based on its yield advantage over the check variety ‘BG 3043’, the entry was evaluated in AICRP trials for further assessment. Performance of ‘DBGC 3’ in AICRP trials The test genotype ‘DBGC 3’ was tested along with five check varieties consecutively for three years (2020-21, 2021-22 and 2022-23) over 20 locations spread over NEPZ. However, yield data of only 15 locations were accepted as reported in the Annual Reports (2020-21, 2021-22 and 2022-23) of AICRP (Chickpea). The test genotype ‘DBGC 3’ showed an overall yield advantage of 26.9% over ‘PBG 9’ (a desi chickpea variety released in 2021 for NEPZ) (Table 2). Its yield superiority was also 13.20 and 17.29%, respectively over ‘BG 3043’ and ‘GNG 2207’ (ruling varieties of chickpea in NEPZ). Its mean days to 50% flowering (77 days) and maturity duration (129 days) are matching with the check variety ‘BG 3043’. For the remaining checks, it showed some advantage for average days to 50% flowering and days to maturity. It has an excellent grain colour, size and shape, and is likely to fetch consumers’ preference in the NEPZ. Its average 100-seed weight is 21.27 g. Protein, Zn and Fe contents of the ‘DBGC 3’ are comparable with check varieties. Grain yield is weighted mean over 15 locations recorded during 2020- 21 to 2022-23; days to flowering, maturity and 100-seed wt represents weighted mean over 20 locations recorded during the same period; pod/plant and plant height represent the mean of station trials conducted during 2018-19 and 2019-20 at ICAR RCER, Patna; protein content is the mean value analyzed at IIPR, Table 1.
