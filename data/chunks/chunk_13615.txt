 According to Central Ground Water Board, in comparison to other nearby cities, Aligarh city is a typical instance where no other substitute of drinking water is available [4]. Groundwater quality is closely connected to human health, it is critical to examine its possible health risks in a fast-increasing metro­ politan area [5–7]. Groundwater is a major source of freshwater that is used for a variety of activities [8]. Water pollution has an impact not only on hydrology but also on public health [9,10]. A complete human health risk valuation for the implications of water quality in long-run intake is necessary for a complete view on water quality, aside from its influence on the ecosystem [11,12].The likelihood of being exposed to a various water quality component that would affect people, is determined by vulnerability assessment. It ensures human well-being when exposed to an excessive level of potential physico-chemical properties of groundwater [13]. It also directs them to take correct counsel or action in order to clean up the pollution [14,15]. The amount of cations and anions, as well as the proportion of salts in groundwater, exert a substantial impact on the quality of groundwater for irrigation. The many irrigation suitability factors, such as sodium Abbreviations: PRM, pre-monsoon; POM, post-monsoon; MAE, mean absolute error; RMSE, route mean square error; BIS, bureau of Indian standards; WHO, world health organization; WQI, water quality index; WBD, waterborne diseases; HCA, hierarchical cluster analysis. * Corresponding author.

The hydro-geochemical features are important in determining the underlying geological operations involved in the chemical development of groundwater, as well as identifying pollution sources [20]. According to Food and Agriculture Organization, 2017, water quality is intimately connected to human wellbeing. Hence, plays a key role in promoting human health and agricultural output standards [21]. Around 748 million inhabitants in the world still don’t have access to clean drinking water and its commercial demand is anticipated to rise 400% by 2050 [22,23]. Discrepancy in groundwater purity is mostly determined by the physical and chemical characteristics of contaminants, which are modified substantially by natural and/or anthropogenic sources. Groundwater quality is deteriorated due to inappropriate disposal of commercial, municipal waste, fertilizer runoff, depletion and urbani­ zation [24–27].
