 Diversification aims at shifting from one crop/ variety to another and intensification will focus on higher productivity with increased efficiency of inputs. Enhancing productivity through developing high yielding varieties/ hybrids with biotic and abiotic stresses resistance through conventional breeding and biotechnological interventions. Improved agro-techniques includes production and supply of quality seed and planting material, reduced cost of cultivation with efficient resources management including automated fertigation, precision farming techniques, mechanisation and energy management.
