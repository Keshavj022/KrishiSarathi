 The nut is greyish-green with a hard, smooth and shining oleaginous pericarp enclosing a curved white kernel, covered with a thin reddish brown testa. The cashew was introduced into India by the Portuguese in the latter half of the 16th century. It grows wild along the East and West Coasts of South India, as far north as Ratnagiri on the West Coast and Mahanadi delta on the East Coast. It has become acclimatized in south India in the forest regions along West Coast. In South Kanara, it grows extensively in wild state, mixed with mango and other forest trees and shrubs, all along the hill slopes where, owing to poor soil and the exposed situation, it attains a low bush form. It is densely scattered over the low hilly regions of Goa. On East Coast it is abundant in Thanjavur, South Arcot, Chingleput, Nellore, Guntur, Godavari and Visakhapatnam districts. It is planted in Orissa near the coast and has run wild in some parts of the Mahanadi delta.
