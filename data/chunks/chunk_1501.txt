The short growing season, deep roots, and tolerance to hot temperatures and drought conditions make millets climate resilient ready crops. Their ability to thrive in harsh environments ensures they remain a reliable food source, even as climate change brings more unpredictability to our agricultural systems. Major millets grown in India India, Sudan, Niger, Nigeria, and Mali are the leading millet growing countries in the world accounting for 47% of the global area. India, USA, Nigeria, China, and Ethiopia are the leading millet producing countries contributing 53% to global millet production. India stands as the world’s foremost producer of millets. Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh are the leading millet growing states with 83% of the total area. Millets play a crucial role in rainfed agriculture globally. They hold substantial economic importance in rainfed agriculture due to their climate resilience, economic stability, nutritional value, low input costs, crop diversity and growing market demand. For farmers in drought-prone and marginal areas, millets represent a reliable source of income, helping to diversify their revenue streams and mitigate financial risks. With the rise of millet-based value chains and supportive government policies, millets offer significant potential for increasing farmers’ incomes and contributing to rural economic development. Diversification in rainfed agriculture Millets contribute to crop diversification in rainfed areas, aiding in mitigating risks from unpredictable weather and soil conditions. The major ways in which the millets can support in diversification are described. Crop diversification: In rainfed areas, farmers typically grow coarse grains like maize, sorghum, and pearl millet, as well as oilseeds such as castor and groundnut, along with pulses and cotton. Adding millets to this mix offers benefits like short growing season and stress adaptability. Both public and private sectors are developing new varieties of millets, tailored to specific locations and with enhanced resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. The improved millet varieties can boost both profitability and productivity for major and minor millets. Soil health management: Millets serve as an effective tool in soil health management, especially in rainfed agriculture, where maintaining soil quality is essential for long-term productivity. Through their deep roots, organic matter contribution, erosion control, and compatibility with low-input systems, millets not only thrive in challenging conditions but also help regenerate and sustain soil health for future agricultural cycles.
