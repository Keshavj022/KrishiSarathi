 But before suggesting it to the farmers, a research trial was laid out at Teaching farm, College of Agriculture, Purba Burdwan, BCKV to perceive the performance of bananas in this region. Whilst, we adopted GAP, recorded observation on the disease-pest situation and remedial measures were taken timely. Ultimately, we harvested a good yield for the two consecutive years, and the cost-benefit estimated 1:1.50 which gives us the confidence to encourage the farmers of Purba Burdwan for banana cultivation. after planting or in between then replacement of the crop is also possible any time, unlike other fruit crops. Keeping all this in mind, an experiment was undertaken to perceive Full grown banana bunch Indian Horticulture 28 the effect of prevailing weather of Purba Burdwan on banana cultivation. Data recorded on yield performance and B: C ratio was calculated. Additionally, the record was kept on disease and pest appearances and suitable management strategies were adopted. Cultivation procedure Location: The experiment was laid out at the Teaching Farm, College of Agriculture, Burdwan, an extended campus of BCKV. The place lies between Lat: 22.930 N, Long: 88.550 E, and altitude: 36 m MSL. Soil type is loamy sand and pH 7.2. Inside the farm, a comparatively high piece of land about 1000 m2 was selected. The experiment was started in the year 2018. also less. First fruits come after 11 months and then the next crop could be harvested at an interval of 8 months only. The saplings were planted in the month of September just after the rain but the best time of planting is February- March if irrigation facilities are available. It will increase the chance of getting a maximum price from the product as the fruits mature during winter when the demand remains higher than the supply. Land preparation: Before planting, land was deeply ploughed twice at 15 days interval during hot summer and kept open for one month. Then furrows were opened by using a spade and on the ridges, wholes were made at a distance of 1.8m to 1.8m. Wholes were of minimum 1-foot depth and filled with 10 kg vermicompost along with 50 g SSP and 5 gm MOP and 10 gm of granular insecticides. Besides this, during the preparation of the main field, we had applied FYM @ 2 tonnes per 1000 m2 along with Trichoderma and Pseudomonas 1 kg each and 2 quintals of neem cake. Table 1.
