 They were also advised to follow some precautions like restriction of animals for grazing and entry in to dirty and hard places. The animals were examined for healing of the lesions after 7 days . The information to decide recovery rate was collected from the farmers. In another group of 10 animals, parenteral antibiotic together with diclofenac sodium was given once a day for 3 consecutive days. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Tables 1 and 2 depict the results of PRA method. Experiment Data (Table 3) on spontaneous cases of FMD consisting of 4 cattle and 15 buffaloes having foot lesions showed that decoction of babool and jamun has good efficacy to hasten healing of the FMD hoof lesions both in cattle and buffaloes. Majority of the farmers were very happy with the use of ITK , as their animals showed high recovery . Most of them wanted to store the medicine to treat their animals in future. The recovery rate in cases treated with antibiotic and analgesic was lower than that with ITK, perhaps due to lack of local antiseptic application. Two cases treated with antibiotic did not respond to the treatment and developed maggot wound. Oil of turpentine was recommended for their treatment. FMD is a highly contagious viral disease of farm animals , with high morbidity rate and economic losses due to inimical effects on production. There is no specific treatment against causative organism. The standard treatment includes foot and mouth wash by antiseptic solution, anti- inflammatory drugs for treatment of fever and antibiotics to check secondary bacterial infection. In the present experimentation an ITK comprising of application of decoction of babool (Acacia sp.) and jamun bark on hooves, thrice a day showed good efficacy to cure FMD lesions in cattle and buffaloes. CONCLUSION The ITK was found highly cost effective on Table 1.

Farmers considered treatment by ITK to be highly economic.  VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Table 3.
