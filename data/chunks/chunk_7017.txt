 In button mushroom varieties NBS 5-1084 and NBS 5-773, paddy straw mushroom DMRO 1072 and DMRO 995, oyster mushroom strain H3 and shiitake mushroom strain DMRO 327 were recommended for release for commercial cultivation. Livestock improvement: A total of 25,323 Artificial inseminations in Frieswal were carried out from which 4,140 female progenies were born and 1,209 daughters reached the age of first calving. In Avishaan flock of sheep, ewe productivity efficiency (EPE) was 4.22 and 22.90 kg at birth and 3 month of age, respectively. A total of 535 male and 192 female sheep of different breeds were supplied for genetic improvement of farmer’s flock. Improved Jamunapari, Barbari and Jakhrana goats were supplied for genetic improvement programme in farmer’s flock. The overall mean milk yield in 90 days and 140 days was 75.38±1.84 and 111.46±2.99 litre, respectively; and lactation length was 161.04±3.24 days. In Barbari goat, overall mean for 90 days and 140 days milk yield was 60.75±0.85 and 82.55±1.29 litre, respectively; and lactation length was 134.87±1.82 days. At Anand centre of AICRP on Poultry Breeding, the 40 weeks egg production of Ankleshwar (S-2) was 76.38 eggs, while 72 weeks egg production in IWH and IWP strains (S- 1) was 307.2 and 317.5 eggs, respectively. Egg production of IWD and IWK strains (S-8) up to 64 weeks was 226.5 and 218.1 eggs, respectively. A total of 4,19,477 improved chicken germplasm was distributed by different centres in their respective regions/states. CARI-Gracy and CARl- Nirsafed were developed to address issues of climate change for backyard poultry. The dual type hardy birds are efficient egg producers even in intense summer, and also good meat producers. This will help increasing farmers’ income by maximizing production throughout the year. In fisheries, picnic seabream or black seabream (Acanthopugrus berda) has high economic and recreational values, excellent meat quality and ability to tolerate wide variations in environmental conditions. Its breeding and seed production were achieved by induced breeding using salmon-GnRH-analogue hormone. Grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) a high-valued commercial brackishwater fish, was successfully bred under controlled captive conditions for the first time in the country. Technology on carp sperm cryopreservation was field-tested and successfully upscaled for use in improving hatchery seed quality and genetic exchange through field demonstrations. During the year 800 ml of milt from riverine stocks of Indian major carp was cryopreserved and stored in cryobank. In view of the emerging importance of seaweed mariculture, an all-India preliminary site selection survey suitable for seaweed farming was conducted. A total of 1,677 differentially expressed genes were identified in Catla catla through transcriptome analysis. Fourteen differentially expressed regulatory hub genes for growth were also identified.
