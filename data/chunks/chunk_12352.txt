 This is known as ‘Pulse bowl’ of the State. Wilt disease, blue bulls and parasitic weed Cuscuta spp. are the major problems in the Tal area. The Technology   Popularization of HYV of lentil (HUL 57, KLS 218, Pant Lentil 8) and Chickpea (Pusa 547, Pusa 1103).   Promotion of seed treatment with technologies like Rhizobium inoculation, Trichoderma, PSB & VAM.   Foliar spray of 2% urea and micronutrients like Zn and Mo.   Popularization of IPM modules for wilt/rust in lentil and chickpea, and powdery mildew in field pea. State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 70 Impact Covering even 50% of area (say 59,000 ha) under improved technologies in the next five years with an increase in present productivity by 500 kg/ha will result in an additional production of 29,500 tonnes pulses in the State. Area expansion in Pulses Besides rice-fallow there is further scope of increasing pulse area by cropping system manipulation, like mungbean and urdbean as catch crop during summer/spring under cereal- based cropping systems of Bihar, intercropping of short-duration pulses like mungbean, urdbean, cowpea in sugarcane etc. Mungbean with ratooned sugarcane (Zone I) during spring/ summer (irrigated), chickpea or lentil with autumn planted sugarcane and advocating new cropping systems like rice–lentil/chickpea. Intercropping of pigeonpea with maize, raising bund height and planting of pigeonpea on raised bunds during kharif season is other options to raise the pigeonpea production in Zone I, Zone IIIA&B. Strategy 4. Enhancing productivity of Sugarcane-based cropping system (Zone I) Sugarcane in Bihar is highly income generating and a boon for small and marginal farmers. Sugar industry is the largest agro-based industry in Bihar. However, the productivity of the crop in the state is very low (46.0 t/ha). Issues   Cultivation of rejected cane varieties.   Non-availability of quality seed of new varieties.   Low soil organic carbon content.   Non adoption of agronomic and plant protection measures.   Lower mechanization of sugarcane cultivation. Interventions   Promotion of improved sugarcane varieties ‘CoLK 94184’ (Birendra), which has early maturity, high sugar recovery, better rationing, and ability to withstand water logging & drought.   Identification and development of seed villages, cane seed farmers and seed multiplication at sugar mill farms.   Intercropping with remunerative crops like Sugarcane+garlic (1:2), Sugarcane+ potato (1:2), Sugarcane + rajmash (1:2), Sugarcane+ coriander (1:2), Sugarcane+lentil (1:2), Sugarcane + toria (1:2) in autumn planting cane, and Sugarcane+greengram/blackgram in spring planted cane. This system not only provide additional income to the farmers but also improves soil health by improving soil organic carbon.   Mechanization: Sugarcane cultivation is highly labour intensive.
