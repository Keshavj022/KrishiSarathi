Use Cases in Digital Agriculture 9.1. Use Case: Applications of AI and IoT in Cashewnuts farming Source: 1. Dr. Manojkumar Rajagopal, VIT Chennai, India 2. Dr. Bala Murugan MS, VIT Chennai, India 1. Introduction Cashew nuts are one of the most important nuts in the world. The cultivation of cashew is primarily carried out in eight states of India. It is estimated that India produces about 6.74 lakh tonnes of raw cashew nuts every year with an area under cashew of 9.53 lakh ha (2010-11). In terms of production and exports, India ranks third behind Vietnam and Nigeria. The country is the second largest consumer of cashews and also the biggest processor. Currently, around 23% of the world's cashew production comes from India.Cashew is a major source of livelihood for many small and marginal farmers in India, especially in coastal areas. Approximately two million people are involved in cashew cultivation, processing, and marketing directly or indirectly of which over 70% of the cashew area is cultivated by small and marginal farmers, and cashew plays an important role in their development.
