Umiam Soybean-1 (Soybean) A pure selection (PK 1137×Bragg). Erect type, flowering duration of 68–72% days, yield potential 2.6–2.9 t/ha Megha Supreme (Guava) For rainfed subtropics, progeny of Sour type × Red Fleshed Local; upright plant growth, fruit yield 17–19 t/ha; fruit mature 8–12 days earlier at mid hill; pulp creamy white, soft seeded, rich in vitamin C (230–246 mg/100 g) and pectin (1.26–1.37%). Suitable for table and processing purpose. Megha Magenta (Guava) A progeny of Red fleshed × Allahabad Safeda; spreading growth habit; yield potential 11–14 t/ha; fruits medium to big (180–200 g); red pulp and retains the attractive pulp colour in processing. Megha Wonder (Guava) A progeny of Lucknow 49 × Pear Shaped; dropping type, suitable for high density planting; fruit yield 12–15 t/ha.

RESEARCH FOR TRIBAL AND HILL REGIONS DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 135 VL Metallic plough: An animal drawn plough, VL Metallic Plough, was developed which is 1.5 times more efficient than the traditional wooden plough. The plough is environment friendly as it is completely metallic, durable and has adjustments for operator/animal height, angle and depth, fuse bolt. All these reduce drudgery of the operator as well as the draught animal. The fuse bolt provides protection against injury to the draught animal. The plough being metallic is expected to save four mature oak trees during its life span of 6–8 years. Virulence analysis of Magnaporthe oryzae: Virulance analysis of Magnaporthe oryzae showed that an isolate Mo-nhz-09 collected from Mukteshwar (2280 m asl) was the most virulent. This isolate is interesting because it survived at a location where rice is usually not cultivated because of low temperature. Among the 16 races identified, U42-i7-k177-z17-ta513 was the predominant race.
