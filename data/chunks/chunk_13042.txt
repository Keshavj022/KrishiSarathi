 Objectives of the Service The overall objectives of the Service are as follows : (a) to generate a scientific culture and opportunity for continuous professional growth and life-long specialisation without any cons- traint and to promote individual and collective initiative for improving the productivity of research and application of know- ledge in matters relating to all aspects of agriculture; (b) to attract, recruit and train the most promising postgraduates (graduates in the case of engineering and technology) from the universities as may have an aptitude for research in agriculture; (c) to induct proven talent and experience into the Council by direct recruitment of highly qualified scientists on a permanent or a tenurial basis; (d) to promote team work and genuine professional collaboration particularly on an inter-discipjinary basis and to eliminate un- healthy rivalry; (e) to enable a scientist to advance in his/her career while continuing to work on problems relating to a particular crop, animal or area of agricultural study, for an extended period of time; (f) to give explicit recognition to the research management function and to ensure that those desiring and having an aptitude for re- search management and co-ordination responsibilities are able to concentrate on the task of effective planning and implementation of research programmes and of promoting organised co-opera- tion; (g) to develop an effective syetem of career planning, management and advancement; (h) to ensure that interchange of scientists between positions involv- ing research performance and research management responsibi- lities takes place smoothly and reciprocally; (i) to facilitate mobility of scientists from one Institute of the ICAR to another as also from the ICAR to sister organisations like Universities, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre etc.; (j) to facilitate specific scientific attention to the problems of such areas of the country whose potential for agricultural growth is ICAR AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE 5 yet to be conVerted into wealth meaningful to the people. 2. Unique Feature of the Service The Service is designed to replace the current "post-centred" system by a "scientist-centred" system. The most significant feature of the Service is that promotions will be irrespective of occurrence of vacancies, on the basis of rigorous periodic assessment by an external panel of eminent scien- tists beaded by the Chairman, Agricultural Scientists' Recruitment Board. Professional colleagues need not hereafter view each other as potential rivals for a vacancy in a higher salary scale. Apart from providing better opportunities of career advancement, the Service facilitates optimal use of scientific manpower and the desired mobility of scientists.
