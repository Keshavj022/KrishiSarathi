 This volume is aimed to provide easy accessibility to cross-sectoral validated 38 selected promising ITKs covering six thematic areas viz, Rain water management, Soil and water conservation, Pest and disease management, Farm implements, Horticultural crops and Fishery & Animal husbandry. I believe, this publication will be helpful for development and scaling up of appropriate modern technologies blending with validated ITKs. I thank the team of scientists who made efforts in bringing out this valuable publication. Dated: 17th February, 2020 (A.K. Singh) New Delhi  Sr. No. Code No. Title Page No. Foreword iii Preface v 1.
