 NDVI maps from 2009 and 2012 indicated the onset and extent of the drought effect on agricultural areas. According to the findings, the droughts in 2009 (Fig. 14-A) and 2012 (Fig. 14-B) had the greatest impact on agricultural areas (Fig. 14-C) compared to other land use types in the Godavari River Basin (Fig. 14-D). The major portion of the agricultural area covering the sub-basin of Pravara, Upper Godavari, Purna, Penganga, Manjra, Middle Godavari, Maner, Wardha, and Fig. 10. Spatial variation of trend (Fig-A) in drought occurrences based on M–K trend using12-month SPEI over sub-basins of GRB (Fig- B) during a baseline (1981–2019) reference period. K.P. Bharambe et al. Climate Services 32 (2023) 100415 15 northern Wainganga & Pranhita has shown higher drought severity compared to the other areas during these two sever-drought years at GRB. Therefore, the occurrence of drought is well associated with reduced vegetation area and mean NDVI values during these both severe drought years. This also validated the results of drought hazard esti­ mation using SPEI-12 over GRB. However, in the category of severe-to- extreme droughts, 2009 faced a higher frequency of events (28) than in 2012. Therefore, the SPEI computation in 2009 was considered the worst-case scenario for the vulnerability assessment, which was used to determine the most affected sub-basin and highly vulnerable districts. Using the criteria provided in Table 4, the severity of drought hazard was mapped, and the hazard risk map was generated to illustrate the low, medium, high, and very high drought risks for the agricultural sector (crop production and economic loss of the farming community). The results showed that approximately 92% of the GRB area was affected by the drought in 2009. Each sub-basin and district faced risks with different levels of degree of vulnerability, based mostly on the as­ sets directly exposed to the effects of drought, such as crops. Because agriculture is the most impacted sector by droughts in this area, and it is primarily rainfed and mostly dependent on rainfall, we used land-use type as an indicator to analyse the agricultural drought risks. The land-use types were divided into agricultural land and others because Fig. 11. Drought characteristics over the baseline (1981–2019) included past (1981–2010) and present (2011–2019) reference periods. Fig. 12.

K.P. Bharambe et al. Climate Services 32 (2023) 100415 16 whenever there is a drought, the area under agricultural land is at risk. Accordingly, the land-use map was categorised into two categories: risk class, representing the land cover under agriculture; and no risk class, representing the land cover other than agriculture; and they were used to define the exposure risk map.
