The 100% concentration of ammonia provided statistically better control in comparison with other treatments. The 75% and 50% concentrations of ammonia and 100% concentration of urea were statistically equally effective. The treatment differences were highly significant (P<0.01) among the rest of the treatments. On overall basis, all the treatments showed the efficacy or toxicity level as: Phenol>ammonia>2, 5-phenyl phenol>urea>catechol>paracresol> uric acid. Estimation of LDS(| values Probit analysis for the toxicity of different pesticides was undertaken on cabbage aphids (B.brassicae).The estimated probit equation is presented in Table 10 along with log LD50and LD50 values. Table 10 shows that phenol was the most effective pesticide with a LD 50of only 0.703. 2, Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Table 9.
