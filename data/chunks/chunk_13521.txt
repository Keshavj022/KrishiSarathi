Energy Reports 9 (2023) 3771–3786 3.2. Bioenergy production potential from surplus crop residue The heating value of individual crop residues have been col- lected from different sources and are presented in Table 1. The bioenergy potential from the surplus crop residue has been cal- culated using Eq. (3). From the surplus amount of 43 crop residues generated from 28 crops used in this study, an estimated annual total of 4.88 EJ bioenergy potential was available in India for 2017–18. This amount is almost equivalent to 12.67% of India’s primary energy consumption for 2018 (IEA). At the individual crop level, sugarcane produced the highest amount (1152.644 PJ) of surplus reside bioenergy, followed by rice (794.5859 PJ), wheat (660.6783 PJ), banana (536.685 PJ) and so on. Considering crop group level, the highest amount of surplus crop bioen- ergy was contributed by cereals (1890.91 PJ), followed by others (1437.5897 PJ), horticulture (767.887 PJ), oilseeds (580.641 PJ) and pulses (203.309 PJ). The national per capita surplus crop residue bioenergy potential for India in 2017–18 is estimated to be 3607.754 MJ (as per India’s 2018 population data from Worldometer (Worldometer, 2018)). At the state level, Uttar Pradesh has the highest potential for surplus crop residue bioenergy (985.864 PJ), and Chandigarh has the lowest (0.0017 PJ). Other states having high surplus crop residue bioenergy yield are Maharashtra (546.9597 PJ), Madhya Pradesh (435.41 PJ), Rajasthan (333.3566 PJ), Gujarat (319.8713 PJ), Tamil Nadu (251.28 PJ). Assam has the highest surplus crop residue bioenergy within all the northeastern states (70.21 PJ). 3.3. Production potential of syngas and syngas energy from surplus crop residue It can be seen from Section 3.2 that India has around 12.56% available surplus crop residue bioenergy as per the data of 2017– 18. The available bioenergy from the surplus crop residue greatly indicates the possibility of producing other biofuels in the coun- try. One of the most convenient ways of using crop residue for energy production is by gasification. Gasification of the crop residue biomass will produce syngas that can be used in various ways to produce valuable chemicals like methanol (MeOH) or dimethyl ether (DME) or can also be burnt directly to produce energy more efficiently. Here in this study, we have collected the data for the ulti- mate and proximate analysis of the 43 different crop residues that can be used for syngas generation, as shown in Table 2.
