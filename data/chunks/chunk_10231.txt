 1974 CSH 5- High yielding medium maturing kharif sorghum hybrid released. 1976 Two high yielding finger millet varieties Indaf 1 and Indaf 3 containing stress resistance genes from exotic African germplasm. 1977 SSG 59-3, a mega multi-cut forage sorghum variety developed. 1982 WC-C75 variety of pearl millet which occupied 2 Mha and maintained pearl millet production when hybrids became susceptible to downy mildew. 1983 CSH 9- High yielding mega hybrid, covered > 50% of kharif area. Achievements in Field Crops in Independent India 91 Year Milestone 1992 CSH 14- first early maturing sorghum variety released; most popular in Maharashtra and Karnataka; highly suitable for inter-cropping. 1995 Hybrid Mahyco 204 of pearl millet was released which covered 22% area in Maharashtra. 1995 CSH 15R- First rabi sorghum hybrid with good rabi adaptability traits. 1996 CSV 15- Popular dual purpose kharif sorghum variety developed. 1997 CSH 16- Medium maturing kharif sorghum hybrid with grain mold tolerance which has become very popular in farmer fields. 1998 GPU 28- A finger millet variety with broad based resistance for blast and high yield. 2002 Pearl millet Hybrid GHB 558 released that covers 95% area in Gujarat. 2004 Proagro-9444 released and it occupies around 40% of area in Haryana and 5% of area in Rajasthan. 2005 Development and release of CSH 22SS, the first sweet sorghum hybrid which was exploited by many sugar industries for pilot scale ethanol production. 2005 Pearl millet hybrid HHB 67 improved was released. It is a downy mildew resistant version of HHB 67, created through MAS and covers 2% area in Rajasthan and 30% area in Haryana. 2009 CSH24MF- most popular multi-cut forage variety; occupies 40% of forage area in the country. 2012 Earliest maturing Foxtail millet variety SiA 3088 (Surya Nandi) (70-75 days) variety was notified. 2014 QTL for stay-green, a component of terminal drought identified involving M35-1 x B35. Stg2, Stg3 and StgB were prominent in their expression. 2015 PS 1, a partial genetic male sterile line of finger millet was developed from mutagenesis of GPU 28 to facilitate recombination breeding in difficult-to-cross finger millet to evolve heterotic crosses. 2017 CSV33MF-mutant multi-cut forage high yielding variety released. 3.5. Pulses In post-independent India, pulses registered significant progress in production from 8.41 Mt in 1950 to 25.72 Mt in 2021. The more conspicuous growth in the pulse production has been witnessed in recent years marching towards self-sufficiency which could be regarded as protein revolution. The development of nearly 570 high yielding and short- duration varieties insulated against major biotic and abiotic stresses, and increased infusion of quality seeds of such new releases, in spite of area shift from northern to central and southern India, ensured increased production and productivity of protein-rich crops spread over traditional and non-traditional pulse growing areas.
