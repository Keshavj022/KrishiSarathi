Comprehensive strategy to replant in a phased manner with HY hybrids developed at KAU like KeraSree, KeraSoubhagya, Kera Ganga, Laksha Ganga and Ananda Ganga is core theme. Expected yield return is to the tune 120 nuts / palms under good management practices. Comprehensive Coconut Care Package of KAU Soil test based nutrient management plans for the crop as well as the intercrops. The status of major secondary and micronutrient status have to be examined and recommendations are to be formulated. Strategies for improving soil organic matter status and better soil health. Integrated management plans for the system. Encouraging intercrops and mixed crops in scientific manner to effectively harvest the solar radiation. Water saving irrigation and nutrient management plans. Development of comprehensive farming suited to small, marginal and large scale farms. Studies conducted at ORARS, Kayamkulam have revealed that even in the hot spot „root wilt‟ affected areas the yield increased from 14-44 nuts/palm/year. 273 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Domain Actionable points/Strategies Specific technologies available Regions where applicable Strategy 1: Productivity Enhancement Improved aeronaut varieties Improvement of arecanut through evaluation and utilization of genetic resources in the country has resulted in the development of improved varieties, through selection and hybridization. Till date, about 9 improved varieties and two hybrids of arecanut have been released by ICAR-CPCRI for cultivation in India. These include tall, semi-tall and dwarf varieties, suitable for dry kernel yield, tendernut yield as well as dual purpose. Economic aspects: The improved varieties are capable of producing 4.5 tonnes of dry kernel/ha/year. Traditional or local varieties in arecanut yield up to 2600 kg dry kernel/ha/year. Improved varieties have the potential to give yield up to 5200 kg/ ha/year of dry kernel. By cultivating improved varieties, farmer can realise an additional 2000 kg dry kernel/ha/ year (about 80% increases in production). At the present value of Rs. 2,00,000/- per tonne of dry kernel, the additional income is approximately Rs. 5.0 lakhs per annum per hectare. (180-190% increase in income).
