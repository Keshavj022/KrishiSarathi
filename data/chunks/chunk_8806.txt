Lr 9 virulence was recorded in only 3 samples from Nilgiri hills, indicating not much development of this. Pathotype 104-2 (21R55) carrying virulence for Lr 23 and Lr 26 was frequent in durum and dicoccum wheat areas. In the northern India, there was predominance of 104-2 and 77A, followed by 77-5. HEAD SCAB - A POSSIBLE PROBLEM OF FUTURE WHEAT Head scab may become serious with spells of wet weather (warm and humid) at crop anthesis. Such a weather may frequently occur as a consequence of global warming and change in rainfall pattern. Head scab infected samples of wheat were collected from different locations in hills and foot hills. Five Fusarium spp. (F. graminearum, F. oxysporum, F. equiseti, F. moniliforme and F. solani) have been isolated, purified and identified. A set of differentials has been constituted.

Metsulfuron at 4.0 g/ha and Chlorsulfuron at 25g/ha were effective against the broadleaf weeds. In zero tillage, P. minor population was lesser as compared to conventional because seeds lying in lower layers do not come up in the upper layer. Intensification of rice-wheat system by including short-duration vegetable pea or potato, followed by late wheat effectively controlled weed without herbicide application.
