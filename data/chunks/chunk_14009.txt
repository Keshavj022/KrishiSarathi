It is created by the PCA from eight aspects of social behaviour on a 5- point Likert scale (for the technical aspect of PCA, see Kumar et al., 2007). The PCA-generated SCI is then standardized so that 0  SCI 1. The aspects include the frequency of mobile use, attending social, cultural, religious, economic, and political meeting(s), watching television in a group and visiting relatives in the household.

Residing in a permanent structure, 2. Access to toilet facilities 3. Access to bathing facilities 4. Access to puriﬁed drinking water 5. Frequency of using soap for bathing6. Use of disinfectant to clean bathroom, toilet, and surfaces, 7.use of hand wash, and 8. Use of detergent to clean utensils. Ratio: The LSI is calculated by using the method WAM (the weights being uniform) and is deﬁned as: LSI ¼ P8 1Ii 8 . Possession of an indicator by the household is assigned the value “1”, and non-possession of the indicator is “0”. The household having all the indicators will have LSI ¼ 1, and having no indicators will have LSI ¼ 0. Thus, the value of LSI will lie between 0 and 1, i.e., 0 < LSI < 1.

The variables to be considered are total health expenditure, total education expenditure, and total income, which includes income from primary and secondary occupations over the past year. Dimension indices (DI) for health, education, and income are calculated by selecting minimum and maximum values as goalposts.
