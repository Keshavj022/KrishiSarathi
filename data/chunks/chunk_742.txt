 Therefore, new adapted cultivars and technologies were deployed to fit into the changed scenarios with respect to changing climate and natural resource degradation for tackling triple challenges of resource fatigue, decelerating productivity growth in cereal crops and farmers’ profitability. Wheat sowing through Happy Seeder in paddy harvested field Science based evidences have been collected in the western IGP on cereal based systems for more than 5 years with continued cultivation with CSA on the different parameters from large number of multi-location trials. The results showed that CSA-based rice-wheat- mungbean (RWMb) systems improved the system productivity by 8–12%, profitability by 18–23% using 20– 25% less irrigation water and ~20–23% less energy input compared to conventional RW system/farmers practice while reducing the global warming potential (GWP) by ~25% (1.5 Mg CO2 eq/yr). Whereas, CSA-based maize– wheat–mungbean (MWMb) systems on flats improved productivity by 10–20% and profitability by 40–50% using 70–80% less irrigation water, and 45–50% energy input compared to conventional RW system/farmers, practice while reducing the GWP by 30%. In maize based system, permanent beds doubled the advantage over ZT-flat system. The productivity was improved by ~10 with 10% more saving in irrigation water compared to flat system. CSA-based cereal systems improved the soil organic carbon by 80–100% and available NPK by 30, 30, 50%, respectively compared to conventional RW system. Therefore, 30% and 50% of N and K fertilizers can be saved after 5 years of continuous cultivation. Precise management of N fertilizer through subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) saved 20% of nitrogenous fertilizer in both rice and maize based systems with same or even higher yields. SDI saved 40-50% of irrigation water and increased irrigation water productivity (WPI) by >100% compared to farmers’ practice. However, maize- wheat system recorded 10% higher system productivity (rice equivalents), saved 80% of irrigation water and increased WPI by many folds compared to conventional RW system. For sustainable intensification, integration Indian Farming 55 June 2023 of mungbean in RW and MW system contributes ~15% increase in both system productivity and profitability. CSA-based sustainable intensification helped in mitigating the negative effects of terminal heat stress on wheat and increased the wheat yields by 0.7–0.8 t/ha than conventional till wheat. Crop residue retention reduces the Phalaris minor problem considerably (up to 75%) in wheat crop and also reduces environmental pollution by managing the crop residue insitu using Happy Seeder. Replacement of PTR with ZT-DSR and ZT-maize in RW system reduced GWP by 30–50 and 40%, respectively. On system basis, CSA based management reduced the GWP by ~25% in both rice and maize based systems. crop residues on soil surface. Happy Seeder technology provided a yield advantage of 0.10–0.
