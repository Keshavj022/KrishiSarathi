It can be seen from the table that the best germinating rates for peels decomposed for 2 months were obtained from peels in a soil medium. For peels used after 4 months of decomposition, the BP decomposed in water and its leachate had similar germination rates; however, they were higher than that of peels decomposed in soil (Table 4). The overall highest germinating rate (~94.59%) was obtained from peels decomposed for 6 months in water. Interestingly, the peels without decomposition were shown to have high germinating rates compared with some of the decomposed peels. The peels decomposed in soil yielded higher plant heights than all other mediums; 75 cm after 90 days of planting. This observation is supported by the work of Frink et al. [66], who established that the nutrients available in organic fertilizers are best liberated after decomposition for extended periods. However, in the work of El Barnossi et al. [61], the growth of the plant height was least improved after extended periods, since it decreased with an increase in decomposition time. The authors found that the best decomposition period of BP for crop growth is two months in a soil medium. However, peels can also used without decomposition, as these showed good germination rates and plant heights. Table 4.

These materials include eggshell powder, wood ash, fruit and vegetable leaves, etc. In one such study by Wazir et al. [62], the materials investigated included tea waste and banana peel powder. The BPs were dried in the sun, cut into small pieces of ~1 cm3, and 20 g of the resulting dried peel powder was mixed with pot soil (4 kg).
