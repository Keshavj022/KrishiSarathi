 1952 ICAR-Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research (IISR) was established at Lucknow. 1962 Establishment of world sugarcane germplasm collection centre at Kannur, Kerala. 1967 Sugarcane variety Co 1148 developed, ruled north India for 40 years and occupied 80% area in subtropics during the mid-1970s and 1980s. 1974 National Hybridization Garden (NHG) on sugarcane established at Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. 1999 Establishment of National Distant Hybridization Garden facility, Agali, Kerala. 2000 Variety Co 86032 released which occupied more than 1.0 Mha in the peninsular zone. 2009 Variety Co 0238 released, which occupied more than 2.79 Mha in north India. 2020 Government permitted for direct fermentation of sugarcane juice for bioethanol production. 3.8. Cotton In India, cotton is cultivated on about 13.0 Mha area with the production of about 37 million bales (about 6.3 million tons). India accounts about 36-38% of the global cotton acreage and 25% of production. More than a third of the world’s fabric needs and over 60% of clothing demand in India are met by cotton. Cotton provides 59% of raw material to the textile industry and comprises 29.1% of total textile exports. Cotton contributes 4.9% to the value of agricultural output while the textile industry contributes about 4% to the GDP. In terms of exports, raw cotton is exported to the tune of 50-70 lakh bales while the textile industry is the largest exporter of cotton yarn (26.7%). By 2030, India’s projected cotton lint requirement is 8.95 Mt @ 47 metre cloth per capita. At present, 6 million tons of cotton lint is available @ 34-meter cloth per capita. In order to meet the projected demand by 2030, the average productivity of cotton is to be increased to 746 kg lint/ha from the present ~450 kg lint ha-1. India is unique in terms of growing all the four cultivated species of cotton (desi diploid cottons - Gossypium arboreum and G. herbaceum), the American upland cotton (G. hirsutum), and the Egyptian extra-long-staple cotton (G. barbadense). The systematic research on cotton was initiated in 1967 under AICRP cotton. So far 385 cotton varieties and hybrids recommended for commercial cultivation in different cotton growing zones. Among them, 269 are varieties (176 hirsutum, 68 arboreum, 21 herbaceum and 4 barbadense varieties) and 110 are hybrids (70 intra-specific hirsutum hybrids, 19 inter- specific and 21 diploid hybrids.
