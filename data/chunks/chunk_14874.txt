12 mm) may be due to higher SOC (27.47 ± 0.21 g kg−1 in the forest and 17.98 ± 0.07 g kg−1 in CA), root-induced physical entanglement of aggregates, increased root exudates, and reinforcement of soil particle contact due to better root growth (Parihar et al., 2016; Patra et al., 2019b). A similar finding of higher MWD in CA compared to CT was also observed by several other researchers (Govaerts et al., 2009; Kan et al., 2020; Parihar et al., 2020; Nyambo et al., 2022), and the attributing cause was mini­ mum soil disturbance, increased earthworm activity, and higher SOC leading to higher abundance of macro aggregates. Converting virgin forest land to conventional tillage practices reduced soil aggregate sta­ bility significantly, and it was restored near to its original level by adopting conservation agricultural practices. The depth-wise SOC (g kg−1) distribution among different land uses presented in Fig. 4 (A). The surface soil (0–5 cm) SOC was significantly different from each other, with forest soil having the highest SOC (27.47 ± 0.21) and CT having the lowest SOC (11.00 ± 0.09). The SOC in the topsoil layer followed the trend; forest > ZT > RT > CT. The SOC varied Fig. 2. Soil bulk density depth variation under various land use patterns (Forest, ZT, RT, and CT). The bars present mean ± SD (m = 3). The different uppercase alphabets imply significant differences across treatments for a given soil depth, and the lowercase alphabets imply significant differences across the soil depths for a given treatment (P < 0.05).

The SOC content of the topsoil layer significantly varied from subsequent subsoil layers in forest, ZT, and RT; however no significant variation among soil depths beyond 5 cm. In the case of CT, there was no significant variation throughout the soil depth. There was no significant variation in SOC among treatments beyond 15 cm of soil depth. The SOC decreased with soil depth for all treatments, and similar results with forest land having higher SOC compared to agricultural land were also reported by several other re­ searchers (Xu et al., 2017; Chao et al., 2019). The better MWD due to lesser soil disturbance is mainly responsible for the higher SOC (Liu et al., 2020) in forest and conservation agriculture land uses compared to conventional tillage land uses. Tillage leads to surface soil distur­ bance, erosion, and SOC mixing, as in the case of CT, and the soil health gradually improves toward conservation agriculture and forest land use due to less soil disturbance, higher residue retention, litter addition, and slowing down of SOC mineralization (Patra et al., 2019a; Kabir et al., 2020; Kan et al., 2020).
