 After a moderate growth in 1970s, the national funding grew more than 6% per annum during 1980s, which was sustained during the 1990s and thereafter. Thus, the growth was nearly 6% since 1980s, almost doubling the real investment in each decade. The annual real funding for research and education at 2011 prices during the triennium ending (TE) 2014 was ` 86.68 billion and nearly half of this funding was from the states. If we take research funding net of education, the national funding was ` 53.38 billion. Much of the growth in the funding was since late 1990s, mainly because of higher funding from the central government. For international comparison, funding or expenditure is expressed in purchasing power parity (PPP) or international dollar rather than in US dollar (or any reference currency) using the nominal exchange rate, and PPP conversion rate takes into consideration prices of a bundle of goods and services in both the countries, India and US in this case with a reference year 2011. In 2011 PPP dollars, research funding stands at 3,533 million during 2011-14, as against 1,905 million during 2001-03 and 1,034 million in 1991-93. The highest investment was about 4,000 PPP dollars in 2011, indicating that there is near doubling of public funding in real terms in each decade. This trend however, could SOCIAL SCIENCE DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 101 not be sustained during the last few years. In terms of research intensity, funding or expenditure as percentage of AgGDP, India spent only 0.40% of AgGDP on research during 2012-14 and it has been at this level since 2001, except in 2011 where it reached to 0.52% because of higher plan allocations of the Union Government. The expenditure intensity was 1.8% in Brazil, 0.5% in China and 3.01% in the high income or developed countries. This gap in the expenditure intensity in India and other countries of comparable size was much higher during the 1980s and early 1990s, which narrowed down subsequently due to higher funding coming after the mid-1990s. The present trend is likely to continue as the government intends to reach the research intensity of 1% of AgGDP, which shall bring India close to the funding level of China and Latin America. But the trend in last couple of years indicated slow down in the public expenditure, which must be reversed. Higher allocation of public fund and well qualified scientific manpower will strengthen India’s position as a major provider of agricultural R&D services globally. Management system for post graduate education: The Management System for Post Graduate Education, initially designed by IASRI and implemented for IARI, was enhanced to meet the additional requirements of outreach program of IARI, CIFE, NDRI and CAU. System enables automation and streamlining of all the academic activities of a university and builds a repository of the academic records and e-learning resources.
