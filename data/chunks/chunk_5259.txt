53 occurrence (after 2 weeks) Usefulness of the method 5.88  METHODS OF WEATHER FORECASTING Experiment Spider webs in orchards, bamboo fields and huts were surveyed and studied for their orientation before and after the onset of monsoon. Data generated out of this case study are presented in Table 2. Data presented in Table 2 reveal that percentage of vertically oriented spider webs increased with the passage of time from dry season ( pre - monsoon ) to the onset of monsoon and remained at higher percentage in the monsoon season. Reverse trend was found in the Table 2. Orientation of spider webs before and after onset of monsoon (monsoon breaking on 21 June 2003) Monsoon status Date of Spider webs Horizontally oriented Vertically observation surveyed/studied webs oriented webs No. % No. % Pre-monsoon 9 June 2003 38 35 92.1 37.9 11 June 2003 25 15 60.0 10 40.0 15 June 2003 75 5 6.7 70 93.3 18 June 2003 52 3 5.8 49 94.2 During monsoon Monsoon broke on June 21 2003 23 June 2003 87 2 2.3 85 97.7 29 June 2003 19 1 5.3 18 94.7 5 July 2003 34 5 14.7 29 85.3 20 August 2003 11 4 36.4 76 3.6 7 September 2003 47 3 6.4 44 93.6 horizontally oriented webs. Based on this it was inferred that the vertical orientation of the majority of the spider webs can be taken as an indication of monsoon onset. CONCLUSION Based on the field/case study the ITK was found valid to be used for the forecasting of onset of the monsoon, as most of the surveyed spider webs (just before the monsoon and within the season) were found vertically oriented.  LOW COST HOUSING MATERIALS Code : 579 Thematic area : Low cost housing material Title of the ITK : Validation of wood and stone houses- a case study Description of the ITK : The ITK is practiced in Uttarkashi district. In this area the houses are built using wood and stone and are supposed to be earthquake proof. The wooden logs are placed in between the wall (after every one feet of stone wall). Roof also is made of wood. These houses are earthquake proof and provide good insulation against cold climate.

Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Ranichauri, Tehri Garhwal, Uttaranchal METHODOLOGY Location Evaluation of traditional method of constructing houses against resistance to earthquake was made by a case study done in the villages of Uttarkasi and Chamoli districts which experienced devastating earthquake in 1991. Extent and coverage Uttaranchal hills are earthquake prone which results in heavy casualties.
