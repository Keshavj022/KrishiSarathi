 Under WTO obligations, it is difficult to check such temporary imports and shocks through quantitative restrictions (QRs). There is a need for alertness to impose appropriate tariffs to regulate unwanted imports. Demand for Livestock Products in India Consumption of livestock products in India has been increasing over the past 20 years. Sustained economic growth and attendant increase in per capita incomes are expected to further boost livestock product demand substantially. Demand for livestock products for the year 2020 was estimated on the basis of the actual consumption in the year 1993. The expenditure elasticity of livestock products is high particularly in rural areas compared to urban areas implying thereby acceleration in demand for livestock products in rural areas with rising per capita incomes. Further, the expenditure elasticity of livestock products is higher than elasticity of other food expenditures. This implies that there would be a shift in consumption pattern towards livestock products. This is evident from the demand projections for 2020. Demand for milk and meat is estimated to be 147 and 14 million tonnes, respectively. Sustainability Implications of Tank Irrigation in Andhra Pradesh Tank irrigation system infrastructure in south India is continuously deteriorating, which has equity and sustainability implications. For instance, for Andhra Pradesh as a whole, gap Ayacut (no irrigation) and stabilization areas (partial irrigation) constitute 2/3rd of the registered Ayacut in the 90’s. Within the state, only 1/5th to 1/3rd of registered ayacut gets assured irrigation in Rayalseema and Telengana regions. These regions are drought prone; account for 4/5ths of the mandals with more than 85% groundwater exploitation; highlighting the sustainability implications of deteriorating tank irrigation infrastructure. Notably, farms in tank irrigated command are predominantly small in size; 40% in less than 0.5 ha category, 60% in less than 1 ha size and 80% in less than 2 ha size, highlighting the equity implications of deteriorating tank irrigation infrastructure. Currently, loss in tank irrigated area has reached around 1/4th of the net irrigated area in the state.

Aggregate Level Priority Setting for Optimum Resource Allocation An attempt was made to allocate research resources more objectively across agro-ecoregions and production systems.
