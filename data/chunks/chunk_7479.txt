 A map showing district level inequalities in the distribution of food insecure households in Uttar Pradesh was also produced which provided an important information for analysis of spatial distribution of food Spatial distribution of incidence of food insecurity by districts in rural area of Uttar Pradesh ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 133 SOCIAL SCIENCE to construct an incomplete split plot designs for three situations namely (i) when blocks are complete with respect to whole plot treatments and whole plots are incomplete with respect to subplot treatments, (ii) when blocks are incomplete with respect to whole plot treatments and whole plots are complete with respect to subplot treatments, and (iii) when blocks are incomplete with respect to whole plot treatments, and whole plots are incomplete with respect to subplot treatments. There is also facility to analyse data from experiments conducted using each of the above three types of incomplete split plot designs. Developed a module for online generation of Generalized Row-Column Designs (WebGRC). Computer modules for generating four series of structurally incomplete GRC designs along with randomized layout have been developed. Sample selection module is fully functional which allowed states to draw sample for complete enumeration and detailed survey for all three seasons (summer, rainy and winter) in a year according to the ISS methodology for estimation of production and number of all four livestock commodities (milk, meat, egg, wool). R-packages developed: Following R-packages were developed (i) OGS: Outlier in Genomics Data, GitHub repository (https://github.com/BudhlakotiN/OGS); (ii) EDI: Calculation of Effective Drought Index (EDI), GitHub repository (URL: https://github.com/rrk4910/ EDI); (iii) IGST: Informative Gene Selection Tool (https:/ /CRAN.R-project.org/package=IGST); (iv) PredCRG: for prediction of circadian proteins encoded by circadian genes (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ PredCRG/index.html); (v) BayesARIMA: to estimate the ARIMAX model using Bayesian framework (https:// CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesARIMAX); (vi) varEst: to estimate error variance of fitted genomic selection models from ultrahigh dimensional genomic datasets (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=varEst); (vii) GSelection: contains seven functions to select important genetic markers and predict phenotype on the basis of fitted training data using integrated model framework (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package =GSelection); (viii) STGS: genomic selection using single trait using whole genome markers information to predict genetic merit of individuals in a practical breeding programme (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package =STGS); (ix) MTGS: genomic selection using multiple traits for genomic predictions by estimating marker effects (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MTGS). For dissemination, e-learning and e-advisory in designed experiments, strengthened the Design Resources Server (https://drs.icar.gov.
