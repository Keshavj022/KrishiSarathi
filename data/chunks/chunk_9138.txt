13 tonnes/ha in 1947, With the combined efforts of the Indian Central Jute Committee until 1966 and the ICAR subsequently, the area, production and productivity of the jute and mesta have increased across the country. The area under the jute crop has now stabilized at 0.8 million hectares and that for mesta at 0.35 million hectares. India produces about 7.3 million bales of the jute fibre and 2.0 million bales of the mesta fibre. However, there has been an increase in productivity from 1.1 tonnes/ha to 1.9 tonnes/ha in jute and from 0.8 to 1.1 tonnes/ha in mesta. Tossa jute yields have been raised up to 2.5 tonnes/ ha under ideal conditions. The Indian Central Jute Committee set up in 1936 has been re-established as Jute Agricultural Research Institute near Barrackpore, West Bengal, in 1953. The Jute Technological Research Laboratory is located in Calcutta, while the coordinated research centres are operating in most jute-growing states since 1967. Together they provide a strong infrastructure for research on the fibre crops. Replacement of varieties and management techniques have been progressively contributing to improvement in yield of both jute and mesta. Poor-yielding traditional varieties like CHINSURAH GREEN (olitorius) and D 154 (capsularis), cultivated widely in the fifties, have been replaced with the high-yielding JRO 632 (olitorius) for mid-April sowing, JRC 212 (capsularis) for mid-March sowing in the mid- and -high lands and JRC 321 for the lowlands. Between 1961 and 1970, JRO 878 replaced JRO 632 and new high-yielding mesta varieties HC 583 (cannabinus) and HS 4288 (sabdariffa) came into Cultivation. For improving extraction of the sisal and ramie fibres, a decorticator has been developed. Several advances in the fibre crops have been achieved during 1971-80 — the non-premature flowering olitorius JRO 7835 and JRO 524, capsularis JRC 7447 (responsive to high+ertilizer doses) and JRC 4444 for Orissa, and a nor-bristle mesta HS 7910. The germplasm pool for both crops has been built up with 765 Collections of jute and 121 collections of mesta. The Central Nucleus Jute Seed Multiplication Farm, Bud Bud, Burdwan, is supplying the breeders’ seed regularly. Ideal cropping systems — jute-paddy—wheat for alluvial tracts and jute—paddy- potato for sandy loam soils — have also come into practice. UNDER-UTILIZED CROPS Germplasm collection of Amaranth The boost in yield of ramie varieties R 1411, R 1412, R 1449 and R 1452 has been largely through agronomic practices. Besides, a ribbon-type decorticator has been developed for jute, mesta and sunnhemp. The subsequent advance in yield has come with the release of JRO 3690 (capsularis), HYBRID C (sisal hybrid), and ramie R 67-34. The germplasm collection has been augmented to 3,000 in jute and 506 in mesta. For paper pulp, MT 150, a mesta variety has been developed.
