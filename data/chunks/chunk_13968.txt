 Thus, for GIs to be effective, less developed regions may have to invest in complementary institutions that improve judicial efﬁciency and transport infrastruc- ture. State governments must not only make efforts to obtain GIs, but consistently work towards updating and building transport infrastructure, while improving judicial efﬁciency to maximise its beneﬁts. Importantly, the govern- ment ownership of GIs does lend a helping hand to agricul- tural exports as compared to private ownership. However, it could also lead to broader distributional beneﬁts, as a signif- icant number of farmers could take advantage of the GI, unlike a scenario with a private player, where the beneﬁts may be concentrated among a select few. We also observe a shift in cropping pattern in favour of crops with the GI tag as a potential explanation for the increased production of GI products. The results at large, do add to the ongoing discus- sion over the impact of GIs, indicating that the effect of market expansion is indeed more pronounced compared to the market power effect in the context of GIs. A fruitful area for future research could be to document the effect of GIs on the welfare of both farmers and traders of GI products, with speciﬁc focus on understanding the distributional effects of gains from GIs across these groups.

GI is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the state product has a GI certiﬁcate that year. GI Filing Year is an indicator variable equal to 1 for all years between ﬁling the application for a GI and the year of grant of the GI. State-Product Event Trend is an event time variable equal to the difference between the year when GI is granted and the current year. Robust standard errors clustered at the state product level in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote statistical signiﬁcance at 1%, 5%, and 10%, respectively.

Impact of geographical indications on agricultural exports 363 Moreover, GIs could also impact technology adoption and alter the supply chain of agricultural products. As more rele- vant data becomes available, understanding the impact of GI registration on agricultural supply chains and technology adoption in farming the products would enable a better understanding of the exact mechanisms that drive the link between GIs and local economic development.
