 Growing of crop without K may be a dream which volatilizes on awakening. The crop response to both soil amendments is consistent throughout experimentation with little variation in absolute values. In all the three Alfisols, the response of kharif crop was relatively less compared to subsequent rabi crop. Table 10.

Therefore, integrated nutrient management coupled with soil amendments (FYM/lime) is the only option to sustain the productivity in Alfisols. Table 11 Average Agronomic Efficiency (kg grain/kg nutrients) of N, P, and K in soybean and wheat at Ranchi www.icar.org.in 51 2002‐2007 Treatment N (N‐C) P (NP‐N) K (NPK‐NP) Soybean N ‐12.85 ‐ ‐ NP 9.76 21.73 ‐ NPK 35.18 46.16 19.26 NPK+FYM 48.60 59.08 29.43 Wheat N ‐4.01 ‐ ‐ NP 22.24 80.76 ‐ NPK 26.77 94.71 10.99 NPK+FYM 33.76 116.21 27.93 The negative agronomic efficiency (AE) of N in both soybean and wheat indicates that N had adverse effect on plant growth. Whereas positive AE of P and K suggests that application P and K even alone also resulted in increase in yield of the crops (Fig.11). The data further revealed that inclusion of other nutrients increase the AE efficiency of nutrients. For instances, in soybean AE of P recorded in NP treatment is 21.7 kg grain/kg P which increased to 46.1 and 59.0 kg seed of soybean on application K and FYM, respectively. While in wheat AE of P recorded in NP treatment is 80.7 kg grain/kg P which increased to 94.7 and 116.2 kg seed on application of K and FYM, respectively. Thus, the results suggest that to harness the potential yield of crop in Alfisols application of nutrients in right proportion along with organic manure is essential. 0 50 100 150 200 250 AE (kg grain/kg nutrient) Finger millet Hybrid Maize BANGALORE N P K www.icar.org.in 52 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Natural Resource Management Fig.
