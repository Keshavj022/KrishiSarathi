Seed from short crop of 6-7 months age ensures good germination and improve cane yield by 2-3 tonnes/acre. Seed sett treatment: Dip the setts in carbendazim (0.5 g/l) and chlorpyriphos 20 EC (2 ml/l) or dimethoate (2ml/l) or imidacloprid 48% FS @ 1 ml/l for 15 minutes to eliminate pineapple disease and scale insect. Spacing: 80 cm between rows for early varieties and 90 cm for mid-late varieties. Adopt paired row planting (60cm x 120 cm) to promote mechanization and drip irrigation. Time of planting: Early varieties: December â€“ January Mid varieties: February Late varieties: March Fertilizer management: Plant crop: 100 kg P2O5 and 120 kg K2O/ha as basal and 168 kg N/ha in two equal split doses at 45th and 90th day after planting by pocketing. Ratoon crop: 100 kg P2O5 and 168 kg K2O and 280 kg N/ ha. Entire dose of P2 O5 and K2O with 140 kg N at the time of ratooning and the remaining 140 kg N at 45 days after ratooning. Zinc sulphate (2g / l) and ferrous sulphate (10-20 g/l) as foliar spray at 45- 60 days after planting where zinc and iron deficiencies are observed. Weed management: Spray Atrazine @ 2 kg/acre or metribuzine @ 600 g/acre in 450 l of water on the third or fourth day after planting, depending on soil moisture. Spray 2,4-D (1.8 kg) + Gramoxone (1.0 l) in 450 l/ac at 20 & 60 DAP between cane rows with hood to protect the crop or spray metribuzine @ 400 g + 2,4-D Sodium salt @ 800 g /acre at 25-30 DAP as blanket application. For the control of creeper weeds spray metsulfuran methyl + chlorimuron ethyl (Almix) @ 8.0 g/acre at 75 days after planting. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 359 Early shoot borer management: Application of carbofuran 3 G @ 13.0 kg/acre or Fipronil 0.3 G @ 10 kg/acre or chlorantriniliprole @ 9kg/acre at the time of planting. Trash mulching @ 1.25 t/ acre at 3 days after planting in plant crop and immediately after stubble shaving in ratoon crop. Spray chlorpyriphos (2.5 ml/l) or monocrotophos (1.6 ml/l) or acephate (1g/l) at 4, 6 and 9 weeks after planting with 450, 675 and 900 liters of spray fluid respectively.
