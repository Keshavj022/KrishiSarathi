 In an efficient system, each 1 kg of grain produced will require a minimum of 2,000 liters or 2 m³ of water. Good water control increases crop yields and grain quality as well as improving the efficiency of other inputs such as fertilizer, herbicide, and pesticides. To maximize water-use efficiency 1. Maintain the bunds; 2. Level the fields; 3. Puddle the fields where possible; 4. Use direct-seeding techniques; 5. Use short-duration crops; and 6. Harvest on time.
