 Wind erosion affected area extracted from desertification map of Jaisalmer for the year 2018 at 1:50k scale, spatial distribution map of diggi structures (digitized from Sentenel-2 A satellite images with 10 m spatial resolution and Google earth images) and extent of irrigated croplands (extracted generating a NDVI from Landsat 5(TM) satellite images for 2001, 2011 and 2021 year). It was found that number of diggies increased 10 times during 2021 compared to the year 2001. The irrigated area expanded about 4.5 times between the year 2000 and 2021 . The wind erosion affected area was reduced by 163371 ha. As per agricultural statistics database of Jaisalmer district for the year 2019-20, 56.0% area is irrigated through tube wells, 43.0% is canal irrigated and 1% area is irrigated through open wells. Considering the extent of culturable wastelands which occurs in 55.0% area, there is scope for more transformation of this region in agriculture and also in combating wind erosion activities using diggi based irrigation system. Temporal changes in irrigated crop area, diggi number and wind erosion affected areas Year Irrigated crop area No. of Diggi structures Year Wind erosion affected area 2001 13798 ha 395 2003 863696 ha 2011 19631 ha 509 2010 762116 ha 2021 80514 ha 4478 2020 700325 ha in rise in groundwater table in the village by 1.84 m and farmers were able to give full irrigation to rabi crops. The crop productivity has increased by 0.8 t/ha in the Bhadroli Khurd-Karada watershed, Taula-Kalol, district, Panchmahal and increased the farmers’ income by ₹16,000/ha. Benefit to Cost ratio varied from 1.65 to 2.89 with payback period of 2-3 years. The runoff filters had also increased the additional command area of nearby open wells to 12 ha in the village. IRS-LISS IV satellite images shows the Duny landscape, diggi structures and canal in Ramgarh-Dhanana area of Jaisalmer district Modified sand-based runoff filters for artificial groundwater recharge Sulphur based formulations-New reclamation agents for sodic soils: To address the availability of quality gypsum for reclaiming sodic soils, three categories of sulphur-based formulation (RFS) were developed suitable for different soil sodicity conditions. Elemental sulphur (S) based formulation increased wheat and berseem grain yield by 20-25% and 71- 111%, respectively in sodic soils. The elemental S based formulation evaluated at 83 locations in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan showed 8% (very low sodicity)–225% (high sodicity) increase in yield of wheat, rice, cotton and berseem (fodder crop). These formulations are highly reactive and get oxidized within one crop season by the soil microorganisms to help in alleviating the stress caused due to excess of the alkaline salts present in soils and also provide conducive environment for root proliferation.
