5 lakh is observed from a female size of 35-80 g and in optimum condition, a hatching rate of 85-90% is obtained. Nauplii are free swimming and non-feeding and pass through six moults (N1 to N6) and stocked separately in larval rearing tanks @ 1 lakh larvae/ tonnes.  The larvae further pass through 3 stages of protozoea, 3 stages of mysis, and then to post- larvae, which are reared in different larval rearing sections using microalgae like diatoms (Chaeoceros, Thalassiosira @ 40-130 thousand cells/ml) during protozoea and mysis stages.  Live Artemia nauplii (4-5 nos/PL) and microencapsulated particulate diet is given during PL1- PL20 stages. During PL 15-20 stages it becomes ready for stocking in ponds. Overall survival levels of 70-80% are obtained till PL 5 stage in commercial hatcheries.  The seed production technology is adopted only to a limited scale in certain hatcheries of coastal states.

Gravid females are usually collected from the wild for seed production. Maturation can be induced in adult female by unilateral eyestalk ablation.  Spawning takes place in the late night and the fertilised egg hatches out within 8-12 h after spawning depending upon the temperature with hatching rate 80 to 90%.  The nauplii are free swimming and non-feeding larvae which are stocked in the larval rearing tank (LRT) @ 50,000 to 100,000/tonnes water metamorphoses to protozoea through six moults.  The larvae pass through 3 stages of protozoea, 3 stages of mysis and then to post-larvae, which are reared in different larval rearing sections, provided with primarily with microalgae like diatoms @ 80,000-1,30,000 cell/ml during protozoea and mysis stages.  During the commercial production cycle, an antibiotics-free protocol is to be followed with probiotics/bioremediation as part of the management tool.  Live Artemia nauplii (4-5 nos/PL) and microencapsulated particulate diet is given during PL1 to PL12 stages. PL 5 larvae are transferred to PL nursery tanks and PL 15 stages onward the post-larvae become ready for stocking in ponds.  A larval survival of 40-50% is achievable from Nauplius to PL 5 stage, following which up to PL 15, a survival of 75-85% can be achieved.  The seed production technology is yet to be adopted at commercial level.
