2 kg prawns/125 days and 2,380 kg carps/350 days with 67.9 and 88.5% survival respectively. In fish-crop farming system, growth of prawns was recorded as 97.6 mg and 0.52 mg/day in a stocking density of 50,000 no./ha, showing a productivity of 627.5 kg/ha in 212 days with survival of 60.6% in a water area of 0.04 ha. Putative transgenic rohu developed through sperm electroporation technique were reared to matured stages. One set of putative rohu was successfully induced bred and 5,000 seeds were produced. The fingerlings reared in the nursery pond showed satisfactory uniform growth, average length 124 mm and weight 24.3 g, which is higher than of catla, rohu F1 hybrid backcrossed F2 (with rohu). In fish-crop-farming system, 627 kg prawn/ha was obtained in 210 days, with prawn attaining 20.7 g showing 61% survival. Rice (C 14-8) grown in rice field with zero management and without insecticides and pesticides, yielded 1 tonne/ha. The embankments of the fish-crop farming plot used for growing banana, papaya, bottle gourd and bitter gourd gave 30 kg bottle gourd and 21 kg bitter gourd. Survey carried out in different locations on marine ornamental fishes revealed that 15 species of Amphiprion were harbouring in Andaman Islands. Amphiprion species are always found in association with sea anemone. Survey recorded around 10 species of sea anemone in these Islands which were having symbiotic relationships with the anemone fishes. Breeding potential of tiger prawn, Penaeus mondon, collected from Middle Andaman coastal waters and reproductive behaviour of two edible oysters (Crassostrea rivularis and Saccostrea cucullata) were studied. ● An inter-species hybrid (Quicken) developed between Nicobari fowl and Japanese quail ● 31 species of grouper (important seafood species) recorded ● Polyculture of Marcobrachium rosenbergii with Labeo rohita and Catla catla, in 0.08 ha pond, prouduced 546.2 kg prawns/125 days and 2,380 kg carps/350 days, with 67.9 and 88.5% survival A unique inter-species hybrid Quicken was developed between Nicobari fowl and Japanese quail Grouper is an important seafood species in Andaman and is one of the most desired variety for export-oriented cage culture DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 186 Social Science and Extension Two in-service training programmes, one on improved pulse and oilseed production technology and another on health management of bovines were organized to the benefit extension personnel. Frontline demonstrations, 7 on rice, 35 on pulses, 27 on oilseeds, 5 on quail farming and 10 on Nicobari fowl, were conducted and significant results were obtained. Strain Hubbard gave an average income of Rs 12/bird, followed by Arambagh (Rs 11) and rainbow coloured broiler (Rs 8) in field. Technology assessment and refinement through institution-village linkage programme (TAR-IVLP): Significant achievements were made thorugh 12 technologies encompassing 141 farm families.
