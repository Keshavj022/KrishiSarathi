Soil & Tillage Research 228 (2023) 105644 8 Schouwenburg and Schuffelen, 1963; Sparks and Liebhardt, 1981). Cases, where ARe 0K falls between 0.01 and 0.001, indicates that apart from wedge and edge sites, planar K also took part in exchange reactions with Ca++ and Mg++. Higher exchangeable K levels usually results in higherARe 0K (Bahmani et al., 2013; Das et al., 2019; Samadi, 2012; Sparks and Liebhardt, 1981). Higher values in full CA based scenarios suggest that in these scenarios the K held in planar positions were higher than that of Sc1 and so availability of K will be more for plant uptake. Lower values in Sc1 suggests towards K being fixed in the specific sites which may be slowly available. Han et al. (2021) also reported lowest equilibrium activity ratio in soil subjected to no residue return whereas higher values were reported in treatments with residue return from all previous crops. Zhang et al. (2021) also worked out Q/I relationship in alluvial soil after 14 years with/without straw K or with/without fer­ tilizer K. They observed soil without straw or K fertilizer had lower quantity (non-specifically and specifically held K) and intensity (equi­ librium activity ratio) of K and that straw return at 6000 kg hm−2 per season along with fertilization improved the soil K supply and balance. Similarly, Zhu et al. (2020) reported the positive impact of K fertilization and straw return on soil K supplying capacity due to increase in planar K, non-specific available K and equilibrium K. Release of water soluble K from decomposition of crop residues in partial CA and full CA scenarios may be the reason for higher CRe 0K values compared to no residue addition in Sc1. Evangelou and Blevins (1988) listed out that relatively high equilibrium activity ratio may be attributed to K fertilization and return of straw or soils with higher initial levels of exchangeable K. In this case as K fertilization through chemical fertilizer is absent/ mini­ mum and the initial level of K is also not high, therefore long term residue retention/ incorporation may be the probable reason for high equilibrium activity/concentration ratio. Another interesting point is that the percentage increase in CRe 0K values from Sc1 to other scenarios was consistent with corresponding change in Planar K. This finding is further supported by positive and significant correlation of CRe 0Kand K0. Also, positive and significant correlation among available K, CRe 0Kand K0 shows that determination of available K by 1 N NH4OAC method may give an estimate of CRe 0K and K0 levels in soils. Similar relationship was also observed by Sharma et al. (2012) between ARe 0Kand NH4OAc extractable K+. However, not all Q/I parameters can be estimated using the routine method.
