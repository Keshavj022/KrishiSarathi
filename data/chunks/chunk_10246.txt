PGG-1, PGG-9, Bundel Guinea 2,4, Co-3 in Guinea grass., Marvel-8, Indian Agriculture after Independence 106 Marvel-09-4, JHD 2013-2 in Dichanthium annulatum. An interspecific hybrid between bajra and napier grass became the most popular fodder crop, now cultivated throughout India as it combined high quality and faster growth of bajra with the deep root system and multi-cut habit of napier grass. Concerted research work led to the release of several popular varieties. TNAU bred varieties such as CO-4, CO-5, CO-6, PAU bred NB-21, PBN 342, BAIF bred BNH 10,11,14, MPKV bred RBN 9, RBN 13 became extremely popular throughout the country. Table 10.
