 Again, yp signifies per capita household food expenditure, f represents the coefficients and ej is the error term. However, g which denotes the explanatory variables as explained in Table 1. 3. Results and discussion Table 2 has two main columns, namely, Ghana and India, showing descriptive statistics of variables. The average participation intensity was 0.12 and 0.11 in Ghana and India, respectively. Regarding food-security scores, Ghana had an average of 4.05 for each household, whereas India had 7.91 scores. On per capita food expenditure, it was 20.48 dollars per household for Ghana and 11.54 dollars per household for India. The implication is that, household per capita food expenditure is higher in Ghana than in India in the dataset, which could largely be attributed to the cost of living in the study area. Averagely, the ages were approximately 44 years in Ghana and 46 years in India. The result is indicative that, UA, in general, is less known among the youth; hence, the youth could be encouraged to venture into UA to support the family and generate income. The mean values for formal education indicate a level of formal education attainment among UA farmers. The mean acreage for the Ghana India Variables Mean Std. Dev Min Max Mean Std.

Summary statistics of variables Extent of urban agriculture and food security 445 land size in acres allocated for UA among households were approximately 2 and 1 in Ghana and India, respectively. On household size, it was approximately six (6) in Ghana and seven (7) in India. Averagely, households had 13 years and 11 years’ worth of experience in UA in Ghana and India, respectively. Food expenditure was US$ 109 in Ghana compared to US$ 73 in India. In urban areas, food is usually sold at higher prices. Again, the average household expenditure was approximately US$ 294 and US$121 in Ghana and India, respectively.
