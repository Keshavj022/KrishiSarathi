African Swine Fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease of pigs. In its acute form the disease generally results in high mortality. ASF is a different disease to swine flu. The virus does not affect people and there is no impact on human health.   ASF is highly contagious disease of pigs - both domestic and wild. The mortality range may be as high as 100%. While there is no report of its being zoonotic, yet in the absence of an effective vaccine against the African swine fever virus, prevention in countries free of the disease depends on stringent import policies, ensuring that neither infected live pigs nor pork products are introduced into areas free of ASF. This includes ensuring proper disposal of food from waste aircraft, ships or vehicles coming from infected states and enhancing bio security measures; particularly in backyard or non-commercial pig farms.
