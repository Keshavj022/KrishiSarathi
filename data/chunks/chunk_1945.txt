 • Livestock Management: Livestock management involves critical disease detection, vaccination, production management, tracking, and health monitoring. Based on a comprehensive review conducted by (Hossain et al., 2022), the most used ML models for cattle identification were support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and artificial neural network (ANN). Based on evaluation metrics, SVM, KNN, ANN, and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) shows highest accuracy of more than 99% in cattle identification. The cattle identification with more than 99% accuracy was also achieved using DL models like ResNet, Inception, DenseNet, and the neural architecture search network (NasNet). 3.3. Big Data Analytics Big data analytics is the use of advanced analytical techniques against very large and diverse datasets containing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data of varying sizes from terabytes to zettabytes from different sources. With the analysis of big data, analysts, researchers, and business users are enabled to make better and faster decisions by using previously unused data. For this purpose, advanced analytical techniques such as text analytics, machine learning, predictive analytics, data mining, statistics, and natural language processing can be used. Big data has prominent applications in agriculture. For this reason, it is also called big data-driven farming. Big data supports better quality and more informed decisions.

To achieve precise and smart management of irrigation practices in fields, (Sayari et al., 2021) recommend the use of machine learning models such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and federated learning models. e Livestock Management: Livestock management involves critical disease detection, vaccination, production management, tracking, and health monitoring.
