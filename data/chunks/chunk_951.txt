6% head rice recovery with desirable intermediate alkali spreading value (ASV) and amylose content (AC) (24.33%). It has soft gel consistency (GC) with very occasionally chalky and long slender grains showing good cooking quality. It is resilient to changes in rainfall distribution. Beside drought (reproductive stage) tolerant, this variety can also tolerate 10–12 days submergence at vegetative stage. This variety possesses semi-erect flag leaf, long slender grain, long and well exerted compact panicle, high tillering (10–12 tillers/hill), with test weight of 25.6 g. Frequent occurrence of drought and submergence are the major challenge to sustain the rice production in the eastern states of India. The rice crop grown in these states invariably suffer due to water stress (drought or submergence) at the different development stages. Therefore, beside irrigated ecology, rice variety Swarna Samriddhi Dhan also recommended for drought prone as well as flood prone areas of Bihar to ensure the food security in these targeted areas. Target areas for cultivation Rice variety Swarna Samriddhi Dhan is primarily targeted for cultivation under transplanted condition in irrigated and rainfed shallow lowland ecology of the state of Bihar. It can also be cultivated in water limiting irrigated areas where rainfall is inadequate to sustain rice production and drought and flood prone rainfed areas of Bihar as well as other states of eastern region. Yield potential and agronomic adaptation Rice genotype RCPR 10 (Swarna Samriddhi Dhan) was entered as IET 24306 under irrigated medium duration trial in AICRIP coordinated programme during wet season of 2014. During three years (2014–2016) of national AICRIP testing, this variety showed stable yield in Zone III and found promising for Bihar. Based on three years of testing in Zone III IET 24306 has recorded an overall mean grain yield 5.73 t/ha and showed yield advantage of 17.4, 6.9 and 10% over national (NDR 359), zonal and local checks, respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, based on three-year testing (2014– 2016) in Bihar under AICRIP programme, IET 24306 (Swarna Samriddhi Dhan) has recorded mean grain yield of 6.24 t/ha and showed yield gain of 33.7, 12.7 and 35.2% over national, zonal and local checks respectively (Table 2). Based on four years testing (on- station trial at ICAR-RCER, Patna) under irrigated condition, IET 24306 has recorded an overall mean grain yield 6.98 t/ha and showed yield gain of 16.2% over check variety Rajendra Sweta. Whereas under the drought (reproductive stage) condition, IET 24306 has recorded an overall mean grain yield 3.40 t/ha and performed at par with Sahbhagi Dhan and showed yield gain of 36.2% over check variety Rajendra Sweta. Based on three-year testing (on-station) under submergence (15–18 days) condition, IET 24306 recorded overall mean grain yield of 1.31 t/ha. Whereas, in 8–10-day submergence IET 24306 recorded overall mean grain yield of 3.12 t/ha.
