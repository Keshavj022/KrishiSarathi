 Some scholars have assessed agricultural efficiency, which refers to the ability of the agricultural land to attain the highest level of output given a set of inputs (Chennareddy, 1967; Arnade, 1998; Pender and Fafchamps, 2006; Tchale, 2009; Toma et al., 2015; Pang et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021). Moreover, Zhou and Li (2017) explored land use efficiency, and Li et al. (2021) investigated agro-ecological efficiency. Nevertheless, S. DAS, et al.: Spatio-temporal variation and relationship between agricultural... Regional Sustainability (2024) 5(2) 100144 3 there is a considerable scarcity of studies that focus explicitly on agricultural efficiency. In Karnataka, a semi-arid state, irrigation intensity emerges as a pivotal factor in enhancing agricultural efficiency, given the inadequacy and high variability of precipitation. This study aims to address the following two primary concerns: (i) to examine the spatio-temporal variation of agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity in Karnataka from 2004–2005 to 2018–2019; and (ii) the relationship between agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity and scrutinize their impacts on agricultural efficiency from 2004–2005 to 2018–2019. Conducting a comprehensive study on agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity at the state level is essential for informed policy formulation and the design of location-specific and integrated agricultural development plans. 2. Theoretical background The role of agricultural efficiency is critical in promoting agricultural productivity and effectively allocating economy resources. In predominantly agricultural countries such as India, the challenge of limited agricultural land and the mounting pressure of growing population, present a significant and escalating threat over time. Consequently, the urgency to improve agricultural efficiency becomes paramount to meet the increasing needs of the expanding population (Halder, 2019). Bhatia (1967a) asserted that agricultural efficiency is an amalgamation of three interconnected factors: physical, socio-economic, and technical-organizational factors, which collectively shape the agricultural landscape of a region. The relationship between agricultural productivity and agricultural efficiency is intricate and dichotomous (Dutta, 2012). Laha and Puri (2011) emphasized the pivotal role of agricultural efficiency in advancing Indian farming practices and identified key determinants in rural areas. As previously highlighted, diverse metrics, including output per unit area, output per worker, input-output ratio, and the value of agricultural output, are employed to assess agricultural efficiency (Shafi, 1960; Sapre and Deshpande, 1964; Bhatia, 1967a, b). Kendall (1953) pioneered the concept of output per unit area by utilizing a ranking coefficient based on acre yield and average rank.
