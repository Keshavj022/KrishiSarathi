 The entire amount of C, approximately 80 to 90% of N, 25% of P, 20% of K and 50% of S present in the crop residues are lost in the form of various gaseous and particulate matters resulting in atmospheric pollution. It is also estimated that about 70% CO2, 7% CO, 0.66% CH4 and 2.1% N emitted as N2O from crop residue burning, which impacts on environment heavily. It is estimated that one tonne rice residue on burning releases 13 kg particulate matter, 60 kg CO, 1460 kg CO2, 3.5 kg NOx, 0.2 kg SO2. Burning of 23 million tonnes of rice residues in North-West India leads to a loss of about 9.2 million tonnes of C equivalent (CO2-equivalent of about 34 million tonnes) per year and a loss of about 1.4×105 t of N (equivalent to ` 200 crores) annually. In addition to these losses the straw burning also causes deterioration of soil physical health, health hazards and accidents, air pollution and emission of greenhouses gases and loss of micro-biodiversity. Crop Residue Management Options In-situ management of straw or removing the straw from the field for other uses are the two alternate and safe methods for straw management. 1. In-situ Crop Residue Management There are two major options under this method: Introduction 5 Introduction A. Retaining, incorporating or mulching the crop residues in the field In order to curb burning and reducing winter smog pollution, a Central Sector Scheme on “Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-situ Management of Crop Residue in States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi” has been approved by the Government of India and it is being operated through DoAC&FW. Budget allocated to the scheme was ` 1151.80 crore for two years (for 2018-19: ` 591.65 crore, and for 2019-2020; ` 560.15 crore) and it is further extended for one more year (2020-21) with a budgetary allocation of ` 600 crores. Under this scheme, there is financial assistance on purchase of following straw management implements: • Super Straw Management System (Super SMS) to be attached with Combine Harvester • Happy Seeder • Paddy Straw Chopper/ Shredder/Mulcher • Shrub Master/ Rotary Slasher • Hydraulic Reversible M.B. Plough • Zero Till Seed cum Fertilizer Drill • Super seeder • Bailing machine • Crop reaper. The paddy residue burning events were monitored by multiple satellites with thermal sensors during the paddy harvest period from 01 October to 30 November in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. There is considerable reduction in the burning events of the crop residue. Overall, the total burning events recorded during 2019 in the three states (Punjab, Haryana and UP) were 18.8% less as compared during 2018, 31% as compared to 2017, and 51.9% as compared to 2016. However, our target is zero crop residues burning in the states. To achieve this, it has been suggested that the ex-situ management options may also be used for straw management. During the project period, 1.
