   Application of Gypsum @ 500 kg/ha at pegging stage near podding zone for pod development .   Weed management with Pendimethalin 30 EC @ 3.3 l/ha as pre-emergence herbicide followed by post-emergence application of Imazethapyr @ 750 ml/ha at 20 to 25 days after sowing. Cotton   Sow the crop early by June 1st/2nd week after receipt of sufficient good rains atleast (60mm). Don’t sow cotton crop after July 20th as yields will be reduced drastically under rainfed conditions.   Sowing of Cotton on raised bed under rainfed conditions facilitates the crop to withstand heavy rains and moisture stress conditions. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 154   In a village or area all the cotton cultivating farmers should take up the sowings on community basis and complete within a period of 7 – 10 days.   Depending on soil conditions cotton should be sown at a spacing of 120 x 60 cm/ 120 x 45 cm/ 90 x 60 cm/ 90 x 45 cm / 90 x 30 cm   Deep summer plough to destroy the eggs of insect pests and to remove weed stock   Intercrop with greengram/blackgram/soybean/cluster bean in 1:2 or 1:3 ratio, and red gram 4:1 / 6:1 / 8:1 ratio which also helps to manage sucking pests   Grow 2-3 rows of maize or sorghum as border crop as barrier to prevent pests   Treat the seed with imidacloprid 70 WS@ 5 g per kg or thiamethoxam 70% WS @ 4 g per kg followed by Trichoderma viridi or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g per kg   Pre-emergence herbicides like pendimethalin (Stamp extra) @ 700 ml/acre should be applied within 24 -48 hours after sowing with the help of hand sprayer for better control of weeds in cotton.   Application of post emergence herbicides like quizalofop ethyl @ 400 ml + pyrithiobac sodium @ 250 ml in 200 liters of water at 30 DAS in cotton to control grasses and broad leaved weeds.   Inspect the crop at squaring and flowering stage for presence of PBW larvae within flowers. Installation of Pheromone traps @10/acre and monitoring ETL at this stage is 10 % damaged flowers.   Spray MgSO4 @ 10 g/l twice at 45 and 75 DAS; Boron @ 1.5 g/l twice at 60 and 90 DAS; 0.5% FeSO4 with citric acid twice at weekly intervals and ZnSO4 @ 2 g/l twice at 4-5 days interval at 45 DAS to manage micronutrient deficiencies.   During excess rainfall, drain excess water and apply 25:20 kg urea and potash per acre   Spray Planofix (NAA 10 PPM) @ 1 ml per 4.5 liters of water twice at 10-15 days interval to manage flower dropping   Spray 1% KNO3 or 19:19:19, 20:20:20, 21:21:21   Follow rotation of insecticide sprays against insect pests for high efficiency.   Stem application of fipronil 1: 4 at 30 DAS and Flonicamid / Imidacloprid with water (1:20) at 45, 60 DAS to be done which protects the crop from early season sucking pests like jassids and aphids.
