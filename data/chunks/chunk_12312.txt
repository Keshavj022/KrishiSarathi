 Livelihood Zone cashew nut, coconut, chillies diversification and stability of income Paddy cum fish culture The low lying unproductive land can be converted to productive units through proper land shaping and integration of paddy with fish culture. Pond dykes can be utilized for growing horticulture crops like banana, papaya, vegetable crops and the retained water in reserve pond and trenches can be utilized for life saving irrigation to rabi crops after harvesting of fish. The intervention IFS paddy cum fish (0.7 ac paddy, 0.3 ac fish culture) gave yield (Paddy :11.34 q, Fish :4.20 q) With net returns of Rs. 28760/ha, whereas sole paddy crop in flood prone area gave yield of 13.77 q with net returns of Rs.10480/ha. Productivity enhancement and cost reduction Zero tillage Maize cultivation in rice fallow situations â€“ A Cost reduction and resource conservation technology Maize is the second major crop after paddy in the district. As per the field condition 3 - 4 irrigations are required, two irrigations will be saved compared to normal method of maize cultivation. The yield obtained was about 7 per cent higher than conventionally cultivated maize. After the successful demonstration of technology in farmers field, 1850 farmers and presently around 2500 acres of area is under zero tillage maize. North Coastal Zone: District: Vizianagarm (paddy, banana, cashew nut, mango, oil palm and chillies, bajra, ragi, jowar and cash crops sugarcane, groundnut, sesame, niger) Productivity enhancement Reviving cultivation of rice fallow pluses with the introduction of disease tolerant varieties Demonstration of YMV tolerant cultivar LBG-752 in participatory cluster frontline demonstrations by KVK Vizianagaram indicated a bridgeable yield gap of 6.16 q/ha and additional net returns of Rs. 46200/ha Productivity enhancement Intercropping in Sugarcane enhances profitability in Vizianagaram district of North Coastal Zone. Sugarcane + bhindi (Sugarcane equivalent yield:118.2 t/ ha; net returns of Rs.128,940/ha), sugarcane+ cluster bean (Sugarcane equivalent yield: 119.1 t/ha; net returns of Rs. 129,919/ha), sugarcane + spinach (Sugarcane equivalent yield: 105.1 t/ha; net returns of Rs. 102,420/ ha) Sugarcane sole (Sugarcane equivalent yield: 98.2 t/ha; net returns of Rs. 95,913/ha) State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 17 Area Major Intervention Objective contribution Generation of additional income Mushroom cultivation as livelihood option in tribal villages of Visakhapatnam Training on Mushroom cultivation during 2015- 2016 under Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) programme was given to 60 farmers and youth from 6 tribal mandals on chemical treatment of paddy straw, preparation of beds, spawning and casing of mushroom beds etc. On completion of training mushroom cultivation was taken up by one SHG with the technical support by the staff KVK. Each member of the group is earning additional income of Rs. 2750.
