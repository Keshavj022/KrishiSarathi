 Development of new diagnostics for FMD: A SYBR green-based FMDV-3Dpol specific one-step real-time RT- PCR (rRT-PCR) test was developed for pan-serotype identification of FMD virus. The limit of detection of FMDV RNA was 10-2 TCID50/50 µl, which is 10 times more sensitive than the traditional agarose gel electrophoresis-based RT-multiplex PCR (RT-mPCR). A perfect concordance was observed between the new rRT- PCR and traditional RT-mPCR on viral RNA in the archived FMDV cell culture isolates tested. Therefore, the SYBR green-based 3Dpol specific one step rRT-PCR could be considered as a valuable assay with higher diagnostic sensitivity to complement the routine assays being used for FMD virus diagnosis in India. A new serological assay (IgM I-ELISA) was developed to detect anti-FMD IgM antibodies specific for FMDV 2B NSP. This test can be used to detect persistently infected animals as it is not feasible to test the oro-pharyngeal fluid (OPF) samples while screening a large animal population for detection of carrier state of FMD. Percentage of positivity (PP) values from 507 archival serum samples were analyzed through receiver- operating curve (ROC), where the cut-off point was found to be 48 PP and the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity at this cut-off was found to be 97.98% and 96.67%, respectively. Molecular epidemiology: The capsid coding region (P1/VP1) sequences of 13 FMD viral strains were inferred and added to the sequencing database of Indian FMD viruses (10 serotype O and 3 serotype Asia 1). The O/ME-SA/Ind2001 lineage since its first report in the year 2001 has diversified into at least five sub-lineages (Ind2001a, b, c, d and e). The phylogenetic comparison of serotype O isolates with representative strains revealed emergence of sub-lineage O/ME-SA/Ind2001e during the year 2015 in India. The emerging lineage O/ME-SA/ Ind2001e was responsible for sporadic incidences during 2015–2017, before causing outbreaks in epidemic proportion during the year 2018. In serotype O, the exclusive dominance of the O/ME-SA/Ind2001e lineage was discovered during 2020. Emergence of exotic and emerging animal diseases SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in lions: In May 2021, 8 out of 10 lions, reported to be sick with respiratory symptoms, in the Arignar Zoological Park, Chennai, were tested positive by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). To further confirm the diagnosis and genetic characterization, whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 4 lions were generated using MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein sequences showed that the spike protein sequences contained 9 amino acid substitutions and 2 deletions compared with the Wuhan- Hu-1 strain, and are typically matched with a delta variant (B.1.167.2) of SARS-CoV-2. The study reported the first confirmed natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in Asiatic lions in India, caused by a variant of concern (VOC delta, B.1.167.2 lineage).
