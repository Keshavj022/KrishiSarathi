Anjali rice. It is a Central Release for rainfed uplands; recommended for Bihar, Assam, and Orissa. Its yield ranges from 3.5 to 4.5 tonnes/ha DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 18 Hybrid Rice Technology In advanced variety trials, EXPH 208 (E), PAC 89001 (ME), XR 593 (ME) and PRH 122 (ME) have showed a yield advantage ranging from 12 to 24% over the highest yielding check varieties. IR 68888A, DRR 2A and CRMS 31A are the new rice CMS lines possessing desirable quality traits. Two cytoplasmic male sterile lines, Pusa 3A and Pusa 5A, in WA genetic background, have been registered. With the integrated nutrient management during dry season in the hybrid rice, grain yield of PHB 71 was maximum (7.92 tonnes/ha) with 135 kg N/ha as urea + FYM at 7 tonnes/ha. Urea at 71 kg N/ha + FYM at 7 tonnes/ha + Azolla dual- cropping was at a par with urea alone at 135 kg N/ha, which suggests that 50% of the fertilizer-N for hybrid rice can be substituted by organic manure and biofertilizer Azolla. Biotechnology Through marker-aided selection, bacterial leaf blight resistance genes xa5, xa13 and xa21 are being introgressed into rice BPT 5204 and Triguna. The plants are currently at the BC4F1 stage for SS1113 × BPT 5204 and at BC3F1 for SS1113 × Triguna.
