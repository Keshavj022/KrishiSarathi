 The use of standard deviation ensures the thresholds to be sensitive to the inherent fluctuations in SM conditions across diverse geographical areas. This adaptability enhances accuracy in identifying drought events by distinguishing significant deviations from normal fluctuations. 2. Study area and data 2.1. Study area The Southern Plateau and Hills (SPH) is one of the India’s 15 Agro- Climatic Zones (ACZs) as divided by the Planning Commission of India (Fig. 1a, 10th zone). The SPH consists of the Indian states of Telangana and major portions of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. It is situated between the 73◦51′ to 82◦4′ East longitudes and the 9◦46′ and 19◦53′ North latitudes. The elevation of the SPH varies from 73 m below sea level to 2651 m above sea level (Fig. 1b). Precipitation in this zone ranges from 576 mm in the Northern regions to 1051 mm in the Southern regions. The major soil types in SPH include red, alluvium and black cotton soils, red loam and red sandy loam, and shallow to deep black clay (Annamali, 2006). The SPH is semi-arid, and 74 % of farming in the study area is dryland farming. Cropping intensity in this zone is low with only about half the area cultivated (Annamali, 2006). Under- developed irrigation in this zone has resulted in unstable and low agri- cultural yields (Annamali, 2006). 2.2. Data used The current study has three variables i.e. Soil Moisture (SM), pre- cipitation and temperature data to develop the drought indices. The following discussion provides the complete details of the data. The multi-satellite merged ESACCI SM (Gruber et al., 2019) at 0.25◦×0.25◦resolution is used in this study. The v06.1 of ESACCI SM is extracted over SPH from 1991 to 2020 to develop the SM-based drought indices. The ESACCI SM v0.61 ingests satellite SM datasets from 14 different satellite sensors, including 4 active microwave and 10 passive microwave sensors to provide daily global SM at surface depth (0 ~ 5 cm) in m3/m3 from 1978 to 2020 (downloaded from: https://climate. esa.int/en/projects/soil-moisture/). The names and the temporal evo- lution of the active and passive sensors combined to complete the v0.61 product are shown in Fig. A1 (Appendix A.1). The monthly precipitation (in m) and temperature (2 m above land in K) data for the study are obtained from the Land component of fifth generation ReAnalysis dataset of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), ERA5-Land at 0.1◦×0.1◦resolution for the time period of 1991 to 2020 to develop the drought indices (Mu˜noz-Sabater et al., 2021; https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/). Additionally ERA5-Land monthly surface SM (0 ~ 7 cm) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) monthly surface SM (0 ~ 10 cm) from 1991 to 2020 are used to validate the ESACCI SM. The GLDAS SM data for 1991 to 1999 is obtained from GLDAS v2.0 (Beaudoing et al., 2019), and for 2000 to 2020 from GLDAS v2.1 (Beaudoing et al., 2020).
