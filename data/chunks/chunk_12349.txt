Fisheries sector In fisheries sector, the major constraints across the agro-climatic zones are as follows:   Quality brood management   High cost of feed   Lack of integrated fish farming models/units   Lack of quality seed and fish fingerlings, particularly of IMC   Unorganized marketing sector   Lack of cold chain and cold storage   Inadequate number of trained extension functionaries D. Constraints of Beekeeping Industry in Bihar   Bihar is enriched with highly diversified, abundant bee-flora and favourable ecological conditions. The honey production potential is about three times (60-65 kg) higher than the national average (20 kg) and very high than any state of India, viz., Punjab (30 kg) H.P. (35 kg) and Haryana (20 kg) per hive per year.   Beekeepers are not alert to build up their colonies to full strength before honey flow season resulting in poor honey yield.   Extraction of unripe honey and honey from brood cell reduces quality of honey.   Queen excluder are not properly used which also affect quality of honey. State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 67   Old and blackish frames are used in super chamber and exchange of brood frame and super frames decline honey yield with dark colour.   At the time of extraction of honey, proper care is not taken to clean the equipments, container and filter. Extraction is not done in bee proof chamber.   Beekeepers generally place dark colour old frames in super chamber resulting the production of poor quality honey.   Processing of raw honey is not done by beekeepers to prevent fermentation and granulation.   The level of HMF (Hydoxy-Methyl-Furfuraldehyde) should be below permissible level in honey and care is not taken by beekeepers.   Uncontrolled heating of honey during processing by beekeepers causes loss of flavour, aroma, enzyme, taste and colour.   Honey is stored poorly during storage by beekeepers in metallic container which rust and darken the stored honey.   There is no agency to issue quarantine or migration certificate of bee colonies.   Delay in official formalities, particularly at check gates results in mortality of the honeybees.
