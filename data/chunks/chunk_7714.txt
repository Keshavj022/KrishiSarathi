 Patent has been filed for ‘Somatic embryo regeneration vessel’—Application Number-201841005897. Production of 500–700 plantlets per vessel in 90 days CROP MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 75 developed for differentiating P. capsici and P. tropicalis infecting black pepper. The assay is 10 times more sensitive than PCR and could detect Phytophthora from infected black pepper leaf, stem and root using both purified DNA and crude extracts. Mushrooms Wet bubble disease: Spray application of Thiophanate methyl (0.05%) was effective preventive measure with maximum control of wet bubble disease (89.54%) with highest mushroom yield (17.91%) followed by a botanical [Pongamia glabra/Pongamia pinnata (Karanj)] pesticide. Under curative action, thiophanate methyl (0.05%) registered highest mushroom yield (21.61%) with 96.04% control of wet bubble disease followed by a botanical (Opuntia sp + Oryza sativa) pesticide-Prabal @ 0.1% with 18.51% yield and 99.55% disease control. Orchids Tissue culture protocol: An efficient procedure for rapid and mass in vitro propagation of Cymbidium whiteae through in vitro culture of thin cross-sections (TCSs) derived from young protocorms on modified Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium was standardized. Protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) were directly induced from the TCS explants and developed completely into shoots within 8–10 weeks of culture. ❑ 8. Livestock Management Nutrition Carnitine chelated trace minerals: A method was developed for production of carnitine chelated trace minerals (Cu-carnitine, Zn-carnitine, Mn-carnitine and Cr-carnitine) for improving bioavailability and tissue utilization of trace minerals and tissue carnitine concentration and thereby improving production performance in ruminants. Cu, Zn, Mn and Cr in the chelated products were 13.0, 15.5, 13.5 and 10.3%, respectively. Both the Cu-carnitine and Zn-carnitine chelated products are completely soluble in abomasal and intestinal pH solution. Improving fodder quality: Experiments were conducted to evaluate effect of correction of zinc deficiency in soils on yield and quality of fodder jowar crop (variety: Co FS-31) and impact of feeding zinc- fortified fodder in improving the zinc status in sheep. The results indicated that correction of zinc deficiency in soil improved zinc content in jowar fodder by over 16 ppm. Its feeding to sheep for four months enhanced their growth rate by over 40% and mean serum zinc content by 0.24 ppm. Buffalo Water productivity: On an average 280–300 litre of water is utilized with traditional hose pipe on cleaning of floor of one bull pen daily. However, using trigger shut off on hose, 75–100 litre water was saved daily in comparison to traditional cleaning method of floor cleaning of one Frieswal bull pen.
