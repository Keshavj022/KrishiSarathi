 Adaptations in the Himalayan regions include contour and terrace farming along with snow water retention techniques for CRA adapta- tion, while converting Jhum fields to commercial agricultural fields has proven more reliable in the northeastern region (Singh et al., 2017). In the eastern Himalayas, the Apatani people use a paddy-cum-fish agro- ecosystem, while in the Western Himalayan region, the Lahaula practice a high degree of agro-biodiversity through snow-water collection and mixed cropping-livestock farming (Aich et al., 2022). In southern and central India, low-cost adaptation strategies such as altering sorghum planting dates and varieties can reduce crop sensitivity and enhance productivity (Srivastava et al., 2010). Additionally, foxtail millet cultivation has provided a resilient livelihood during significant rainfall variability and severe drought in the semi-arid Deccan Plateau (Bala, 2004). 7.2. Key elements that enhance resilience in India Indian farmers are diversifying crops like cereals, pulses, and vege- tables to reduce risks from climate change and market instability. Agroforestry, livestock, and fisheries add their income security. Water management through rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation is crucial, supported by programs like PMKSY (The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sin- chayee Yojana) (URL: https://pmksy.gov.in/). Organic farming, crop rotation, and the Soil Health Card Scheme improve soil health. Initiatives like NMSA (the National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture) endorse CRA varieties to ensure stable pro- duction (URL: https://nmsa.dac.gov.in/). Farmers are adopting agro- ecological methods such as natural farming and integrated pest management, enhancing biodiversity and reducing chemical use. Technologies like satellite weather forecasts and apps like Kisan Suvidha help farmers make informed decisions. Government schemes like NFSM (The National Food Security Mission) (URL: https://www.nfsm.gov.in/) and PMFBY (The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana) (URL: htt ps://pmfby.gov.in/) provide support, crop insurance, and credit ac- cess. SHGs and cooperatives encourage collective action and resource sharing. S. Sahoo et al. Environmental and Sustainability Indicators 25 (2025) 100544 8 Traditional practices, including mixed cropping, minimum tillage, and water conservation, help farmers address climate challenges. Pre- serving indigenous knowledge and India’s rich agrobiodiversity strengthens long-term agricultural resilience (Jiao et al., 2024). These elements and India’s growing focus on climate adaptation, sustainable farming practices, and technological progress are vital for enhancing agricultural resilience in a country where millions rely on farming for their livelihoods. In addition, the following strategies can mainly shape the best CRA achievement.
