 How many copies were adjudged to be present in the lines from which Bn-Bt was ultimately repurified? The material that was used for re purification was adjudged as multicopy Bt by Bangalore Genel Can you send me a timeline, in terms of the years in which different generations (starting from TO/Tl until T7/TS) were grown. This will give the committee, in a nutshell, the chronology of the development and repurification of BnBt. Generation wise information was Enclosed Yours sincerely Katageri Dr.!. S. Katageri, Principal Scientist (Cotton), Agriculture Research Station, Dhmwadfarm, Dharwad-580007 INDIA. Mobile: +919448822266 Office: 0836-2741092 51. Generation wise seed multiplieation in BNBt Year Gene- Population size ration 2001-02 To 79 plants in transgenic green housc. 2002-03 TI Twelve progenies were grown in 84 rows each with different numbers of rows depending on availability of seeds. Each row was 6 m length. There was no germination for one progeny. 2003-04 T2 Only eleven progenies were continued, each with 25 rows. 2004-05 T, 917 plants of AT, 8-10 based on single copy introgression of southern analysis were sown in open field under isolation. Seeds ofBt positive plants were used for RCGM trial during 2005-06. 2005-06 T. 78 plants selected as homozygous based on Bt strip test were sown each aboutl5 rows under isolation in an open field. Seeds of Bt positive plants based on Bt strip test were used for RCGM trial in 2006-07. 2006-07 Ts Progenies of 25 homozygous (Based on Bangalore Genie report) plants were raised in open field under isolation. 2007-08 T6 Progenies of25 plants were raised in open field under isolation. 2008-09 T7 Bulk seeds of homozygous plants were used in seed production at different farms ofUAS, Dharwad under isolation. 2009-10 Ts Bulk seeds were grown at ARS, Dharwad - - Dear Sir Following is the information Answer to queries. 1. The materials and methods section of the Current Science paper indicates that T3 generation of plants were grown in the 2003-04 growing season. The table that you have sent me indicates that T2 generation was grown in the 2003-04 season. Can you please clarify? If necessary, please revise your table. Sir, the generation raised in 2003-04 was T2 only. 2. You had indicated earlier that Bangalore Genei has done homozygosity test in 2006. Was this done in January 2006? What was the generation of plants that was used for PCR based homozygosity testing by Bangalore genei? If the table is being revised, please indicate the correct generation as per revised table. Homozygosity test was done in May-June, 2006 by Bangalore Genei. T4 generation plants were used for this test. 3. The Current Science paper indicates that Southern analysis was done on T4 plants. In which year and month was this analysis done? Southern analysis was done at NRCPB New Delhi. Records may be available at NRCPB New Delhi 4. The Current science paper indicates that Southern analysis in T4 generation was done on T-l-ll plants.
