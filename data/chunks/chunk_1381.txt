Participatory rural appraisal activities identified large fallow lands other than the current fallow after wheat harvest in both villages. Before the inception of the project, only 2.1% and 5.6% of the total cultivable lands were used for greengram and blackgram cultivation during the summer season in Umariya Choubey and Barauda, respectively. Farmers in these villages were dependent on traditional agriculture which resulted in low yields and loss of resources. Intervention in terms of conducting trainings, farmer-scientist interface meetings and continuous exposure of the farmers to the research farms of ICAR-DWR enhanced the knowledge of the farmers on integrated management of greengram and blackgram cultivation. Introduction of short-duration high-yielding disease-resistant varieties like Samrat and Virat of greengram and PU-31 and PU-1 of blackgram along with Rhizobium biofertilizer with broad-spectrum weed management through imazethapyr as critical input made large impact on crop diversification in fallow lands after wheat harvest. Continuous adoption of the integrated management technologies of greengram and blackgram cultivation by the farmers and logistic support provided by the Farmer FIRST Programme team of ICAR-DWR led to the dynamic revival of summer fallow lands up to 98% in Umariya Choubey and 97% in Barauda with average additional seed yield of 30 to 32% and average additional profit of 62 to 63% over farmers’ practice during last seven years under Farmer FIRST Programme. After shifting the project to the new location, the farmers of Umariya Choubey and Barauda are continuously growing greengram and blackgram during the summer season after the wheat harvest. *Corresponding author email: pkm_agronomy@yahoo.co.in Table 1.
