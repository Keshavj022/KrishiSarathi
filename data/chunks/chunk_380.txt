55 t/ha CCS yield. The straight, thick, and yellowish-green colour are the characteristic features of this variety. The variety exhibits good ratooning ability and is moderately resistant to red rot. So, CoS 13235 variety is supposed to be a good replacement of Co 238 due to its resistance to red rot and high yield than its counterpart. CoLk 14201 (Ikshu-10) Another early maturing sugarcane variety, CoLk 14201 (Ikshu-10) was developed by ICAR- IISR, Lucknow and released by CVRC in 2021 for North West Zone. This variety produces 81.99 t/ha cane yield, 10.55 t/ha CCS yield, and 18.67% sucrose at harvest. The cane diameter (2.55 cm) and cane height (217 cm) with small internodes. Resistant to smut, moderately resistant red rot and also exhibit water logging tolerance. This variety is also identified as a good replacement of Co 238 due to high- yield and resistance to red rot disease. Mid-late varieties CoLk 11206 (Ikshu-4) This variety was developed by ICAR-IISR, Lucknow in 2018 under mid-late group for North West Zone. It was developed by segregating progenies of cross Co Pant 90223 x Co 62198. The variety showed excellent performance in this zone with 91.50 t/ha cane yield, 11.20 t/ha CCS yield and 17.65% sucrose in juice. The cane is medium thick and yellow-green in colour. The top is green and the leaves are straight and circular in front. It is moderately resistant to red rot disease and also tolerant to lodging conditions. This variety is suitable for multiple ratooning with the lush green top at maturity. This provides additional benefits to the farmer in the form of green fodder during the late crushing season. Co Pant 12226 Co Pant 12226 is a mid-late maturing variety that was developed from the cross Co 1158 x Co Pant 90223 made at N.H.G., Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore and evaluated at G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar. The proposed variety recorded 127.56 t/ha cane yield, 17.44 t/ha CCS yield and 19.42% sucrose. It showed moderate resistance against red rot and smut disease. Co Pant 12226 was released by SVRC in 2021 for cultivation in Uttarakhand and recommended for irrigated conditions. This variety exhibits desirable features i.e., erect, tall, non-lodging, non-flowering and absence of pithiness and splits on internodes. Co Pant 13224 Co Pant 13224 is a mid-late maturing sugarcane variety released by SVRC in 2021 for cultivation in Uttarakhand. This clone was developed through selection from the progenies of the cross Co 1158 x Co Pant 90223. Co Pant 13224 has inherited good juice quality and yield characteristics from its parent, which are high-yielding varieties of the mid-late maturity group in North-west Zone. It exhibited 97.89 t/ha cane yield, 17.33 t/ha CCS yield and 19.90% sucrose. This variety is moderately resistant to red rot and resistant against smut disease. With good ratooning ability, it will be a good alternative for the farmers of Uttarakhand.
