 For doubling farmers’ income, work under the watershed development programme is needed to be accelerated in Tripura conditions.   Restoration of wetlands: Large wetlands/water bodies (like Rudra Sagar and Dumbur lake) in the state have been shrinking in size as a direct consequence of human interventions. If action for restoration of these water bodies is delayed further, these will soon become extinct. These water bodies, in addition to holding huge amount of water, help in maintaining a buffer zone which mitigates the natural extreme of excess/shortfall in water flow. Besides, they support a large number of aquatic lives and are good biodiversity spots. 556 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Technical issue:   Provision of jal kund: within few days of cessation of rainy spell, moisture content of the top layer of tilla and sloppy lands decreases rapidly. Jal kund technology could be very useful in such situation, for providing lifesaving irrigation to the seasonal crops during probable long dry spell.   Rice-fish culture: the ecological situation of rice fields in Tripura facilitates the inclusion of fish component especially in saucer shaped lands, lowlands and waterlogged ecosystems. There exists a huge potential for integrated rice-fish farming which can generate additional net returns to the farmers along with higher crop and water productivity.   Cost effective liming technique: huge requirement of liming material is often a big discouragement to the farmers for amelioration of soil acidity. In view of this, ICARNEH perfected the low cost liming technique. With this technique, it is possible to significantly increase the upland crop yields by applying 300-500 kg lime/ha/season.   Vermicomposting: there is no dearth of plant biomass in Tripura. However, farmers are to be encouraged and trained to utilize that abundantly available biomass for making vermicompost. It increases the quality of compost and saves time of compost making.   Crop residue recycling: Studies in AICARP suggested that incorporation of crop residues made it possible to curtail upto 25% of fertilizer NPK requirement of rice. Application of 10-20 kg N ha-1 at the time of incorporation of residues hastened the rate of decomposition, and consequently increased the beneficial effect in terms of grain yield and soil fertility build-up. Since 70-80% of K taken up by these crops is retained in straw component, residue recycling may be the best option to replenish K to the soil and avoid the mining of soil K reserves. Since, Tripura receives frequent rain over a span of 9 months in a year; crop residue recycling could also be an option as its in situ decomposition will not be a problem if managed systemically.
