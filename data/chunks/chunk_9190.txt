 CONSULTANCY ICAR, the apex body for agricultural research, education and extension education SERVICES in the country, is being increasingly looked up to for providing technical expertise inall disciplines of agricultural sciences. For which, a special consultancy/patent cell is being set up at the ICAR Headquarters, New Delhi. CONTRACT SERVICE/ RESEARCH The core group of specialists — scientists, technocrats and professionals — on the panel of the ICAR may shortly be engaged by institutions or individuals in an area of expertise of the institution/organization. The monetary benefit is intended to spread out between the Consultant(s) and the Institution with a part trickling towards the Staff Welfare Fund. A two-way link between the NARS and industry, contract services will be rendered for soil analyses, testing of pesticides/insecticides and seed quality.
