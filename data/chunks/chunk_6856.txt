 Rice variety Swarna Unnat Dhan showed moderately resistant to bacterial leaf blight, false smut, sheath-rot, leaf blast and brown spot diseases and major pests like stem borer, brown-plant- hopper and gall-midge under natural condition. Swarna Unnat Dhan Integrated farming system model for dryland of Karnataka: Ecofriendly integrated farming system model was developed suitable for dryland areas of Karnataka for improving the income of the farmers, better soil health, reducing the consumption of mineral fertilizers through recycling and meeting the human and livestock nutrition. One-acre dryland-based IFS Climate Resilient Agriculture icar annual report 2022-23 143 comprising cropping systems [(ragi + field bean (4:2), maize + redgram (8:2), minor millet (Foxtail millet), and groundnut, orchard (fruits + vegetables) + fodder + boundary plantations (Castor and curry leaf) + livestock (cow-2 and sheep-5)] developed at Kathelgere, Karnataka resulted in improvement in net income by 65.7% ( 52,700/acre) with B:C ratio of 2.68 over maize as sole crop ( 31,800 and 2.21 B:C ratio) practised in dryland systems. About 11,342 kg of residues were recycled back in the system worth 9,102. Quantity of mineral fertilizers saved due to recycling was about Ragi + field bean (4:2) Foxtail millet 127.1 kg urea, 270.7 kg of SSP and 68.9 kg of muriate of potash. IFS model recorded Sustainable Yield and Value index of 0.68 and 0.71, respectively. Greenhouse emission estimation from the model indicates although livestock recorded higher GHG emission (2,086.2 CO2-e in kg) and lowest GHG emission was recorded from border plants (castor and curry leaf) (4.5 CO2-e in kg) and the total GHG source in the system (3,371.6 CO2-e in kg) and sink was (4,487.3 CO2-e.kg), overall negative trend in GHG (-1115.7 CO2-e.kg) was noticed, hence, the system proves to be ecofriendly model. GHG emissions from one acre IFS model Improvement of Yield and Climate Resilience of Rice through Genome Editing Genome-editing technology (CRISPR-Cas9) was used to create loss of function mutants of the Drought and salt tolerance (dst) gene, a Zinc finger transcription factor, in rice cultivar MTU 1010. Three homozygous mutants were developed with reproductive stage tolerance to salinity stress. These lines were further evaluated for yield under drought stress and non-stress conditions. The DST gene mutants showed >25% increase in grain yield under normal conditions due to increase in reproductive tillers per plant and grain number per panicle. Under drought stress (-75 KPa), genome edited mutants showed significantly higher grain yield as compared with MTU 1010. Genome editing of DST gene enhanced grains per panicle and grain yield in rice. Genome editing of DST gene enhanced tolerance to drought stress (-75KPa) of rice.
