The cabbage crop showed similar trend, as was observed in the aged cow urine treatments. The aphid population under control conditions first increased steadily till day 35 and stabilized later on. The number of aphids on treated plants declined significantly after day 15 due to the controlling effect of cow urine. The insignificant difference observed in the number of leaves and plant height, under all concentrations of fresh cow urine shows that these urine treatments have no appreciable effect on the growth of cabbage. The differences are during later stages, though prominent during the earlier stages of crop growth. Fig. 3. Comparative effect of aged and fresh cow urine spray on the number of aphids per plant A comparison of effects between aged and fresh urine treatments indicates that former is more effective than the latter in terms of time taken for complete eradication of the aphid. Eradication under aged cow urine is achieved at day 20, whereas, under fresh cow urine it is effective at day 25. (Fig. 3). Comparative effect of different concentrations of aged buffalo urine spray on aphid population and growth of cabbage The results of this experiment are given in Tables 4 and 5 and Fig. 4.
