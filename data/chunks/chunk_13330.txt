In the organizational context, people and relationships management has many consequences. Improper management results in the reduction of performance efficiency, effectiveness, productivity and communication of employees. When performance efficiency suffers, the quality of the overall organizational environment deteriorates. A deterioration of the organizational environment is accompanied by deterioration in organizational performance. It will have adverse impact on the individual in terms of low morale and poor work relations. People who are chronically having difficulties are lacking in energy and commitment.
