 (b) Two row tractor single bud settling planter A tractor operated two-row sugarcane settling planter Single bud settling planter Light weight paddy thresher-cum-cleaner Single bud cutting machine Light weight paddy thresher cum cleaner The electric motor (0.75 kW) operated light weight paddy thresher cum cleaner for paddy crop consists of main frame, wire loop type threshing unit, blower, sieving unit and power transmission unit. The separation of paddy grain from the straw is achieved due to combing action of the wire loops fitted on the threshing cylinder. The separated grains fall on the vibrating screen through the cleaning duct. A blower is used to blow off the chaff, dust and other light foreign materials from the grain. The vibrating screen separates sand, Loose straw chopper operating in the paddy field before wheat sowing MECHANIZATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016â€“17 88 has been modified for adjustments of spacing and depth of planting. The row to row spacing can be adjusted to 900, 1200 and 1500 mm. The depth of planting can be adjusted from 60 to 100 mm. The plant to plant spacing can be adjusted to 450, 600 and 900 mm. The cost of the equipment is about ` 1.00 lakh. The field capacity of the machine is 0.2 ha/h at 1200 mm spacing with a field efficiency of 70%. Pedal-operated maize dehusker sheller The machine performs operations of dehusking and shelling of maize. The capacity of the machine is 130 kg/h. The dehusking and shelling efficiencies of the dehusker sheller are 97% and 95%, respectively. The cost of the equipment is ` 28,000 (approx.). Package of animal drawn implements for cotton and soybean A package of animal drawn implements for cotton and soybean in animal dominated areas of Malwa Plateau has been developed. An improved bakhar has been used to prepare the field for both the crops. Its field capacity is 13% higher in comparison to conventional blade harrow. It saves 14% of operational time and 10% of operational cost in comparison to conventional bhakhar. Seed drilling with 3- row seed cum fertilizer drill saves 12.5 kg seeds in comparison to tifan seed drilling. For weeding/inter-culture operation in cotton crop, an improved bhakhar of 500 mm is suggested Bullock drawn earthing-up-cum-inter-culturing implement Bullock drawn earthing-up cum inter-culturing implement for sugarcane and turmeric For bullock drawn implements, speed of the operation for inter-culturing, light earthing-up and final earthing- up is 3.0, 2.8 and 1.9 km/h, respectively for sugarcane and 3.1, 2.9, and 2.3 km/h, respectively for turmeric crop. Similarly, field capacity for inter-culturing, light earthing-up and final earthing-up operation is 0.15, 0.14 and 0.12 ha/h, respectively for sugarcane and 0.20, 0.18 and 0.13 ha/h, respectively for turmeric. The average power output for inter-culturing, light earthing-up and final earthing-up was 0.43, 0.54 and 0.40 kW for sugarcane and 0.46 kW, 0.57 kW and 0.
