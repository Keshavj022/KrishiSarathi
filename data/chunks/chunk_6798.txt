 This technology will revolutionize the production of clonal rootstocks in the country from the wasted portion of the plant. By adopting this technology, the cost of rootstock/planting material will get reduced and dependence on import for quality planting material will decline drastically. Different stage of Nursery development using by cuttings in soilless beds under protected conditions Field evaluation of consortia of phosphate solublizing bacteria with different phosphorous level in banana cv. Ney Poovan: Field evaluation of consortia of phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PS1 and PS2) showed that application of 100% single super phosphate (SSP) + PS1 + PS2, recorded 172.44% increase in available phosphorus in soil, and 188.72% increase in available phosphorus in leaf followed by application of 100% rock phosphate (RP) + PS1 + PS2 (158.24% and 159.97% increase in soil and leaf respectively). Besides, application of 100% SSP + PS1+ PS2 improved plant growth characters. Nutrient management in custard apple: Application of 100% RD of N-P2O5-K2O + vermicompost 6 kg per plant was found to maintain sustainability and is recommended by Jadhavwadi Centre to obtain maximum yield and net income for custard apple cv. Purandar Local. Site Specific Nutrient Management: SSNM with secondary (CaSO4.2H2O – 1 kg and MgSO4 – 500 g per palm per year) + Micronutrient mixture (FeSO4, MnSO4, CuSO4, ZnSO4, Borax and ammonoium molybdate) @ 1 kg per palm per year + Coconut frond mulching + Azospirillum – 100 g + Phosphobacteria -100 g + VAM - 100 g per palm per year enhanced productivityby 32% over farmers’ practice in Tender nut variety Chowghat Orange Dwarf. Net Returns and Benefit cost ratio were 4.38 lakhs per ha and 2.99 in INM package as against 3.10 lakhs per ha and 2.66 in farmer’s practice. Scheduling of irrigation and fertigation in guava: Irrigation scheduling to meet 60% evaporation during the vegetative and reproductive phases can realize higher productivity (29.84 t/ha) and water use efficiency (11.86 kg/m3), coupled with a water saving of 2729.10 m3/ha accounting to a saving of 23.57% of water with a water use efficiency of 11.86 kg/m3 in Guava cv. Arka Mridula. Overcoming uneven ripening in grape: To overcome the problem of uneven ripening in grape variety Gulabi, it is recommended to retain 50 bunches per vine and treating bunches with 300 ppm of ethrel at various stage (berry softening) to produce bunches having uniform colour (measured as anthocyanins) and high TSS. Crop Management icar annual report 2022-23 102 Standardization of growth stage wise nutrient and water requirement: Crimson Seedless vines raised on Dogridge rootstock showed that sub-surface irrigation treatment based upon pan evaporation and crop growth stage produced 18.25 t/ha of grapes utilizing only 216.1 mm of irrigation water with highest WUE of 84.4 kg grapes/mm of irrigation water applied.
