 BNCSP (buffalo non-capacitated sperm protein) and BCSP (buffalo capacitated sperm SUPPORTING BASIC AND STRATEGIC RESEARCH ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 168 protein) were used to develop buffalo sperm surface lectome map of buffalo spermatozoa. Performance of elite buffalo bulls developed through animal cloning: Three live and healthy cloned calves were born during the reporting period, and five pregnancies are continuing with more than 6 months of gestation. To improve the cloning efficiency, effects of trichostatin-A (TSA) and 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine on cloned embryos production and its quality were evaluated and combination of these drugs significantly improved cloned embryo production. Further, semen of cloned bulls was utilized for artificial insemination (AI) to generate data on fertility. The preliminary data, generated on methylation pattern of cloned vs IVF generated embryos revealed similar pattern in both source of embryos. The body weight, haematology, serum biochemistry and telomere length of 8 clones born during 2019–20 were evaluated and all parameters were comparable with age matched AI born animals. A total of 15,000 frozen semen doses of cloned bull Hisar-Gaurav and 3,000 of Assamese buffalo cloned bull were produced. The fresh semen of Hisar-Gaurav in 15 oestrous synchronised female buffalo was used in experimental herd out of which 13 got pregnant. Captive breeding of hilsa, Tenualosa ilisha: Five- day-old hatchling of hilsa, reared in freshwater pond (0.003 ha) for 60 days, exhibited better growth (2.39±0.24 g) and survival (30%) in ponds supplemented with PlanktonPlus (75 ppm) along with mustard cake (75 ppm) as plankton booster compared to mustard cake (control) (body weight 1.31±0.09 g; survival 18%). Nursery reared hilsa fry (1.84±0.30 g/5.58±0.40 cm) stocked in grow-out pond (0.15 ha) @ 14,000/ha at Kakdwip were fed with slow sinking crumbled feed (CP- 35% and fat 12%). Fries (50; 7.12±2.21 g/9.09±0.73 cm), recovered after the cyclone Yaas, gained body weight/ length of 35.95±1.73 g/14.7±0.29 cm in 120 days. Four days old spawn (wild bloodstock yielded) exhibited 40% survival in 44 days to fry (19.6 mm/0.06 g); and 126 days to fingerlings (66 mm/2.52 g, 44% survival). At Rahara, fingerlings stocked in ponds (0.1 and 0.4 ha) grew to 9.48–15.8 g in 30 days. Hilsa pond rearing facility (0.4 ha) was established at Kolaghat and stocked with 165 fingerlings (7.6±1.5 g/8.78±0.48 cm). After Yaas, Buffalo spermatozoa by sperm surface remodelling hilsa broodstock development (n=25; 158.84±12.50 g/ 22.85±0.72 cm) was reinitiated in 0.15 ha brackish water pond. Interestingly, similar gonadal maturation (stage-II) was recorded during 03.09.21 to 04.10.2021 in both wild and captive female hilsa; however, captive (GSI: 2.24±0.025) male was one stage ahead to wild (GSI: 0.768±0.002) stock.
