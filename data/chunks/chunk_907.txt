 Carbaryl 10% dust @20–25 kg/ha at 50% flowering and grain formation stage is also suggested in midge endemic areas. • Ear head bugs and head caterpillars: At the milky stage when 1–2 bugs/panicle and head caterpillars (2–3 larvae/panicle), are noticed the crop may be sprayed with cypermethrin 25% EC @0.5 ml/litre. • Cutworms (Mythmina, Spodoptera), red hairy caterpillars, semilooper: For managing these gregarious pests, apply poison baits comprising 10 kg rice bran + 1 kg jaggery + 1 litre quinolphos (25% EC). Prepare small balls and broadcast in the fields preferably in the evening. Another way to kill moving hairy caterpillars, dig out a trench about 1 feet deep, add quinalphos 2% powder at the rate of 25 kg/ha. • Sucking pest (shoot bug, aphids): Apply dimethoate 30% EC @1.5 ml/litre. • Termites: For areas of regular termite occurrence the soil should be mixed with chlorpyriphos 5% dust @35 kg/ White grub Termite ha at the time of sowing and on standing crop mix chlorpyriphos 20% EC @4 litre/ha with 50 kg of soil and broadcast it evenly in 1 ha followed by a light irrigation. • White grub: Incorporate carbofuran 3 g @33.0 kg/ha in the soil before sowing. Seed treatment with chlorpyriphos 20 EC @6.5–12.0 ml/kg or imidacloprid 17.8 SL @2.0 ml/kg seed can be done. Take up early sowing if an irrigation facility is available. Drench the root zone of the crop with chlorpyriphos 20 EC @4.0 litre/ha or quinalphos 25 EC @3.2 litre/ha 3 weeks after the adult emergence. SUMMARY With all their nutritive richness and hardy nature to sustain in unfavourable conditions during growing periods, millets prove themselves a potent choice for future agriculture. Several schemes have been undertaken by the Government of India for increasing the production of millet. However, in millets incurring much cost on pest management is not economically feasible especially on chemicals since it reduces benefit/ cost of crop produced. Community level adoptions of Indigenous Technical knowledge (ITK's) and cultural methods such as early sowing, resistant varieties, judicious nutrient usage etc can help restrict the pest population build-up and the damage caused. The pest scenario also expected to change owing to their dynamic nature, hence, early detection and prompt management actions are needed to be taken-up. It is required that, up-to-date Economic Threshold level (ETL) for each major pest should be determined. Host plant resistance, ecology, evolutionary pest biology, knowledge of the local agro-ecosystem and utilization of natural enemies must become the components of new IPM strategy for holistic management of pests in millets. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: anokhearchana12@gmail.
