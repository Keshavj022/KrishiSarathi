Identification of resistance source to neck and finger blast disease from finger millet: A total 225 hill collections of finger millet germplasm were evaluated against leaf, neck and finger blast disease under natural field conditions. Based on scoring pattern, it was observed that none of the germplasm was highly resistant to leaf blast disease. Neck blast incidence ranged from 0 to 86% and finger blast incidence from 0 to 40%. Entries VHC 3796, VHC 4085, VRB MF 1217, VL 324, VR MF 1516 and VL Ragi 149 were highly resistant to both neck and finger blast while moderately resistant to leaf blast. Twenty-one entries (VHC 3899, VHC 4168, VHC 3603, VHC 3637, VHC 4149, VHC 4167, VHC 4006, VHC 3641, VRS MF 859, VRB MF 1214, VHC 4134, VHC 3640, VRB MF 1575, VHC 4084, VHC 4136, VHC 4180, VHC 4087, VHC 3975, VRB MF 1817, VRB MF 1819 and VHC 3583) were highly resistant to neck blast and moderately resistant to leaf and finger blast.
