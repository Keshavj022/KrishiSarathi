Average plant height and number of green leaves were higher in implement method of sowing than farmer’s method. However, average bulb yield of onion was 424.4 q/ha in case of farmer’s method and 321.8 q/ha in case of implement method (Table 1). A net return of Rs 118917/ha was obtained by sowing onion by the implement which was Rs 1,57,946/ha in farmers method. Lucerne: Observations on stand establishment, recorded in lucerne indicated that there was upto 98% germination. Forage yield of Lucerne in 5 cuttings was 563.9 q/ha by using the seed drill which was 498.2 q/ha in farmers’ method. Net income in implement method and farmers’ method were Rs 97,535 and Rs 86,645/ha, respectively CONCLUSION Results of the experiments suggest that use of seed-drill is advantageous to raising lucerne which is not true in case of onion.  GRAIN/SEED STORAGE Code : 1463 Title of the ITK : Control of insect-pest infestation in stored grains/seeds through use of sinduar (Vitex negundo) leaves Description of the ITK : Insect/pest attacks on the seed grains are very common. It is controlled by sinduar leaves. Sinduar leaves are dried and mixed with grains for storage. One kg sinduar leaf is required to store 100 kg food grains. By the help of this practice, 70_75% food grains are saved from grain weevil. This is in practice for last 40 years by maximum number of farmers in the Nawada district of Bihar. Name and address of the discloser : Shri Md. Mahmood Alam, Tikodih, Paharpur, Kawakol, Nawada (Bihar) Location of use of the ITK : In and around Sokhodeora and other villages of Nawada district (Bihar) Geographical indicators : Vitex negundo is a large aromatic shrub with quadrangular, densely whitish, tomatoes branchlet, upto 4.5 m in height or some time a small, slender tree, found through out the greater parts of India ascending to an altitude of 1500 m in outer Himalayas.
