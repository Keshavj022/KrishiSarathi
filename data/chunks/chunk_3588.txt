 Healthy sucker (1-2/ plant) are plucked from the 2-5 year plantations leaving another healthy sucker on the mother plant in the mother block for ratoon crop in the next season. All the overgrown leaves of the plugged suckers are clipped to 20-25 cm length and treated by dipping in insecticide in a tank with chlorpyriphos/imidacloprid/quinalphos (1.0 ml/L water) for 10-15 min or spraying with these insecticides. Thereafter, all the treated suckers are spread on the ground under semi-shade conditions for curing for 7-8 days more, so that extra water from the sucker tissues is lost. Planting after proper curing is good for maximum plant survival and minimum rotting of the suckers. PLANTING SYSTEM UNDER WEED MAT TECHNOLOGY Field preparation: Field is thoroughly ploughed and is made friable by light ploughing after mixing organic manures. Raised beds of 1.8-2.0 m width, 15-25 cm height and length 100 m or as per land availability are prepared. One meter spacing is kept between each bed for ease of movement in the grown-up planation. Inorganic fertilizers 180 kg urea, 80 kg SSP and 180 kg MOP are applied per hectare basis at the time of bed preparation along with organic manure (@ 15-20 t/ha). Under the organic culture system, 50-60 T/ha FYM and 10-15 T/ha vermicompost are required to meet the total nutrient requirement per year. Apart from these organic manures, FYM treated with Trichoderma formulations (@ 300g/100kg FYM) is beneficial for protection from diseases. Application of neem cake @ 50-60 t/ha, rock phosphate @ 400-450 kg/ha and bone meal 650-700 kg/ha at the time of final bed preparation. Biofertilizers such as Azotobacter (@ 200g/100 kg FYM) and PSB (@ 200 g/100 kg FYM) are mixed with FYM and incubated for 48 hrs or 4 days and incorporated in the soil at the time of planting. Weed mat mulching on the beds: U.V stabilized high-density polyethylene (HDPE) weed mats with size 2.5 × 100-200 m and 90-100 gsm thickness are laid over the properly levelled beds covering the beds from all sides. So that soil on the beds is also protected from loosening Biswajit Das1, H Lembisana Devi, Bapi Das, A G Devi, Vinay Singh, Pradip Sarkar, Ashima Suklay Baidya Technology January–February 2024 7 or draining out. Normal black-silver polyethene mulching films have not been found suitable for pineapple under Tripura conditions as these are fragile and are damaged in successive years especially due to cultural operations, harvesting, de-suckering and also by rats. Planting of suckers: Under Tripura condition recommended system is 30 × 60 × 90 cm (43,500 plants/ ha or 7000 plants/kani) or 30 × 60 × 1.0 m (43,050 plants/ ha or 6,932 plants/kani). Holes on the mat are made as per the planting spacing plan. The best procedure is to fix a plastic string from one end to another end on the weed mat at 60 cm gap as per the planting layout and thereafter 15-20 cm long bamboo or plastic pegs are fixed at 30 cm spacing along the string.
