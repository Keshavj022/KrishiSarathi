 SUMMARY Horticultural produce is highly perishable, requiring careful handling during harvesting, transportation, and storage to maintain quality for human consumption. Without proper handling, these products decay quickly, making them unfit for consumption. Poorly collected and transported produce deteriorates even faster in storage, accelerating spoilage. Effective processing is essential for maintaining the quality of fresh fruits and vegetables. The FFP team at ICAR-CIPHET, Ludhiana, has undertaken various initiatives to improve post- harvest handling, including identifying and training farmers, setting up on-farm facilities, and developing a packhouse. This packhouse, costing around ` 5 lakh, handles cleaning, sorting, grading, and packaging, thereby enhancing the produce’s marketability by preserving its freshness and quality. Packhouses play a vital role in reducing food waste by employing processes like cleaning, pre-cooling, and proper packaging to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables, ensuring more produce reaches the market in good condition. This minimizes losses that typically arise from improper handling, storage, and transportation. ICAR-CIPHET’s efforts also include promoting value-added products, like vegetable pickles, to boost farmer incomes. By utilizing surplus produce that might otherwise go to waste, processes such as pickle production add substantial value. As a result of ICAR- CIPHET’s interventions, farmers have achieved a value addition of 18 to 22%, reducing waste at various stages of the supply chain by transforming raw horticultural produce into shelf-stable, marketable goods. *Corresponding author email: Sandeep.Mann@icar.gov.in Skill development training on 'On-farm handling and packaging of horticultural produce' for 15 vegetable growing farmers at Patran, Patiala Exposure visit of FPO members from SBS Nagar to ICAR-CIPHET, Ludhiana Rationale of the intervention The agricultural policy of the country is primarily designed by the government to raise agricultural production, productivity, and farmers’ income and standard of living within a defined timeframe. Post-harvest processing is a crucial step for adding value, preventing losses, and transforming agricultural produce. Shri Paramjit Singh Khalsa, a farmer from Balachour, SBS Nagar, Punjab, was farming on 8 acres of leased land. He grew cereals (wheat and maize), pulses (moong, masur, and chana), turmeric, and vegetables like bottle gourd, bitter gourd, carrot, radish, cauliflower, turnip, onion, potato, tomato, spinach, and coriander. He sold his produce to middlemen and local mandis, earning around `3,00,000 in profit. Interested in enhancing his income through on-farm processing, he received training under the Farmers FIRST Programme (FFP) from ICAR-CIPHET, Ludhiana, focusing on entrepreneurship development and processing technologies.
