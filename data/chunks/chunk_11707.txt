CS26 i Name of the Society: Indian Society of Genetics and Plant Breeding ii Title: First National Genetics Congress on Genetics for Sustainable Food, Health and Nutrition Security iii Venue and Date(s): Dr. B.P. Pal Auditorium, Indian Agricultural, Research Institute, New Delhi-110012 14-16 December, 2018 iv Amount of grant by ICAR Rs. 5.00Lakhs v ICAR's Sanction no. F.No.23 (38)/2018-Cdn. (Tech.) CROP SCIENCE Compendium Salient Recommendations 28 vi Recommendations:   Public sector plant breeding is facing serious challenges especially in cotton, maize, vegetable and floricultural crops. It is, therefore, recommended that a one-day brain storming workshop be organized to discuss this issue.   Greater emphasis is laid on identification and mapping of OTL (check QTL)? for Abiotic stresses and for productivity traits, and assembling of QTL with diverse mechanisms through MAS in important crops.   Strengthening of research is needed on the development of transgenic and to establish a single central facility for undertaking bio-safety and IPR issues.   Strengthening of research in functional genomics and bioinformatics with a major focus on annotating gene functions and utilization of RNA technology for nutritional enhancement be given priority.   Use of off-season nurseries should be an integral part of a breeding program in order to speed up the breeding cycle.   In crops such as wheat, maize, basmati rice, and some vegetables where feasibility of DH approach has been demonstrated, the operation needs to be scaled up or initiated as the case may be.
