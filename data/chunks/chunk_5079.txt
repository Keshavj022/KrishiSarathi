Participatory rural appraisal and field survey were done in village Sanakhairimal, Bhawanipatna, dist. Kalahandi (Orissa) and experiment was conducted at Department of Horticulture, Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology, Bhubaneshwar, Orissa and village Sanakhairimal, P.O. Karlaguda, Bhawanipatna, Kalahandi (Orissa). PRA and field study The survey to determine the performance of the ITK method as compared to fermentation method. The survey was done with 15 farmers of village Sanakhairimal on different parameters, i.e. seed quality, time consumption, seed germination and plant growth.  HORTICULTURAL CROPS Experiment Experiments were conducted at two sites. The main site comprised the village Sanakhairimal, where breeder seeds of variety BT-10 (wilt tolerant variety) was provided. The second site was at Horticulture Department, OUAT where only ripe fruits of tomato were purchased and seed extraction was taken up as per the treatments. Three treatments, i.e. (i) seed extraction by use of rice bran ITK), (ii) seed extraction by use of fermentation method, and (iii) seed extraction by that ITK method (use of rice bran) is less time consuming, having good seed quality with higher germination percentage than fermentation method; whereas both the methods were found to be easy and having similar plant-growth characteristics. Experiment It was found that seed extracted by rice bran method was quite superior in seed colour and germination percentage with better recovery of Table 1.

The experiment was laid out in CRD design to study (i) seed colour, (ii) germination percentage, (iii) seed recovery and (iv) duration required for seed extraction. PRA and field study It is revealed from the data presented in Table1 seeds than fermentation and HCl methods. Dilute HCl method consumed lesser time than the ITK method.
