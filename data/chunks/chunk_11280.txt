Brinjal yy Seeds of brinjal should be treated with carbendazim @2gm per kg of seeds to protect the crop from seed borne diseases. As a biocontrol measure, seed also can be treated with pseudomonas fluroscence or trichoderma viridi @10gm per kg of seed. yy Before transplanting, apply 110 kg of Urea, 376 kg of SSP & 96 kg MOP per hactre. Spacing of brinjal seedling should be kept 60 cm both row to row & plant to plant. yy For brinjal shoot & fruit borer imamectin benjoyet 5% SG @ 100 gm/acre or dimethoate 30% EC @660 ml/ha should be applied. 154 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy To control shoot & fruit borer crop rotation with crops other than solanaceous crops should be followed as a cultural practice. yy Pheromon trap 12 nos./ha land can be used to control brinjal fruit & shoot borer. Chilli yy Chilli seedling should be planted at a distance of 60 cm x 60 cm in the main field. yy Before transplanting apply 65 kg urea, 260 kg SSP and 40 kg MOP per hectare. Another 65 kg Urea can be applied 30 days after transplanting after loosening of soil. yy White fly which is the vector of viral diseases can be controlled by spraying dimethoate 30% EC @660 ml/ha yy Thrips may attack chilli.
