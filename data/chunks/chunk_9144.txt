The Diamond-back moth severely damages the tropical cole crops. For which, an integrated pest management schedule has been standardized. Development of kharif onions LIGHT RED, N53, ARKA KALYAN and AGRI- FOUND have expanded the availability of the crop, particularly in northern India.

InIndia, the okra (Hibiscus esculentus Linn.) occupies 369,684 hectares next only to chillies (738,000 hectares), the largest cultivated vegetable crop, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Bihar and West Bengal lead in its cultivation. The immature tender green fruits of the tropical vegetable, rich in calcium (90 mg/100 g of fresh weight) are eaten fresh, dehydrated, frozen or canned, It is exported chiefly to the Middle-East, Gulf and western Europe. Yellow-vein mosaic virus (YVMV) can devastate up to 93.3 per cent of the crop. Fusarium and low temperature stresses are the other limiting factors.
