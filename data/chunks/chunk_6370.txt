CROP IMPROVEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 33 (2n=2x=18) having a genome size of 710 Mb. Complete chloroplast genome of 151 kb size of winged bean was sequenced. It has a typical quadripartite structure, with the Cp genome divided into LSC and SSC of 82,736 bp and 17,777 bp in size, respectively, and a pair of IRs of 25,529 bp. The GC content of the winged bean chloroplast genome has a 35.26%, and the GC content of LSC, SSC, and IR regions was 32.63, 28.55 and 41.86 %, respectively. A total of 130 genes are found in the winged bean Cp genome; among these 85 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. There are 61 protein-coding and 22 tRNA genes located in the LSC region, 12 protein-coding and 1tTRNA genes located in the SSC region, 6 protein-coding, 7 tRNA, and 4 rRNA genes located in the IRA region gene, and a similar set of genes as present in IR-A is duplicated in IRB. The ycf2 is the largest protein-coding gene having 6,869 bp in size, while rps2 is the protein-coding smallest gene having 68 bp in size. trnK-UUU is the largest tRNA gene having 2657 bp in size, while trnC-GCA is the smallest tRNA gene having 78bp in size. A total of 8 rRNA genes were present in the winged bean chloroplast and resided in the IR region of the Cp genome. The rrn23 is the largest rRNA gene 2,820 bp in size and is present in both IRA and IRB regions.
