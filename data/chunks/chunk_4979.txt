 As the banana is sensitive to moisture stress, it shows symptoms of water deficiency earlier than sugarcane. Farmers apply irrigation when the water-stress deficiency in banana is noticed. By this practice, farmers in Karadabadi village of Ganjam in Orissa save 15 to 20% water and are able toprovide irrigation to sugarcane crop in time, resulting in 10 to 15% higher yield of sugarcane as compared to normal practice of irrigation indiscriminately. About 90% of the farmers in the village adopt this practice.

Mohapatra, Training Assistant, KVK, Bhanjanagar (Orissa) METHODOLOGY Location Evaluation of efficacy of banana as an indicator plant for irrigation in sugarcane was done by Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and field survey in village A Karadabadi, Buguda, dist. Ganjam (Orissa) 761 127. PRA and field study The PRA was conducted to determine the Table 1.

The parameters were: number of tillers / plant, number of internodes/plant, length of cane/plant, single-cane weight, brix, cane yield, number of irrigations and germination (%) of setts. Experiments An experiment was conducted with the following three treatments: (i) random flood irrigation (ii) ITK method (providing irrigation on wilting of banana leaves and (iii) providing irrigation as per schedule at 50% soil moisture. Date of planting of setts was 15 February 2003. The experiment was laid out in CRD design with 10 replications.
