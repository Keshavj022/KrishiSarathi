0%) The technical parameters considered for observation were: (i) insect pest infestation pattern, (ii) varietal difference in pest infestation and response to ITK, (iii) pest reduction percentage and (iv) impact on healthy crop stand. The economic parameters were: yield and cost- benefit analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study The mean value of ranking by farmers revealed that the ITK (application of extracts of garlic and tobacco leaves and extracts of leaves of neem) efficiently managed the pest and saved the loss in yield (Table 1).
