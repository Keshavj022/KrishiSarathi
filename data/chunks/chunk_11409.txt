 The seeds should be treated with fungicides (2 g thiram + 1 g carbendazim kg-1 seed) before sowing for reducing seed and soil borne fungal diseases. If chickpea is being grown for the first time, the seeds should be inoculated with Rhizobium culture. The doses of fertilizers should be determined based on the results of soil test. The generally recommended doses for chickpea include 20–30 kg nitrogen (N) and 40–60 kg phosphorus (P) ha- If soils are low in potassium (K), an application of 17 to 25 kg K ha-1 is recommended. Foliar spray of 2% urea at flowering has been found beneficial in rainfed crops. Basal application of Zinc Sulfate (ZnSO4) at 10-25 kg ha-1 is found to give positive response. Foliar application of 0.5% Zinc Sulfate mixed with 0.25% lime also effective in zinc deficiency, 0.5% (w/v) ferrous sulphate in iron deficiency and soil application of 1.0-2.5 kg Borax ha-1 or foliar application of 0.25 kg Borax ha-1 helps in correcting Boron deficiency. Seed treatment with ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 143 3.5 g sodium molybdate is found to have beneficial effect in chickpea Chickpea is generally grown as a rainfed crop, but two irrigations, one each at branching and pod filling stages, are recommended for higher yield. Chickpea is a poor competitor with weeds at all stages of growth. Pre-emergence herbicides, such as Fluchloralin @ 1 kg a.i. per ha. effective control. Mechanical and/or manual weeding can be done where wide row spacing is used. Fusarium wilt is a vascular disease that causes browning and blackening of xylem. Its control by use resistant varieties (JG 11, JAKI 9218, JG 130, KAK 2, JGK 1, JGK 2), deep ploughing and seed treatment with Trichoderma viride @ 4 g kg-1 seed. Collar rot control by crop rotations with cereals, use resistant varieties (eg, PBG 1, BG 267, GNG 146), seed treatment and 2-3 sprays of mancozeb or chlorothalonil @ 2-3 g L-1 water. Growing high yielding wilt resistant varieties, KWR 108, DCP 92-3, Pusa 256, Vardan. JG 315, Alok, Karnal Chana-1 and Surya under normal condition and Udai, Pusa 372, and Pusa 256 under late sown. Kabuli chickpea variety Pusa 1003 in eastern region and JGK 1 and KAK 2 for Bundelkhand region Application of either NPV @ 250 LE (larval equivalents) per ha when the egg/larval population reaches economic threshold level, or 5% neem fruit powder extract (about 15 kg neem fruit powder per ha.) provide effective control of pod borer. Application of chemical sprays (endosulfan @ 350 g a.i. ml ha-1 indoxacarb @ 70 ml a.i. ha-1 or spinosad @ 45 ml a.i. ha-1) can be applied as and when needed. The crop should be harvested when leaves start to senesce and start shedding, pods turn yellow, plants dry, seed hard and rattles within the pod. After harvest, the plants can be dried in the sun for a few ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 144 days. Threshing can be done using commercially available power threshers.
