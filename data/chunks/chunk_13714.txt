 Putrescine application was particularly effective under stress condi- tions, such as high salinity, where it helps plants maintain their performance. This study highlights putrescine as a promising tool for improving crop tolerance and growth. Finally, in a comprehensive review article, Boulogne et al. (2024) introduced the concept of “glycostimulation”, identifying glycomolecules such as polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids as a distinct and versatile category of biostimulants. These compounds may play the dual role of enhancing plant response mechanisms against both abiotic and biotic stresses while simultaneously promoting growth. This unique combination of benefits positions glycomolecules as a promising focus for advancing agricultural productivity and plant health, offering a bridge between stress resilience and improved yield potential. 4 | CONCLUSION Biostimulants are transforming modern agriculture by providing diverse and innovative strategies to enhance nutrient acquisition, biomass pro- duction, stress tolerance, and overall crop performance. The studies assembled in this Special Issue demonstrate how biostimulants regulate plant growth, development, and quality traits of different crop species at various developmental stages, from early vegetative stages to repro- ductive transitions, showcasing their ability to improve productivity and sustainability. Biostimulants have shown their multifaceted role in addressing key agricultural challenges through molecular modulation, microbial integration, and the application of seaweed-derived products. Advanced formulations and novel mechanisms, such as glycostimulation and nanoparticle-based products, are redefining how we manage crops, offering new perspectives for sustainable farming. These findings underscore the growing importance of biostimulants in real-world agricultural applications, especially in overcoming challenges posed by climate change and resource limitations. By bridging scientific discovery with practical implementation, biostimulants provide valuable tools to create resilient, productive, and environmentally friendly farming systems, making them an important part of the future of agriculture. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the ability of biostimulants to challenge various abiotic stresses through mechanisms that include improved antioxidant activity, ionic balance, osmotic regulation, and transcriptional reprogramming, underscoring their potential as a sus- tainable tool for enhancing crop resilience in challenging environmental conditions while preserving or promoting growth and quality.
