 Botanical garden/field gene banks: Botanical garden/field gene bank are used to conserve those species which lose their viability during seed gene bank storage. There are many field gene banks/botanical gardens maintained by government and non-governmental organizations in India. National biodiversity authority (NBA), an autonomous and statutory body of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India listed existence of 109 botanical gardens across 18 states in Fig. 6. Distribution of Sacred groves across the country Fig. 7. Ex situ conservation strategies Fig. 8. Representative pics of ex situ conservation strategies Farmer’s role in conservation: Farmers are also playing an important role in conserving the biodiversity by “cultivating a diverse set of crops in the agro- ecosystems where either the crops have originated or are secondary center of diversity”, this is known as “On-farm conservation” which is a part of in situ conservation strategies. On-farm conservation requires a multidisciplinary approach, i.e. (I) socio-economic research to understand and analyse farmers’ knowledge; (II) population and conservation biology; (III) studies on the dynamics of the local landraces and farmer’s varieties to understand population differences, gene flow, degree of inbreeding, selection pressure etc.; (IV) crop improvement research in mass selection and simple breeding methods and (V) extension studies for lesser-known crops and varieties for their seed production, marketing and distribution. Ex situ conservation Conservation of plant genetic resources outside their natural habitat is known as ex situ conservation. It facilitates conservation in controlled conditions and makes possible No. of documented Sacred Forests 2820 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 1275 1476 677 329 1096 560 562 5713332 16 166 170 105 188 108 92 29 57 42 93 63 43 29 159 Andhra Pradesh Arunachal Pradesh Assam Bihar Chhattisgarh Goa Gujarat Haryana Himachal Pradesh Jammu & Kashmir Jharkhand Karnataka Kerala Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra Manipur Meghalaya Odisha Puducherry Rajasthan Sikkim Tamil Nadu Telangana Uttarakhand Uttar Pradesh West Bengal Seed gene bank Cryo gene bank In vitro gene bank Field gene bank Indian Horticulture 28 India (source: http://nbaindia.org/link/241/34/1/SBBs. html). Ministry of Agriculture under horticultural division has established 16 herbal gardens all over India which are maintaining about 150 medicinal plants. Botanical garden at ICAR-DMAPR, Anand in an area of about 10 ha maintains 140 tree species, 65 shrubs, 40 creepers and 250 herbs and at field gene bank 2313 accessions of 20 medicinal plant species including 9 mandated crops are (Source: Annual Report 2022, DMAPR).
