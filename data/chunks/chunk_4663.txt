 Thrips is a major pest of onion. Spray with fipronil 5 SC @ 1 ml/l of water or carbosulfan 25% EC @ 2 ml/l of water is effective to control thrips. Sticker is to be used during rainy season. Cloudy weather and dew formation favours fungal diseases like root rot, damping off, wilt etc. Spray the seedlings with mancozeb @ 2.5 g or hexaconazole 1 g/l of water to control black and brown blight diseases. Stagnation of water and inadequate drainage favours seedling root rot (fungal disease) in nursery. Root rot can be controlled by drenching of copper oxychloride @ 3 g/l of water. Drenching of metalaxyl 4% + mancozeb 64% @ 2 g/l of water between the rows controls wilt and damping off fungal diseases. Seedling may becomes yellow due to heavy nutrient loss through leaching therefore, foliar spray of 19:19:19 and micronutrients mixture (Zn 3%, Fe 2.5%, Mn 1%, Cu 1% and B 0.5%) at 20 days after sowing as per the recommended dose or scientists advise can control the deficiencies. Kharif (rainy) season onion crop should be always transplanted on raised bed. About 40-45 days age old seedlings should be transplanted in the main field at spacing 15 × 10 cm. Seedlings of 0.8-0.9 cm in stem diameter and 20-35 cm height are optimum for transplanting. One third top portion of the seedlings is to be cut at the time of transplanting. Over-aged seedlings if planted results in more bolting, more double bulbs, thick neck bulbs or small size bulbs. In case of younger seedlings, establishment seems poor. It is recommended for dipping of onion seedling roots into solution of fungicide carbendazim @ 1 g/l of water and insecticide carbosulfan @ 2 ml/l of water before transplanting for 2 h to control pest and diseases. The duration of seedlings root dipping may be changed as per recommendations of State Agricultural Universities and can be confirmed by the experts. Nutrient management Ideal nutrient requirement depends upon soil type, available nutrient status of the soil and removal of nutrients by crop, etc. A nutrient management practice differs as per soil nutrient availability status. For normal Fe deficiency Zn deficiency Mn deficiency Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC @ 1 ml/l of water with quizalofop ethyl 5% EC @ 1 ml/l of water @ 25 DAT +1 hand weeding at 45 DAT. Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC at 1-1.5 ml/l of water at transplanting + 1 hand weeding at 30 DAT Control (without weed management practices) Weed management practices affects onion bulb size (T7 with weed management; T8, control). March–April 2021 19 crops, it is essential to keep the crop weed free, especially 30-45 days from transplanting. Crop weed competition is recorded higher from transplanting till almost 45 days, it may reduce yield up to 60%. Application of weedicide oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC @ 1.5 ml/l of water before transplanting or 8-10 days after transplanting using flat nozzle sprayers followed by one hand weeding at 30 days after transplanting efficiently controls weeds in onion. Spray of oxyfluorfen 23.
