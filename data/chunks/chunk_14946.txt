 The negative impact of CC could lead to a reduction in the productivity of various crops by 3–7 % for every one-degree rise in mean temperature [4,5], thereby * Corresponding author. ** Corresponding author.

Small and marginal farmers constitute approximately 86 percent of the total number of farmers in India [7]. The impacts of CC affect small farmers more significantly than large farmers [8]. With large farmers having a greater capacity to adapt to CC than small and marginal farmers, the latter group is more vulnerable to CC [9]. CC significantly impacts labor productivity, not only within the agricultural sector but also across various other economic sectors. Srinivasa Rao et al. [10] estimated that global warming might result in a loss of around 5.8 % of working hours, potentially leading to the loss of approximately 34 million full-time jobs, primarily in the construction and agricultural sectors. Additionally, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused further disruptions in the agricultural sector, exacerbating the situation created by the adverse impact of CC [11]. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on farmers, particularly small-scale farmers, was more pronounced in contexts characterized by less mechanization in the agricultural sector and a weak procurement system for agricultural produce [12]. The impacts of CC on agriculture vary across different regions in India [13]. Projections suggest an increase in extreme rainfall events in western and south-central areas [14]. Summer monsoon rainfall is expected to decline, while winter rainfall is anticipated to increase in northwestern regions, such as arid western Rajasthan and adjacent areas in Punjab and Haryana [15]. This could lead to higher incidences of droughts and floods, affecting both the rainy season crops (kharif), typically sown from June to July and harvested from September to October, and the winter season crops (rabi), usually planted from October to December and harvested from April to June [16]. A perception study in the Brahmaputra basin in India found that farmers believe CC contributes to recurring floods, landslides, droughts, and crop and livestock diseases [17]. The adverse impact of CC could potentially reduce agricultural yields in India 4.5–9% annually during the 2020–2039 period [18]. If translated into monetary terms, this could result in an annual GDP reduction of between 0.7 % and 1.35 % [10,19]. The impact of CC can be significantly mitigated with proper CC adaptation [20].
