11 (0–5 cm) to 1.38 ± 0.01 (20–25 cm) g cm−3 for the forest, 1.14 ± 0.01 (0–5 cm) to 1.27 ± 0.05 (25–30 cm) g cm−3 for ZT, 1.18 ± 0.07 (0–5 cm) to 1.43 ± 0.02 (25–30 cm) g cm−3 for RT and 1.25 ± 0.05 (0–5 cm) to 1.42 ± 0.07 (10–15 cm) g cm−3 for CT. In the topsoil layer, the lowest ρb was noticed in forest land usage, followed by ZT, RT, and CT, respectively, and the ρb of CT was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than forest and ZT. Up to 15 cm soil depth, the ρb of CT was significantly higher than all other land uses. Beyond 15 cm soil depth, the ρb did not vary significantly among soil depths for all four land use practices. The rising trend of soil bulk density with soil depth was also reported (Mehler et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2020), and it may be due to lesser SOM content and less microbial activity at deeper depths. The lowest soil bulk density in forest land and ZT may be attributed to the perennial plant cover, continued litter addition and crop residue retention, etc., accompanied by a minimal mechanical disturbance that avoids soil compaction and increased SOC input (Kabir et al., 2020). The bulk density was inversely related to SOC (Don et al., 2007), and its variation also followed a similar trend as SOC for all land uses. Due to the use of frequent heavy farming equipment (Patra et al., 2019b) for primary and secondary tillage followed by compaction of soil (Havaee et al., 2014) and a decrease in total porosity, lowering of SOC and earthworm activity (Li et al., 2021) higher bulk density was observed in CT, and RT land uses as compared to forest and ZT. Likewise, the influence of various land-use practices on soil aggre­ gate MWD is visible, as presented in Fig. 3. In the topsoil layer, the forest soil had significantly (p < 0.05) higher MWD (mm) (3.76 ± 0.56) among all other treatments, likely due to higher SOC and stable aggregate. It was followed by ZT having significantly (p < 0.05) higher MWD (1.87 ± 0.12) as compared to RT (1.04 ± 0.05) and CT (0.78 ± 0.03). However, beyond 5 cm soil depth, the CT, RT, and ZT did not vary significantly, although it was significantly different from forest lands. With the in­ crease in soil depth, a decline in MWD was observed for all the land uses. It was observed that a decrease (79%) in MWD of CT was observed after conversion from forest land to CT; however, the decrease was only 50% in the case of the adoption of ZT. The MWD varied from 3.76 ± 0.56 (0–5 cm) to 0.70 ± 0.11 (25–30 cm) for the forest, 1.87 ± 0.12 (0–5 cm) to 0.53 ± 0.06 (25–30 cm) for ZT, 1.10 ± 0.24 (5–10 cm) to 0.46 ± 0.03 (25–30 cm) for RT and 0.80 ± 0.01(10–15 cm) to 0.47 ± 0.01 (25–30 cm) for CT. Higher aggregate stability in terms of MWD for ZT and RT than CT indicates that the improved soil structure leads to low soil erosion due to less soil disturbance and reduced aggregate disruption (Liu et al., 2020). The higher water-stable aggregation in the forest (3.76 ± 0.56 mm) and conservation agriculture (1.87 ± 0.
