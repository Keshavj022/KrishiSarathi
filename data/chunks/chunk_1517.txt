 By leveraging drought-tolerant crops, efficient water management techniques like drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting, in addition to sustainable practices, this approach enables the cultivation of diverse fruits, vegetables, and medicinal crops under limited water conditions. Dryland horticulture enhances food security, promotes farmer income, and fosters resilience against climate change through agroforestry, crop diversification, and climate-smart crop selection. Successful examples from India's drylands underscore the potential of this method to boost economic stability and local biodiversity while supporting environmental sustainability. Government initiatives and research are pivotal in overcoming challenges, expanding access to resources, and mitigating risks for farmers. With further investment and support, dryland horticulture could transform arid landscapes into productive hubs, offering sustainable solutions to global food and water demands. Keywords: Climate change, Drylands, Food security, Horticulture Dryland horticulture I N a world increasingly threatened by climate change and water scarcity, dryland horticulture offers a promising pathway to transform arid and semi-arid regions into productive landscapes. These areas, which make up a significant portion of the world’s landmass (In India, 68% of the cultivated area is under dryland agriculture, contributing about 44% to the country’s total food production), are often seen as inhospitable for farming due to limited water availability and poor soil quality. Dryland horticulture refers to the cultivation of fruit, vegetables, and other horticultural crops in regions characterized by low rainfall and limited water resources. Unlike traditional horticultural practices that rely on consistent rainfall or irrigation, dryland horticulture utilizes drought-tolerant crops, efficient water management techniques, and innovative farming practices to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. This method is becoming increasingly important in areas affected by climate variability and water shortages, providing farmers with a sustainable way to boost productivity. By focusing on crops that can survive with minimal water, farmers can not only sustain their livelihoods but also mitigate the risks associated with climate change and erratic weather patterns. Indian Farming 75 (01): 43-47; January 2025 Dryland horticulture presents a promising solution for enhancing farmer income and building resilience against environmental challenges, while promoting sustainable land use and resource management. Importance of dryland horticulture in arid regions Dryland horticulture is essential in arid and semi-arid regions, where water scarcity and unpredictable rainfall present significant challenges to traditional horticulture.
