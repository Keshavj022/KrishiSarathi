 Significant findings of the Vivekananda Parvatiya Krishi Anusandhan Sansthan, Almora, had been the release of Vivek Dhan 82 rice for hills of Uttaranchal, Himachal Pradesh and Meghalaya, and the identification of promising lines one each in barnyard millet, garlic, field pea, spring rice, wheat and barley; multiplication of 9.68 tonnes truthfully labeled seeds of improved varieties and their distribution among hill farmers; existence of congenial environment for growing broccoli, knol-khol, lettuce and parsley; identification of resistance sources against major diseases in rice, wheat, maize and garden pea; confirmation of rockphosphate as a better source of P for cauliflower; and better performance of improved grasses than local ones for fodder production in hills. Superiority of intercropped ginger to its sole crop; identification of agri-horti-sylvi-pastoral model for north- east region; and preparation of fermented products made from edible shoots of bamboo without preservatives with storage period of six months to two years, are the highlights of the ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Umiam. The National Agricultural Technology Project, being implemented by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and Department of Agriculture and Co- operation (DAC), has three major components, viz. Research, Organization and Management, and Innovations in Technology Dissemination. In Production system research, 264 subprojects were approved besides 70 IVLP centres. Some of the important achievements in irrigated agro-ecosystem include identification and release of two quality protein maize hybrids Shaktiman 1 and Shaktiman 2; significant increase in seed-cotton yield by wheat-straw incorporation; development of seeder-cutter/planter machine for sowing or planting wheat and sugarcane in single pass of tractor; standardization of process for oilpalm fibre extraction from empty bunches; development of manually operated coconut-splitting device; identification of suitable rice- based cropping system for salt-affected coastal soils; development of broodstock for Penaeus monodon and P. indicus, rotary ball mill for shaping molluscan and a machine for making feed blocks of residues of different crops are the major findings in coastal agro-ecosystem. Under hill and mountain agro-ecosystem, the salient features are the constructions of gauzing stations to monitor run-off and soil loss in small watersheds; adoption of integrated rice-fish-piggery-duckery farming system by tribal farmers; control of nasal schistosomiosis in cross- bred cattle; development of new inoculants technology in the form of liquid rhizobium inoculant; and high regeneration capacity of M 35-1 sorghum in tissue culture.
