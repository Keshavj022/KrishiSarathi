 Considering the HV of MeOH as 22.7 MJ/kg, the MeOH energy potential in India is estimated to be 1.86 EJ, which is equivalent to 4.82% of the country’s primary energy consumption in 2018. Uttar Pradesh alone has a production capacity of 20.89% of the estimated total national MeOH production. 4. Comparative analysis, strength and limitations A limited number of studies have been found focusing on evaluating India’s agricultural biomass and bioenergy potential in the last two decades. Table 4 shows a comparative analy- sis of data found in the literature from 2005 to the present. Different types of data, viz., year of study, method of study, region, crop production data source, number of studied crops and total residues, highest residue producing crops, estimated gross residue, and estimated surplus residue data, were analysed and compared with the present study. In terms of effective estimation of bioenergy and syngas production potential from 43 major crop residues generated from 28 major crops throughout India in 2017–18, the present study is novel in its own right. There is no other literature that contains the data mentioned in this study. In addition, the PYTHON gasification model was utilized to estimate the syngas potential of each of the 43 distinct crop residues. Most of the studies mentioned in Table 4, including the present study, have tried to estimate India’s residue potential nationwide by data fusion methodology, assessing the crop production data, their respective RPR, and SRF values. The gross residue amount of 869.11 MT estimated in this study is the highest compared to all the other studies. However, the surplus residue is estimated to be 288.14 MT, which is much below compared to that of the others. Unlike other studies, where rice has been mentioned as the highest residue-producing crop, this study estimates sugarcane as the highest residue-producing crop, followed by rice, banana, wheat, and mustard. Regarding India’s bioenergy potential, this study estimates an estimated annual total of 4.88 EJ bioenergy 3782 T.J. Deka, A.I. Osman, D.C. Baruah et al. Energy Reports 9 (2023) 3771–3786 Fig. 7.

Other pieces of literature have also re- ported the bioenergy potential of India from different agri-residue biomass. Ravindranath et al. (2005) found 4.715 EJ of available bioenergy in India from crop residues for ear 1996–97, with an increased projection of up to 6.565 EJ in 2010. According to Hiloidhari et al. (2014), an average of 4.15 EJ crop residue bioenergy per year was available in India from 2003 to 2008.
