 Unlike food grains, horticultural crops such as fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants are highly perishable and susceptible to rapid quality deterioration after harvest. Proper postharvest management is critical for minimizing losses, maintaining quality, ensuring food safety, and extending the shelf-life of these products. Globally, postharvest losses are a significant issue, often accounting for 35-40% of production in different commodities. Conventional postharvest management systems face several challenges that limit their effectiveness. Many traditional methods rely heavily on manual handling, subjective quality assessment, and rudimentary storage practices, which can lead to inconsistent quality control and significant postharvest losses. Additionally, traditional methods are labour-intensive and costly, limiting scalability, especially in regions with limited access to modern technology. Inadequate infrastructure, such as cold chain systems and packaging technologies, further exacerbates these losses, where access to advanced storage and transportation facilities may be limited. Other issues include the lack of real-time monitoring, inadequate pest and disease control, and the difficulty in predicting optimal harvesting times, which can lead to over-ripening or under-ripening of crops. With increasing global demand for food and rising pressures on natural resources, it is critical to adopt more efficient, sustainable, and scalable solutions. Digital technologies application in PHM Digitalization refers to the integration of digital technologies into horticultural practices, enabling stakeholders to collect and analyze data in real-time. The advent of digital technologies has now transformed how postharvest management is carried out, offering innovative tools to address many of the issues faced by conventional systems. Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and big data analytics offer real-time, precise monitoring of crop conditions during storage and transportation, enabling timely interventions to maintain product quality and minimize losses. The Internet of Things (IoT) connects various devices and sensors within agricultural Indian Horticulture 46 settings, allowing for the real-time monitoring of crops and environmental conditions. This continuous flow of information helps farmers make timely decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, ultimately leading to improved postharvest quality and reduced losses. The buzzwords, Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning (AI and ML) process vast amounts of data from various sources, identifying patterns and making predictions about crop yields, pest infestations, and disease outbreaks. For example, ML algorithms can analyze historical weather data and crop performance to predict optimal harvest times, enhancing postharvest management by ensuring that crops are harvested at their peak quality.
