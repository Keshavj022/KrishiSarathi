Gurbachan Singh Village – Burj Deva Singh Land holding – 36 acres CRM experience – 18 years Surface seeding: For 5 years • S. Gurbachan Singh is a known face from district Tarn Taran in the field of Agriculture, whose name was mentioned by Hon’ble Prime Minister of India in Mann ki Baat for crop residue management. • He is adopting surface seeding- cum-mulching technique of wheat for 5 years (https://fb.watch/q0Fgf_ NI6r/?mibextid=RtaFA8). • As per him, more fibrous roots are developed in surface seeded wheat that protects the plants from lodging (https://fb.watch/ q0EkpQ96KZ/?mibextid=RtaFA8). • Wheat sown by limesing surface seeding method was very less affected by the harsh weather conditions last year. • He said that surface seeding technology keep field weed free and ensure healthy crop stand. • The crop yield was registered at par with other crop residue management` approaches. • This innovative approach in paddy straw management and wheat sowing economizes input cost. As per my experience (S. Gurbachan Singh), in this technique, fertilizer is placed (by broadcasting) at proper distance from seed and that is the reason more fibrous roots are developed to capture the nutrients. Moreover, in surface seeding, seed is placed over the soil surface that’s why more fibrous roots are developed on and or near the soil surface, whereas in conventional methods or other crop residue management practices, the seed is placed at 4-6 cm deep in soil so fibrous roots are developed at same depth and supporting roots develop near surface. Fibrous roots development in wheat plant sown by surface seeding method Fibrous roots development in wheat plant sown by Happy Seeder method S. Jaskaran Singh Village – Burj Deva Singh Land holding – 35 acres CRM experience – 18 years Surface seeding: For 3 years • S. Jaskaran Singh is also practising surface seeding-cum-mulching in wheat crop from last 3 years. • He started with 3 acres about three years ago and expanded to 30 acres at present.
