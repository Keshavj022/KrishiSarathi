 For example, in drought-prone regions like Marathwada in Maharashtra, farmers have no choice but to wait for monsoon rains, as groundwater levels are severely depleted. Even when irrigation systems are available, the infrastructure is often poorly maintained, and farmers face challenges in accessing water during critical stages of crop growth. Moreover, more than half of the farmers in rainfed areas struggle with limited access to markets. In regions like Odisha and Madhya Pradesh, poor road connectivity and lack of cold storage facilities force farmers to sell their Bajra farmer Indian Farming 7 January 2025 produce at low prices. The lack of access to organized markets means that middlemen often exploit farmers, reducing their profits. Additionally, post-harvest losses are significant, with poor storage facilities resulting in up to 30% of crop production being wasted in some regions. To ensure the long-term viability of rainfed agriculture in India, greater investment is essential in rural infrastructure, farmer education, and implementation of climate-resilient technologies. With the appropriate support, India’s rainfed farming communities can enhance their resilience to climate change and improve their livelihoods, ensuring food security for millions. Socio-economic issues Socio-economic constraints in dryland farming stem from the poor economic conditions of the farmers. They face limited access to inputs, delayed availability of credit, and have a low risk-bearing capacity. As a result, dryland farmers adopt low-input agriculture, leading to poor yields. Opportunities in rainfed agriculture • Rainfed agriculture in India, despite its challenges, holds tremendous potential for sustainable development and improved livelihoods, especially for the millions of small and marginal farmers who depend on it. With over half of the country’s arable land being rainfed, innovative strategies can transform this sector into a more resilient and productive system. By adopting climate-resilient agriculture, leveraging technological advancements, and creating policy and market support, India’s rainfed farmers can better cope with the growing impacts of climate variability and enhance their economic prospects. • Climate resilient agriculture offers a range of practices that can help Indian rainfed farmers increase their resilience to climate-related challenges. One such practice is agroforestry, which involves integrating trees with crops providing multiple benefits such as fruits, fodder, timber, improving soil quality and ecosystem services. In states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, agroforestry has already shown success in improving land productivity while offering additional income from timber and fruit trees. Another effective practice is conservation agriculture, which involves minimizing soil disturbance, maintaining crop cover, and practicing crop rotation.
