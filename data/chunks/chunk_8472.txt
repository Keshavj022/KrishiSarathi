Two hundred and twelve released varieties and 32 parental lines were received and were added to the long-term conservation. In the cryobank, 733 accessions were cryopreserved as seeds, embryos, embryonic axes, making the total to 4,609 accessions. In-vitro cultures of 78 accessions in the in-vitro Genebank have resulted in 1,254 accessions in total. Accessions conserved in long-term storage are 66, 292 and in medium storage are 36, 834. 2. Salient Achievements Crop Improvement and Management PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES SUCCESS STORY KIWI IN HIMACHAL PRADESH Regional Station of the NBPGR at Shimla has been the pioneer in introduction, multiplication and early initiatives for commercial cultivation of Kiwi (Actinidia chinensis) in India, especially in Himachal Pradesh. It organizes “Kiwi Days” in February and March to impart training to farmers on various aspects of Kiwi cultivation. Till date, more than 10,000 rooted plants have been distributed all- over India, and about 500 farmers have adopted Kiwi for commercial cultivation. Kiwi fruit Actinidia chinensis in bearing at the NBPGR Regional Station, Shimla l Undertook twelve explorations to capture and rescue the existing plant genetic resources at the Sardar Sarovar Catchment area. l In the National Seed Genebank, the total has reached to 231,539 accessions. l Issued 31 phytosanitary certificates for the export material. l ARIS cell has computerized information on 4.5 lakh exotic and 2.5 lakh indigenous collections. l Submitted to Genbank, 2 Mb of rice chromosome 11 data after sequencing.
