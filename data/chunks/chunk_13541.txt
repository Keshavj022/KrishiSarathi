 Productivity during intercropping can be measured using the land equivalent ratio (LER), defined as the land area required to produce, from sole crops, the same yield as that achieved by intercropping [71]. Crop mixes include cereals, legumes, and oilseed crops at different ratios [72]. Lentils have been successfully intercropped. Lentil/wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) ratios of 2:1, 10:3, 10:2, and 10:1 had Agriculture 2024, 14, 103 9 of 15 LER values ranging from 1.21 (10:1 ratio) to 1.45 (10:3 ratio) [73], and lentil/mustard (Brassica juncea L.) ratios of 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 with different plant densities peaked at an LER value of 1.54 (4:1 ratio) [74]. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium available after crop harvest were also increased in lentil/mustard systems. Likewise, the water use efficiency was higher than that in lentil and mustard monocultures [75]. Linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) at lentil/linseed ratios of 6:1, 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 peaked at an LER value of 1.54 (4:1 ratio) [76]. Sugarcane (Saccharum hybrid cultivar) showed a higher equivalent yield in systems intercropped with lentils than in sugarcane alone [77]. The highest yields recorded in intercropping systems with lentils have been attributed to nitrogen fixation [72]. Based on the above, intercropping lentils with other species improves the production and yield of plants of agricultural and nutritional interest in addition to improving the soil. Therefore, this technique is an alternative to using chemical fertilizers. 7. Lentil Crop Constraints in a Changing Environment The lentil crop is subjected to several biotic and abiotic stresses that limit its production. Lentil seed yields of 3.3 and 2.8 t ha−1 have been obtained in research fields in New Zealand and Canada [78,79], but according to FOA data [7], the world average yield in 2021 was 1.10 t ha−1. Enormous yield gaps are observed between major producer countries, ranging from 2.54 t ha−1 in China to 0.60 t ha−1 in Iran (Table 1). Different factors explain these yield gaps. Lentil is employed as a rotation crop in the post-rainy season using residual soil moisture [80,81] and water disposition is key in yield improvement. For example, Oweis et al. [82] reported that supplementary irrigation increased lentil grain yield from 1.04 to 1.42 t ha−1 in a Mediterranean environment under rainfed conditions. In addition to drought, lentil faces other constraints that drive significant production losses, including high and low temperatures, soil factors, diseases such as wilt, root rot, and rust, insect pests, and parasitic weeds [80,81]. In climate change scenarios, drought and high temperatures are considered priority constraints to be addressed, especially in Mediterranean-type climates where lentil pro- duction is affected by heat waves and erratic rainfall [80]. In the context of climate change, Delahunty et al.
