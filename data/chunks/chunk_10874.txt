 Greengram and Blackgram   Sowing time is generally from June 15th fortnight- July 15th   Greengram varieties MGG-295, MGG-347, TM-96-2, WGG-37 and WGG-42; blackgram YMV resistant varieties PU-31, LBG-752, LBG-787, MBG-207 preferably in black soils.   Treat seeds with imidacloprid @5g or thiamethoxam @ 5g/kg   Intercropping can be done with cotton (2:1 or 1:1 ratio) or redgram (6:1) / (8:1)   Greengram can be taken as a preceding crop to Rice and Chilli as green manure for incorporation in the soil. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 155 Soybean   Sow varieties ASB-22 (Basara), JS-335, LSB-18, JS-93-05 during 15th June 15th July using seed drill / gorru / desi plough / by tractor drawn seed cum fertilizer drill / broad bed furrow planter.   Sowing of Soybean by Broad bed Furrow (BBF) planter or Raised bed method facilitates the crop to withstand heavy rains and moisture stress conditions and to obtain higher yields.   Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 1 g or thiram or captan @ 3 g/kg followed by Rhizobium culture @ 200 g 10 kg/seeds   Apply 50 kg DAP + 20 kg MOP at the time of sowing and top dressing of urea @ 25 -30 kg / acre should be followed at 30 DAS in Soybean   Pre-emergence herbicides like pendimethalin 30 % @ 1 – 1.5 lt/ acre should be applied within 24 -48 hours after sowing with the help of hand sprayer for better control of weeds in soybean.   Stem fly in soybean occurs in late sown situations, plants will wilt and dry completely. To control this spray chlorantraniliprole @ 0.3 ml/lt water.   Post emergence application of quizalofop ethyl @ 400 ml/ acre for control of grasses and imazethapyr + imazomax 40 g /acre or imazethapyr 10 % @ 250 ml to control the grasses and broad leaved weeds. Castor   Sow high yielding castor hybrids PCH-111, DCH-177, DCH-519 & ICH-66 from 15th June to 15th July in rainy season under rainfed.   Intercrop with redgram in 1:1 or greengram in 1:3 ratio, open furrows between rows to conserve moisture in light soils. Horticultural Crops Mango   Pruning to remove criss –cross branches may be done so that the center of the tree is opened out and inner branches are exposed to sunlight. Pruning of the dried twigs and branches should be done with a pruning saw during June-July. Pruning in mango encourages production of new shoots.   Fertilizers should be applied through placement in circular trenches around the trunk. For the 10 years age and above trees the recommended fertilizers should be applied at 1.5 m away from the trunk   Manures and fertilizers should be completed with the beginning of monsoon. Irrigation should be given after the application of fertilizers, if there is no sufficient rainfall. Wherever irrigation is available it is advantageous to apply half of the recommended dose of fertilizers after the fruit set.   For the correction of micronutrient deficiency, spraying of ZnSo4 5 g , Boran 2 g and 10 g urea per liter of water is recommended at the onset of monsoon.
