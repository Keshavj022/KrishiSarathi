The meeting began with a brief background on the issue by ADG (IPR). Two facts that emerged in the preliminary discussion were as follows: 1. R&D work related to release of indigenously developed Bt cotton hybrids/varieties and containing Cry1Ac gene obtained from the University of Ottawa, Canada is at a very advanced stage. It is expected that the ICAR- SAU system may be able to propose the release of these materials for cultivation by the farmers by the year 2008. The release of indigenously developed Bt cotton varieties is an issue of immense interest for the poor cotton farmers. Farmers cultivating these Bt cotton varieties shall not have to buy the expensive hybrid Bt cotton seed from the private seed companies every year. Even the cost of indigenously developed Bt cotton hybrids from the ICAR-SAU system is expected to be much less than the cost of similar seed from the private sector. 2.
