 Higher stover yields of 10–15 tonnes can be obtained from sorghum and pearl millet cultivars with good management practices. Other millets produce 3–8 tonnes of fodder depending on cultural conditions. These are mostly kharif (rainy)-grown crops, while rabi (winter) sorghum and summer pearl millet are also cultivated in several states. Finger millet stover is considered a good feed in India and Nepal. Under rainfed conditions, finger millet stover yield is about 2–3 t/ha and may reach up to 6–10 t/ha under irrigation. However, the stover obtained from the rainfed crop is relished more by cattle compared to an irrigated crop because stover of irrigated crop is tough and fibrous, and hence is less palatable. Finger millet stover can be used to feed crossbred dairy cows in diets supplemented with a concentrate mixture (energy and protein). Such diets allow 8 to 9 kg milk yield and a body weight gain of 200–300 g/day. It can be used for growing heifers when supplemented with wheat bran (25%) or groundnut cake. Dry matter intake of stover is about 3.5 kg/day and the daily weight gain is 310–350 g. It can also be made into silage with suitable supplements. Augmenting stover quality Stover should not be fed without supplementation because they do not provide enough energy and protein to meet animal’s requirements.
