 Gene editing by CRISPR/Cas in Nicobari indigenous chicken: Inhibin alpha gene was edited by CRISPR/Cas in Nicobari chicken. The efficiency of production of transgenic birds was 21.7 and 7.6% for exon1 and exon2, respectively, while efficiency of production of inhibin alpha edited birds was 13% for exon1 only. The egg production up to 72 weeks of age was significantly higher by 103.9% in edited birds as compared to the control birds (261 vs 128 eggs). Egg quality (Haugh unit and yolk colour index) was better and the serum levels of reproductive hormones were higher in the edited birds. Rapid detection kit for authentication of chicken: Immunochromatography-based chicken detection kit (ICDK) was developed for the authentication of chicken. The kit contains extraction buffer, pestle and mortar for extraction of target analytes, assay strips and the entire test can be performed in any resource-limited settings within 15 min. The developed kit is highly sensitive, species-specific and can be stored at ambient temperature for 2-3 months. Each test costs approximately ₹35.00. Duck In the S-1 g e n e r a t i o n of Kuzi (native duck) population, the egg production up to 72 weeks of age was 218±5 eggs and the egg weight was 71.29±0.30 g. In the next (S- 2) generation, there was an increase of 125 g in 8 weeks body weight. The shank length and keel length of cross KD (Khaki Campbell × Kuzi) recorded at 8 weeks of age were 69.28±0.51 and 129.5±1.01 mm, respectively. Corresponding shank length and keel length in DK (Kuzi × Khaki Campbell) were 71.80±0.43 and 125.8±0.82mm, respectively. The growing period body weights were higher in Kuzi compared to the crosses. The egg production up to 40 weeks of age in Kuzi, KD and DK crosses was 110.2, 123.4 and 130.6 eggs, respectively and the corresponding egg weights were 71.23±0.16, 68.61±0.45, 67.68±0.28 g. Besides, research efforts have been initiated for developing aflatoxin-tolerant duck population. Yak Genomic diversity in Arunachali yak population: Inbreeding poses a major challenge for yak conservation and genetic improvement. Genomic diversity was estimated in Arunachali yak population based on data generated using ddRAD sequencing. Three indices, viz. Livestock Improvement Adult ducks (DK cross) icar annual report 2022-23 69 nucleotide diversity (0.041 in 200 bp windows), effective population size (Ne = 83) and runs of homozygosity (>90% were short and medium length) revealed that the genomic diversity in Arunachali yak breed as of now is optimum. Selection signatures in Arunachali yak genome: Yak has been extensively exposed to natural selection as a part of its environmental adaptation in cold and hypoxic conditions. In order to identify the selection footprints or selection signatures in Arunachali yak genome, different test statistics were generated from genomic data.
