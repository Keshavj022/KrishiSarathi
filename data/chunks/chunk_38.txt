 • He is very much convinced with the performance of this technology and gets yield up to 22.0 q/acre. • He observed that this technique provides one quintal higher wheat grain yield per acre and saved irrigation as compared to the conventional sowing methods. • He explained the benefits like low cost, weed free field and better yields. • Besides, all paddy straw is managed in- situ without any expensive machines. S. Balraj Singh Kulla Village – Kulla, Patti Land holding – 38 acres • He also shared his experiences on surface seeding stating that by following surface seeding of wheat, it costs hardly `600-700 per acre for sowing operation, whereas conventional required `2500-3000 per acre for field preparation including straw management to sowing operation. • This is also cheaper than other crop residue management practices/ machinery such as Happy Seeder, Super Seeder, Mulcher, Incorporation, etc. CRM experience: 10 years Surface seeding: For 3 years • He experienced that surface seeding is not much successful on very heavier soils or soils with low permeability. However, it is highly successful on comparatively lighter soils. • Water management is an important factor in surface seeding of wheat. • He gets 22.0 quintal per acre wheat yield through surface seeding-cum- mulching technique of wheat. e As this technique provides complete mulching over the soil surface, crop is saved from terminal heat stress especially during high temperature. e This technique reduces dependence on costly herbicide inputs as it ensures weed free crop or very less incidence is reported.
