The wounds of the control group (G I) were washed with normal saline only, and in Gr II, were treated with the Table 2. Wound-healing score of FMD treated with harida and bahera (ITK) and conventional therapy (CT) at WBUAFS pasted of harida and baheda. The biopsy material was collected from both the groups at 4 day intervals. The samples were preserved in 10% neutral buffer formaline, and routine histological technique was adopted using H &E method. On day 4, the histological examination in both the groups revealed severe inflammation, marked by presence of severe lymphocytic infiltrations and of sero-fibrinous exudates. On day 8 the histological examination in the treated group showed some evidence of regenerating epidermis and thin layer of dermis along with randomly arranged fibroblast and neovascularizatin. But in the control group there was no evidence of regeneration of the epidermal layer. On day 12, the dermis foundation was completed and a thin layer of epidermis with a few epidermal pegs having tendency to move towards the centre was noted. But in the control group the dermal layer was still in the process of regeneration and there was no evidence of epidermis. On the basis of all the findings of the histo- pathological studies it was concluded that wound healing was accelerated by topical use of harida and baheda in the treated group. Results at OUAT showed that in animals treated with powder of harida and baheda mixed with water, the hoof lesions were cured within 10-11 days. All other parameters were found Table 3.

CONCLUSION The ITK consisting of use of paste prepared from seeds of harida and baheda was validated at Veterinary colleges BAU, WBUAFS and OUAT. The practice proved effective in management of foot lesions in FMD, albeit at lower efficacy than the conventional treatment. Histo-pathological findings showed that wound healing was accelerated by topical use of harida and baheda, which could be responsible for efficacy of ITK.
