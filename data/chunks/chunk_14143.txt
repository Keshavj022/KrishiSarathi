 Furthermore, it lacks a proper carbon registry and a monitoring, reporting, and veriﬁcation (MRV) system, hindering its ability to facilitate robust price discovery for carbon emissions and evolve into a full-ﬂedged cap and trade system like the EU ETS11. The Market Transformation for Energy Efﬁciency (MTEE) is a pivotal government policy aiming to revolutionise the landscape by promoting energy-efﬁcient solutions across sectors12. MTEE achieves this through awareness campaigns, Fig. 2 Policy focus on the energy sector Note: PAT - Perform, Achieve, and Trade; MTEE - Market Transformation for Energy Efﬁciency; EEFP - Energy Efﬁciency Financing Platform; FEEED - Framework for Energy Efﬁcient Eco- nomic Development; ECBC - Energy Conservation Building Code; RDSS - Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme; NGHM - National Green Hydrogen Mission; 175 GW RE – Achieving 175 GW of Renewable Energy capacity by 2022 under the National Solar Mission and National Wind Mission; PM KUSUM - Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan Source: Created by authors Fig. 1 GHG emission contribution by different sources of energy in India in 2019 Note: The numbers inside the Figure represent emissions in Million Tons of CO2 equivalent.

Transformative policies for a sustainable future 23 incentives like the Bachat Lamp Yojana (BLY) offering energy-efﬁcient Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) at tradi- tional bulb costs, efﬁciency standards, and research pro- grams like the Super-Efﬁcient Equipment Programme (SEEP)13. It reduces energy costs, raises awareness, and low- ers greenhouse gas emissions. The Energy Efﬁciency Financing Platform (EEFP)14 facili- tates funding for energy efﬁciency initiatives, connecting stakeholders like project developers, industries, households, ﬁnancial institutions, investors, and government bodies. It overcomes ﬁnancial obstacles by acting as an intermediary between ﬁnancial institutions and project developers (Rasouli- nezhad & Taghizadeh-Hesary, 2022). EEFP has the potential to positively impact environmental outcomes by providing ﬁnan- cial resources for energy efﬁciency and contributing to a greener energy mix (Muganyi, Yan, & Sun, 2021). Within the Framework for Energy Efﬁcient Economic Development (FEEED)15, the Bureau of Energy Efﬁciency (BEE) introduces the Partial Risk Guarantee Fund for Energy Efﬁciency (PRGFEE) and the Venture Capital Fund for Energy Efﬁciency (VCFEE).
