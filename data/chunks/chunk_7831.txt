 At present the university has 75 ongoing internally funded research projects and 112 externally funded projects including 35 All India Coordinated Research Projects (AICRPs) and 4 All India Network Research Projects (AINRPs). Farmer friendly technologies (86) and location specific recommendations (380) in the field of agriculture and allied disciplines were developed for adoption by the farmers and agripreneurs of NEH Region. The University is equipped with well-established laboratories, research and demonstration farms, 6 KVKs, 6 Multi-Technology Testing Centres and 6 Vocational Training Centres in different parts of North East India in an effort for popularization of modern innovative and sustainable agriculture and agro based allied activities in the region. The university signed MoU with ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Umiam, Meghalaya (including Regional Centres) for facilitating students teaching, training and research under UG, PG and PhD Programme. The University also signed MOU’s with Western Sydney University, Australia; The Sustainable Environment Resource Institute (INNOVIR), New Delhi; Green Biotech Eco solutions, Manipur and Indian Institute of Governance and Leadership (IIGL), New Delhi for strengthening the academic, research and extension activities of the university. MOU with ICAR- Central Institute of Fisheries Education (CIFE), Mumbai was also renewed during the year. Rani Lakshmi Bai Central Agricultural University, Jhansi The Rani Lakshmi Bai Central Agricultural University, Jhansi made sustained growth in the field of education, research and extension to achieve the mandated objectives of its establishment as an institution of national importance. The University added two experiential learning resources one for Seed Production, Processing and Marketing, and another for Production of Quality Transplant and Processing of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants as a component of Student READY programme. The research work primarily focused on technology- driven production enhancement in pulses and oilseeds, particularly under moisture stress. High-yielding chickpea entries, each in Kabuli (RLBGK-1, RLBGK- 2) and Desi (RLBG-1, RLBG-2) types submitted in IVT trials during 2017–18 were promoted in AVT-1 trial for 2018–19. Inoculation with Trichoderma harzianum + propineb was effective against Sclerotium rot in chickpea. The ICAR-AICRP-Rapeseed Mustard centre was started in 2018–19 to promote cultivation of this important oilseed crop in the Bundelkhand region. Indian mustard entries, MCN-TS-18-27, 18–9, and 18-18 gave seed yield of 2.32-2.45 t/ha under timely-sown irrigated conditions. The SBG entries 18–10, 18–13, 18-28, and 18-29 were tolerant to white rust, while UDN entries 18–13, 18–32, 18–33, 18–35, 18–36, 18–46 were tolerant to Alternaria blight. Of the 96 lines, 22 SBG entries and 35 UDN PARTNERSHIP AND LINKAGES DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 149 entries showed tolerance to downy mildew under natural field conditions.
