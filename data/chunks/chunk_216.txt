Treated seeds are diligently dibbled into the soil, followed by a daily watering routine to nurture the growing seedlings. The process includes regular weeding and aftercare to foster healthy growth. After 30 days, the well-nurtured seedlings are ready for transplantation, marking a critical step in the journey from preparation to the cultivation of robust plants. Transplanting of redgram seedlings in the field To cultivate a successful crop, the first step involves land preparation, achieved through a series of essential practices such as ploughing, harrowing, and refining the soil to a fine tilth. Following the onset of the monsoon, furrows are opened at a precise distance of 6 feet apart, creating an optimal environment for the upcoming seedling transplant. Seedlings are then transplanted at a distance of 3 feet, utilizing spot application of FYM (Farmyard manure) or vermicompost. The cultivation process continues with timely weeding and nipping at 30 days after transplanting (DAT). To enhance the crop’s nutritional intake, chemical fertilizer is applied using the ring method at a rate of 2.5 bags of DAP (diammonium phosphate) per ha, accompanied by 20 kg of ZnSO, per ha. Concurrently, proactive plant protection measures are implemented, ensuring the health and vigour of the crop. Irrigation plays a critical role in the cultivation cycle, with crucial stages including flower initiation and pod filling requiring timely watering. Moreover, to mitigate transplanting shock, irrigation is compulsory on the day of transplanting, contributing to the overall success of the cultivation process. Advantages of redgram transplanting technology Redgram transplanting technology presents a paradigm shift in agricultural practices, offering a Indian Farming effectiveness. e The ease with which plant protection measures can be implemented adds to its appeal, making it a practical choice for farmers. e Moreover, the technology promotes increased branching, promising a 2-3 fold rise in yield levels, thereby enhancing overall productivity. e In essence, redgram transplanting technology emerges as a tailor-made solution, aligning with the specific needs of small and marginal farmers, ultimately fostering sustainable and _ efficient agricultural practices. Efforts of ICAR-KVK, Bidar for dissemination of redgram transplanting technology The Krishi Vigyan Kendra Bidar has implemented a multifaceted approach to disseminate redgram transplanting technology, encompassing various channels and initiatives.
