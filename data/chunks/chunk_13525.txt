 The main challenges related to energy production from crop residue biomass are feedstock availability, supply chain manage- ment, techno-economic and techno-environmental challenges. The efficacy of the whole process described in this estimation study can only be guaranteed after looking into all the different challenge aspects. To promote and execute crop residue-based bioenergy production facilities in India, more study using various recent and regional agricultural data is necessary. Experimenta- tion, validation, heat and mass transfer analyses in relation to the conversion of each agricultural residue to syngas production and subsequently MeOH generation are other investigations related to this topic. Additionally, research on the life cycle analysis of crop residue-based syngas and methanol synthesis and deployment in rural India will help towards sustainable energy generation from 3783 T.J.
