 Swarna Vaidehi: This variety has been developed by ICAR-RCER, Patna, and released by State Varietal Release Committee during 2013 for Bihar, Assam, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. It thrives in stagnant perennial water bodies, including ponds, land depressions, oxbow lakes, swamps, and ditches. It exhibits a remarkable production potential of 28-30 q/ha having 42-48% makhana pop recovery rate. It is commercially cultivated in North Bihar, Manipur, parts of West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh. At present, these varieties are under cultivation in large areas by progressive farmers and cooperative groups located in Darbhanga, Purnea, Madhubani, Katihar, and Sitamarhi) of Bihar and gaining valuable experience in its cultivation.

The upper surface of leaves is green and lower side is purple with 0.90 to 1.5 m long petiole. It is normally grown in tropical and subtropical climates in stagnant water of 0.2-2 m depth. It requires temperature in the range of 20 to 35oC; relative humidity of 50- 90% and annual rainfall of 100-250 cm for proper growth and development with water transparency of 50%. in north Bihar. The demand for makhana across the country creates opportunities for local wholesalers and other agents to benefit by transporting it to distant markets. The makhanaâ€™s price in these remote markets is generally 60-70% higher than the local market, making transportation a significant value-addition to the product. Due to its bulkiness, makhana requires more space compared to grains, even for smaller quantities. In the local market, makhana is normally sold at rates ranging from 350-500 per kg depending upon grading size, but once it reaches metropolitan markets, its price significantly jumps to 700 per kg or more, reflecting the increased demand and the importance of transportation in connecting supply with demand across regions. Health and nutritional value Makhana pop has enormous health benefits and most common dry fruits which has low or negligible fat content, but rich in protein, carbohydrates and minerals. It is used for milk-based food preparations like kheer, puddings and pulses-based curry, snacks.
