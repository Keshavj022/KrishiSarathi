 Mature males and females of 2+ year age are well distinguished, with females having bulged abdomen and males ooze free flowing white-milt with slight pressure.  Fully mature females are given injection of Ovaprim/Ovatide/Wova-FH @ 1.5 ml/kg body weight. No hormonal injection is given to males.  Spawning is undertaken by dry method of stripping after 12-13 h of injection. Freely releasing eggs of female are mixed with milt suspension prepared from extracted testes and macerating with normal saline solution, and fertilized. Generally female lays 15,000-18,000 eggs per 100 g body weight.  After 3-4 washings with clean freshwater, free floating eggs are transferred to the hatchery, where hatching occurs in 22-23 h.  Yolk-sac is absorbed in three days and larvae start accepting live feed, which is followed with adding inert compound feed (30% protein) at the age of 12-15 days. At rearing density of 500-1000/m2, survival levels of 70-80% are obtained during 3-4 weeks of indoor rearing.  The breeding and seed production technology has been mainly adopted in the state of Kerala.

In Southern India, however, they are found round the year.  Sexes are separate but require careful examination for assessing maturity in both the sexes. On maturity, female exhibit slightly bulged abdomen, round-reddish vent, whereas males exhibit pale vent, small and slender anal papilla but do not ooze milt on pressing the belly.  Female and male brooders (0.4-1.0 kg) are injected either with HCG @ 2000 and 1500 IU/ kg body weight or carp pituitary gland extract (PGE) @ 20-30 and 10-20 mg/kg body weight or Ovatide/Ovaprim @ 0.6 and 0.4 ml/kg body weight, respectively.  Spawning occur in 16-18 h at 26-28°C. Eggs are spherical, transparent, non-adhesive, free floating and straw yellow in colour. Generally, 10,000-15,000 eggs/kg female body weight is obtained at a time with 70-95% fertilization. The fish can spawn 3-4 times in a year.  Hatching occurs within 22-24 h with 70-95% success and yolk-sac is absorbed in 72 h. The spawn are reared for 7-10 days in small tanks and fed ad libitum with either zooplankton or Artemia nauplii. With good management measures, 50-60% survival is obtained.  Fry rearing in undertaken in outdoor tanks, fed with aquatic insects, tubifids and chopped earthworms mixed with powdered fish meal and soya flour (3:1) @ 5-10% of their body weight.
