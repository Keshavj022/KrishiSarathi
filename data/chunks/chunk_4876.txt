 Cloud computing provides a centralized platform for storing and analyzing vast datasets related to postharvest management. Big data analytics enables stakeholders to identify trends, monitor performance, and optimize processes. Blockchain enhances transparency and traceability in horticultural supply chains. By creating a secure, decentralized ledger of transactions, blockchain allows all stakeholders—producers, distributors, retailers, and consumers—to track the journey of crops from farm to table. This is particularly beneficial in postharvest management, as it ensures the integrity of product quality and safety, enabling stakeholders to verify the origin and handling of horticultural crops throughout the supply chain. Automation plays a significant role in the postharvest phase, especially in packing and sorting. Robotic systems can handle delicate fruits and vegetables with precision, ensuring minimal damage during the packing process. Automated sorting systems equipped with AI can analyze colour, size, and quality, categorizing products for optimal market distribution. This reduces human error and enhances the efficiency of postharvest operations. Drones are increasingly utilized in postharvest management for tasks such as monitoring storage facilities and assessing the health of crops before they are harvested. They can provide high-resolution imagery and data on crop conditions, allowing for better planning of postharvest processes. Additionally, drones can be used for targeted applications of protective treatments during the postharvest phase, ensuring that crops remain disease- free during storage and transport. Smart sensors-based solutions for postharvest supply chain management Quality and grading of fruits and vegetables: Traditional methods of quality assessment often rely on human inspectors, which can be time-consuming and subjective. Quality and grading assessments of fruits and vegetables are increasingly relying on AI-driven techniques to ensure consistency and accuracy. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are particularly effective for image recognition tasks, enabling the automated grading of produce based on visual attributes such as size, colour, and surface defects. For instance, a CNN can be trained on a labeled dataset containing images of high-quality and low-quality fruits. This automation not only enhances the efficiency of grading processes but also reduces human error, ensuring that only the highest-quality products reach consumers. Further, techniques such as image processing combined with ML algorithms can identify physical defects such as bruises, blemishes, or inconsistencies in shape and size. However, using algorithms like support vector machines (SVMs) or decision trees, ML systems can analyze image data to detect anomalies with a high degree of accuracy.
