 The minor edible oilseeds (Sesame, Sunflower, Safflower and Niger) contribute about 5% of the total domestic production of 7.03 Mt. Around 3.50 Mt of edible oils come from secondary sources (cotton seed oil, palm oil, corn oil, rice bran oil, coconut oil, and other TBOs). During the 70 years from 1950-51 to 2020-21, oilseeds production increased by seven Indian Agriculture after Independence 96 folds from 5.16 to 36.10 Mt. The average national productivity of nine annual oilseeds has increased from 0.43 t ha-1 in 1967 to 1.25 t ha-1 in 2020, mainly due to development and deployment of high-yielding varieties/hybrids and crop management technologies. Presently, India produces nearly 40% domestically and imports 60% of its total demand for edible oils. The per capita consumption of edible oils has grown from 15.8 kg yr-1 in 2012-13 to 18.8 kg yr-1 in 2019-20 with a CAGR of 2.17%. The demand and supply gap has widened over the years. The demand for edible oil was 25.63 Mt in 2019-20 against the total domestic production of 10.53 million tons which necessitated an import of around 15.1 Mt (palm oil about 60%; soybean oil 25%; sunflower 12% and others 3%) costing around Rs. 69000 crores to the national exchequer. The establishment of the All India Coordinated Research Project on Oilseeds (AICRPO) during 1967 helped accelerating research on oil seed crops. The project initially confined only to groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, linseed, sesame, and castor. In 1972, sunflower, safflower, and niger were added to the AICRP-Oilseeds. Research on soybean was initiated separately during 1967. AICRP-Oilseeds was stationed at IARI, New Delhi initially. With the establishment of the Directorate of Oilseeds Research (DOR) at Hyderabad in 1977, the responsibility to coordinate and monitor these programmes shifted to directorate and respective Project Coordinators. The AICRP on groundnut and AICRP on rapeseed- mustard were shifted to NRCG, Junagadh and NRCRM, Bharatpur during 1979 and 1993, respectively. The AICRP on soybean continued under NRCS, Indore established in 1987. The Project Coordinating Units of sunflower, safflower, sesame & niger, and linseed were located at UAS, Bangalore; MPAU, Sholapur; JNKVV, Jabalpur, and CSAUA&T, Kanpur respectively. Following the recommendations of the Jain Committee constituted by ICAR, the positions of Project Coordinator for groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, soybean, sunflower, castor, and safflower were withdrawn during IX Plan and the responsibility of coordination was entrusted to the concerned Project Director and Directors of NRCs, concerned. Presently, ICAR is implementing five AICRPs on nine annual oilseeds.
