 ● The fruit-based carbonated drinks are being tested at IARI, New Delhi NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 69 SOIL RESOURCE INVENTORY Soil Mapping Soil map of India has been generated on 1 : 1 m scale using soil polygon data from 1 : 250,000 scale soil maps with necessary categoric and cartographic generalization. The soils in this map belong to 7 orders and 62 great groups. There are 1649 soil units in this map. Similarly, regional level soil information system on 1 : 1 million scale has been developed for the north-eastern region of the country from the 1 : 250,000 scale through cartographic generalization. Several thematic maps useful in spatial analysis of relevant theme and land use planning have also been generated. District Soil Resource Atlases The district soil resource atlases covering at least one district in each state as a model, encompassing 30 to 40 different themes of significant importance in the district were generated. Maps pertaining to Aurangabad, Nagpur, Jalna and Ratnagiri (Maharashtra), Jamnagar (Gujarat), Madhubani (Bihar), Bankura and Puruliya (West Bengal), Ganjam (Orissa) and Rajgarh (Madhya Pradesh) have been completed. Five hundred copies of each such atlases have already been sent to district authorities for use by them for planning development work, education, extension, research and other activities. Mapping of Sirsa district of Haryana, Etawah district of Uttar Pradesh, Medak district of Andhra Pradesh and Bardhaman, Hugli and South 24-Parganas districts of West Bengal has also been completed. Soil Erosion Map Soil erosion map of Maharashtra state has been prepared. The erosion classes and the ranges of soil loss (tonnes/ha) along with the area affected in percentage of total have been worked out. Natural Resource Management Soil erosion classes, ranges and percentage area affected for Maharashtra Class Range of soil loss Area (tonnes/ha/annum) (per cent of the state) Very slight (<5.0) 46 Slight (5.0-10.0) 20 Moderate (10.0-15.0) 10 Moderately severe (15.0-20.0) 06 Severe (20.0-40.0) 08 Very severe (40.0-80.0) 05 Extremely severe (>80.0) 05 Extent of Sulphur Deficiency in Indian Soils and Response of Crops Extensive surveys revealed that sulphur (S) deficiency in Indian soils ranges from 5-83% with a mean of 41%. Of the 220 districts surveyed about 132 have more than 30% of S deficiency.
