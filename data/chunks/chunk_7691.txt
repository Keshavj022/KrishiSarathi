 In Sahiwal, the average first lactation 305-day milk yield, peak yield and lactation length were 1,651.62, 10.78 and 258.63 days, respectively. The first set of eight Sahiwal bulls were evaluated based on the first lactation 305-days milk yield of their daughters and the overall expected breeding value was 1,957.76± 51.14 kg with a range of 1,940.92 (–16.84 kg) to 1,989.75 kg (+31.98 kg). Large scale progeny testing: The project envisages to progeny test Frieswal (HF×Sahiwal) bulls under field conditions at four different agro-climatic locations in India having larger concentration of HF crossbred cows. During the year, 5,376, 5,450, 5,799 and 5,074 inseminations were carried out in GADVASU, Ludhiana; KVASU, Thrissur; BAIF, Uruli-Kanchan; and GBPUAT, Pantnagar, with the conception percentages of 47.0, 45.8, 42.5 and 56.9, respectively, in the adopted field areas. The number of daughters which completed their first lactation during the reporting period in the areas covered at Ludhiana, Thrissur, Uruli-Kanchan and Pantnagar were 433, 139, 152 and 221, respectively. In all the four centres, the first lactation milk production showed an increasing trend of 42.2, 60.1, 6.1 and 31.1% over the years; while the age at first calving recorded a decrease of 25.7, 13.1, 11.5 and 10.9%, respectively. Buffalo Progeny testing in Murrah breed is carried out at six participating institutional/ SVU centres, viz. CIRB, Hisar; NDRI, Karnal; IVRI, Izatnagar; GADVASU, Ludhiana; LUVAS, Hisar; and ICAR Research Complex for Eastern Region, Patna. About 14,000 artificial inseminations were carried out in the reported period at farmers’ doorstep in the village to produce daughters. The milk yields of daughters are being recorded for use in sire evaluation. Breedable buffaloes (1,067) are being maintained at institutional Murrah centres for production of high genetic merit male and female calves to be used for production of future sires. As per technical program for Murrah breed, a set of up to 15 pedigreed bulls is selected and it is used for AI in the associated herds and field buffaloes (approximately 14,000 AIs per annum) for test mating over 18 months duration. The XVII set has 16 superior bulls (10 bulls from CIRB, Hisar; 4 bulls from GADVASU, Ludhiana and 2 bulls from NDRI, Karnal). So far, 234 superior bulls have been test mated in 17 sets and 15 bulls of XVIII set are under test mating. Data of 581 daughters (born from the 13th set of bulls), which completed first lactation were compiled and bulls were evaluated. Bull no. 2234 and 2269 from GADVASU, Ludhiana ranked first and second with sire index value of 2,688 kg and 2,619 kg, respectively. The per cent superiority over their contemporary daughters was 14.80 and 13.86%, respectively. Elite herds of Jaffarabadi, Surti, Bhadawari and Nili Ravi breeds of buffaloes were established in their respective breeding tracts. Semen freezing laboratories were also established at all the centres.
