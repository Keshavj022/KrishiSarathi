Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): Eleven improved varieties have been released at national / regional level in different under utilized crops during the last five years by central variety release committee based on their performance at multi locations in various coordinated trials.

Supplementation with FYM @ 5 t/ha further enhances the seed yield. Substitution of 25% N by FYM or Neem cake also enhances grain yield. • In hills intercropping french bean and amaranth in 2:1 row ratio results in highest grain yield and gross income. • In Tamil Nadu grain amaranth can profitably be intercropped by growing its one row in widely spaced (90 cm) pigeonpea. It gives B:C ratio of 1.89. As a pure crop also it gives higher yield than black gram. In this context TNAU and a private company has signed MOU for cultivation of amaranth at farmers fields. Buckwheat: • Pre‐emergent application of alachlor @ 1.5 kg/ ha is effective to control weeds both in common and tatary buckwheats.
