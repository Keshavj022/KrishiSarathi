This application provides a user-friendly, bilingual (Hindi and English) e-platform to have necessary and crisp information on important agro-forestry tree species to the farmers. It covers various aspects like general descriptions, potential areas, silvicultural requirements, nursery techniques, planting techniques, tending operations, suitable agroforestry systems, tree protection, yield, utilization and material availability of each tree species along with few success stories. CROP MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 76 fodder, mineral mixture supplementation, de-worming, artificial insemination, small-scale processing and capacity building. Crop Protection Emerging insect pest tea mosquito bug in cotton: During last two years incidence of tea mosquito bug was observed in cotton crop and it causes heavy damage to cotton crop. Taking into consideration the importance of this pest, damage potential was assessed. The molecular identification confirms the species as Helopeltis theivora. Severely damaged shoots die back due to the effect of bug saliva and causes a bunched terminal growth known as ‘witches broom’. The boll infested by this pest develops characteristic black wart eruptions. A single 1st instar, 2nd instar, 3rd instar, 4th instar, 5th instar nymph and female and male adult of H. theivora could make as many as 63, 80, 71, 59, 51, 96 and 56 feeding punctures in 24 h, respectively.
