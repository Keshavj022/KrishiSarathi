 It may be available in many other states but no such record was found. Traditional methods of preparation of sorghum Indian Farming 73 (01): 94-95; January 2023 pops are elaborate which poses to be a reason for its less usage. Sorghum grain is soaked, shade dried and popped in big pans. During the soaking procedure, the grain moisture is brought to 14–16%, and it is exposed to sudden dry heat in a pan. The pan is covered with a mesh dome to avoid spilling of popped grains. In this study, a simple procedure was developed for popping sorghum with the help of a small popcorn maker, costing around `2000–3000. It can be used for roasting of other items. In this machine, a handful of grains can be popped in 2–3 min, unlike the conventional popping machines that require large quantities of grains. This procedure takes short time and a small quantity can be popped. Sorghum seed harvested during the winter season (rabi) or post-rainy season can be readily used for popping till 5–6 months due to inherent moisture. Later, they can be washed, kept in refrigerator for 1 hr and then popped. Use of pop maker for making popped sorghums is easy and can be done in a short duration. Types Central India, especially Karnataka, has diverse types of pop sorghums. Sorghum varieties for popping have been identified in the series as Pop 1–Pop 120. Among them, germplasm lines, viz. POP 16 (IC 308651), POP 31 (IC 308660), POP 32 (IC 308661), POP 37 (IC 308664), POP 38 (IC 308665), POP 47 (IC 308671), POP Indian Farming 95 January 2023 49 (IC 308673), POP 50 (IC 308674), POP 54 (IC 308678), POP 58 (IC 308682), POP 59 (IC 308683), POP 60 (IC 308684), and POP 62 (IC 308685) were identified with more than 70% popping ability in studies conducted a decade ago. Later, there were special releases like Phule Panchami (RPOSV-3) from Rahuri (MPKV University) for popping. In our recent study, it was found that guinea race germplasm lines are suitable for semolina and popping. Other breeding like C43 and Pop 11 were found to be very good for popping. A dedicated program to combine popping and high yield resulted in identifying 5–6 lines that have more than 80% popping percentage and 70–100% popping expansion volume. Need There is a need to develop end-use specific lines to promote linkages of farmers and food industry. Under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the All India Coordinated Research Projects (AICRP) are conducted for multi-location testing of varieties and hybrids. Under AICRP on sorghum, a coordinated multi-location trial for popping was being arranged to encourage breeding and production of sorghum lines having high popping volume (the size of the grain after popping should be large) and popping percentage (the percentage of grains popped should be more). In order to increase the popping trait, concerted efforts in breeding are active. Considerable genetic variability was found for popping efficiency (both in terms of popping percentage and pop volume).
