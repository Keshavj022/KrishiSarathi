The hoof wounds if treated at the start of disease could be cured at the earliest. However, if the wound was infested with maggots and treated late, the cure was delayed. The complicated hoof wounds took much time and were cured in 2 months, and in some cases the hoof was deformed due to muscular growth. In this experiment the cases were treated just after the report by the farmers and no complication was observed. CONCLUSION It was concluded that bantulsi leaf paste is slightly effective in treatment of hoof wound of FMD in cattle PRA and field study Data on PRA and field study are presented in Table 1 Table 1.

However, extent of cure was reported more in the allopathic treatment. On other parameters both the treatments were found to be at par. Experiment Data on the cure of hoof wound after treatment with paste of bantulsi and allopathic treatment are given in Table 2. The bantulsi paste could cure only 20% animals suffering from hoof wound of FMD, whereas the allopathic treatment could cure  VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Code : 1588 Title of the ITK : Control of FMD in cattle with camphor Description of the ITK : Mouth wounds and hoove wounds are common disease in cattle/animals. Farmers of Bagraisai village of Saraikela Kharsawan district in Jharkhand use following practice for treatment of hooves and mouth wounds. 1.For hooves: Cattle are made to walk in sandy soils along the river bed. The coarse sand helps to clean the wound by friction. Hooves are washed with hot water; then 2 pieces of camphor and 10 ml coconut oil mixed together are applied on the wounds, which acts as an antiseptic. 2. For mouth: Paste of roasted brinjal and pure ghee is scrubbed on the tongue to clean as well as treat the lesions. The cost of above two treatments is very less, i.e. almost Rs 3 to Rs 5 per animal, which is successful in more than 95% of cases. All the farmers in the village use these age-old practices.
