 Nutritive components of banana peels (Musa sapientum) [39,48–50]. Nutritional Component Content (%) Carbohydrates 59–67 Proteins 0.9–5.3 Starch 3.5–6.3 Fibre 19.2–31.7 Crude fat/lipids 1.24–5.93 Ash 3.95–9.60 Banana peels can be used to remove cyanide from contaminated wastewater [51]. They are utilized as a feedstock for biofuel production [52] and ethanol production [53]. The peels’ Agriculture 2024, 14, 1894 4 of 24 adsorption properties enable their application in steel corrosion inhibition [54]. The peels are rich in phenolic compounds, which have multiple health benefits, such as prohibiting cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes, when incorporated into food. Their antifungal properties enable treatment against various fungi [44,55–57]. They are directly used as feed for animals such as livestock, monkeys, fish, poultry, and pigs because of their high fiber content [58,59]. Recently, the cover or shell of the banana fruit has received considerable recognition in farming as a green or organic fertilizer due to its high potassium content and minute amounts of other nutrients required by the soil, as seen in Table 2. Table 2. Elemental composition of BPs [60]. Element Content (mg/100 g) Potassium 475.6 Calcium 323.0 Sodium 148.9 Phosphorous 122.5 Iron 0.40 Manganese 69.0 Zinc 4.55 The benefits of using BPs as a fertilizer include reducing the costs associated with transportation and dumping the peels, conserving soil biodiversity, improving plant yield, and preserving the environment and protecting it against adverse effects caused by chemical fertilizers. It also reduces the bad odour resulting from the peels decomposing, expanding and adding more value to the banana industry. Additionally, it contributes to sustainable and organic farming. The avenues taken to prepare banana peel-based fertilizers are discussed in the next section. 3.1. Banana Peel-Based Fertilizers The high potassium (K) content in this under-utilized renewable resource has made it an attractive fertilizer to agricultural scientists. Various recipes and methods exist to utilize BP or extract its high potassium content (Figure 2). BPs can be converted to ash by combusting the peels in open flames (Figure 2a). Alternatively, the peels can be pyrolyzed at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere to convert them to biochar (Figure 2b). Figure 2. Various banana peel-based fertilizer preparation methods, including (a) ashes, (b) biochar, (c) composite peels, (d) powder, (e) extract, and (f) filtrate. Agriculture 2024, 14, 1894 5 of 24 Banana peels can be dried along with other agro-waste materials such as orange peels, eggshells, tangerine peels, moringa leaves, cow dung, and synthetic fertilizers and mixed to form a composite fertilizer (Figure 2c). In this way, a superior organic fertilizer with synergistic capabilities is formed. The dried peels can be crushed and utilized as a standalone fertilizer (Figure 2d).
