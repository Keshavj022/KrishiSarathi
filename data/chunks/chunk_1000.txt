Origin: • Wild African grasses in the Nile valley and the Sahel zone. • Subsequently taken to China, India, Americas and Europe 1. Millets are highly climate resilient crops • Climate change is affecting the crop yield and quality of many crops. • But millets possess several morpho, physiological & biological characters- thus are adaptable to dry regions. • Early maturity (65-85 days); high drought (150- 500 mm rainfall) and salinity tolerance; high heat tolerance (>42o C of air temperature) • Adapted to adverse, marginal & changing environments • Supports increased resilience to climate change WHY HOW Why International Year of Millets? 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 300 600 400 500 350 350 450 1250 2100 • MILLETS: Africa (Western, Eastern, Northern Africa) and Asia (Southern & Eastern Asia) leads in production (95%) in arid and semiarid agro-ecosystem • SORGHUM: Africa (Western, Eastern, Northern Africa), Americas (North, Central and South) and Asia (Southern & Eastern Asia) leads in production (95%) in arid and semiarid, tropical subtropical and temperate agro-ecosystem ( ) • Grows with minimal fertilizers and pesticides • Survive with less water • Grows faster putting less stress on the environment. Why International Year of Millets? 3. Millets are: Good for the planet (Take less to give more) • Millets provide a viable option for the marginal farmers & Sustainable production system • Multiple uses as food, feed/ fodder, biofuels, brewing • Eaten in many forms 4.
