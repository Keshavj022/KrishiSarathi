 Economic scope and opportunities • Diversification of livelihoods: NE India, with over 87% of farmers categorized as marginal and small, relies predominantly on traditional farming for Community cage culture in the Umiam lake, Meghalaya Community cage culture in Dumbur reservoir, Tripura Indian Farming 40 December 2023 sustenance. CBCC offers the opportunity to create additional income sources, reducing dependence on a single sector and bolstering economic resilience. • Employment generation: The establishment and operation of cage culture systems require a skilled workforce. From cage construction to daily maintenance and market linkage, CBCC can generate employment opportunities across various skill levels, benefiting both skilled and unskilled labour. • Enhanced fresh fish production: Given the escalating demand for fresh fish, CBCC holds the potential to significantly contribute to meeting this demand. Opportunities for ‘live fish‘ marketing emerge. Controlled conditions often lead to improved growth rates and yields in cages compared to land-based farming, potentially escalating fish production in the region. • Value addition: Cage culture enables high-density rearing of valuable species such as Pengba (Osteobrama belengeri) in Manipur, Pabda (Ompok bimaculatus) in Tripura, and Chital (Chitala chitala) in Assam. This promotes value addition in the fisheries sector, translating to increased income and enhanced profitability for aquaculture entrepreneurs. • Market access: Well-managed CBCC systems ensure consistent and high-quality fish supply, catering to local markets effectively. Moreover, surplus production can be channeled to distant markets, further amplifying income opportunities for the region. Social scope and opportunities • Social security: Poaching and poisoning stand out as the primary challenges in fish culture within NE India. However, these issues can potentially be addressed through community participation and collaboration. • Women empowerment: In numerous communities across Northeast India, women hold a crucial role in fish- related activities. CBCC has the potential to empower women by engaging them in various aspects of the process, such as feeding, maintenance, and marketing. This active involvement can contribute significantly to their economic and social empowerment. It has been observed that aquaculture proves more successful when women are actively engaged. • Skill development: The practice of cage culture requires specialized knowledge in fish husbandry, water quality management, and cage maintenance. Implementing training programs can build local capacity and enhance the skill sets of individuals, improving employability. • Rural-urban linkages: The fish produced through cage culture can bridge the rural-urban divide by supplying urban markets with fresh produce. This linkage can foster economic ties and create opportunities for urban investment in rural aquaculture.
