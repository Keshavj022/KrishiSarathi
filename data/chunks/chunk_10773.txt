   In the areas where White Grub is a major problem seed should be treated with 3 ml Imidachloprid 17.8 % SL/ kg seed kernel before sowing.   To control Collar Rot & Root Rot use 4 kg Trichoderma harzianum mixed with 50-60 kg well decomposed FYM, kept in shady place with optimum moisture level for its multiplication and mix in soil in 1 ha area at the time of sowing.   For seed treatment 10 g Trichoderma or 2 g Carbendazim 50 WP or 1.5 g Tebuconazole 2 DS/ kg seed kernel may be used before sowing. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 34 Paddy: Nursery raising: Paddy is also cultivated in some parts of the state in kharif season, for its nursery raising land should be prepared properly. Prepare 1.0-1.5 m wide nursery beds. Generally, 400-500 m2 nursery area is sufficient for transplanting in one ha area. Paddy nursery can be raised in second fortnight of May and 24-25 kg seed is sufficient for transplanting in one ha area. In nursery paddy seed should be covered properly with sand or with mixture of sand and manure, nurser bed should be always moist without standing water. Suitable Varieties: Important varieties are PR-106, PR-1121, BK-190, PB-1, Pusa Sugandha-1, Sugandha-4, Improved Pusa Basmati-1, Basmati-1059 etc. Ashok-20 & Bagad Dhan can be directly seeded in the field & it should be completed in the last fortnight of June, as per irrigation water availability. Pearl millet (Bajra): Sowing: A major kharif season dual purpose crop cultivated for grain as well as for fodder purpose. Its sowing is started with the onset of monsoon and is a highly drought tolerant crop. Improved Varieties: There are two type varieties in Bajra crop (Composite & Hybrid) with a large variation in maturity period (from 60 days to 100 days maturity period). Selection of variety should be done very carefully, for example under early onset of monsoon, long duration composite varieties should be cultivated and under late onset of monsoon extra short duration varieties should be grown. Important varieties are as follows: Composites: Raj-171, CZP-9802, MBC-2 (Maturity Period- 90 to 100 days) Hybrids: HHB-67, HHB-67 improved, RHB-121, RHB-173, RHB-154, RHB-177, MPMH-117 (Maturity Period- 65 to 75 days) Bio-fortified Hybrids- HHB-299 & AHB-1200, RHB-233 & RHB-234 (Rich in Fe & Zn) Seed Rate: Pearl millet require 4-5 kg of seed per ha for getting optimum plant population Plant protection: Termite & White grub are serious pest in Bajra crop, therefore, apply Fipronil 0.3G@ 12 kg/ha with seed at the time of sowing for its effective control. Green gram: Sowing: It is a major kharif pulse crop & cultivated with the onset of monsoon. Improved Varieties: Improved varieties are as follows: IPM-02-3, IPM-02-14, MH-421, MH-2-15, MH-1142, SML-668, GM-4, GM-5, IPM-409-4, IPM- 312-20. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 35 Seed Rate: Improved varieties seed of 12-15 kg is recommended for one ha area.
