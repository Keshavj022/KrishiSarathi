Types of Smart Sensors in Precision Agriculture In precision agriculture, various types of smart sensors play a crucial role in collecting essential agronomic data to inform data-driven decision-making and targeted interventions. Smart sensors consistently gather real-time data regarding critical agricultural factors such as soil moisture, temperature, nutrient concentrations, crop well-being, weather situations, and additional metrics. This constant stream of information allows farmers to monitor changes and respond promptly to evolving conditions. By gathering data across different loca- tions within the ﬁeld, smart sensors reveal spatial variability in soil properties and crop health. This insight enables farmers to identify areas with speciﬁc needs and apply resources pre- cisely where they are most beneﬁcial. Armed with accurate data from smart sensors, farmers can optimize resource appli- cations to match the precise requirements of each part of the ﬁeld. This precision applies to water, fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs, minimizing wastage and reducing environmen- tal impact. Smart sensors enable targeted interventions by providing early detection of pests, diseases, or stress factors in crops [7]. Early warning allows farmers to apply appro- priate treatments selectively and effectively, reducing the requirement for comprehensive chemical treatments. With climate change presenting unpredictable weather patterns, smart sensors aid in climate resilience. These data help farmers to adjust their practices to cope with changing con- ditions and protect their crops from extreme weather events. The wealth of data provided by smart sensors is analyzed using data analytics and AI tools. The consequent observa- tions enable farmers to make decisions grounded in data, reﬁning their management approaches for improved results.
