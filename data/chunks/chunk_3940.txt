Mulching insulates the soil and maintains the temperature beneficial for plant growth and improves the physical properties of the soil. Mulches, especially organic mulches are reportedly found to decrease soil compactness owing to the release of organic acids and increase in organic matter content of the soil. Mulches are very efficient in checking weed growth and preserving nutrients in the soil by reducing the loss of nutrients through profuse weed growth during the cropping season. Overall soil health is maintained and improved by way of soil conservation for efficient and sustainable crop production and productivity. y Impressive B:C ratio: Various trials conducted at different locations of high-altitude areas reported an improvement in profitability of vegetable production in terms of significant increments in net returns as well as in B:C ratio. Though the cost of cultivation of vegetables increased by 15 to 25% owing to the additional cost incurred on buying plastic mulch and its laying charges, vegetable production through the use of plastic mulch is found to be more cost- effective and remunerative due to cost-cutting in weed management and higher productivity. y Improved growth and yield of crop: The results of field experiments conducted in cold arid region of Leh-Ladakh indicated an overall improvement in the performance of vegetables in terms of yield, early yield, horticultural, and quality traits with the use of plastic mulch. y Improved water usage: Frequency of irrigation is reported to decrease in trials and demonstration conducted at Precision Farming Development Centre (PFDC) Leh, 20-33% water saving is achieved through plastic mulching in horticultural crops in the case of conventional irrigation methods. Plastic mulching reduces evapotranspiration losses from the fields, thereby conserving moisture in the root zones for longer periods and reducing the frequency of watering. Water application losses are minimum in the mulched fields; hence gross water requirement of the crop is comparatively low. Efficient water utilization is achieved through plastic mulching and moisture losses due to seepage are reduced. Plastic mulching checks weed growth eliminating the competition for moisture and nutrients between the weeds and the main crop.
