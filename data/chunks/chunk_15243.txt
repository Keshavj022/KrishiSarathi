 Applications of Smart Sensors in Precision Agriculture Smart sensors have a wide range of applications in precision agriculture, revolutionizing how farmers manage their crops and resources. These advanced sensors enable real-time data collection, monitoring, and analysis, empowering farmers to make reasoned decisions and optimize agricultural practices. As technology advances, smart sensors are expected to con- tinue evolving, opening up new possibilities for precision agriculture, and contributing to global food security. 5.1. Resource Management. Resource management, speciﬁ- cally focused on water, fertilizers, and pesticide optimization, is a critical aspect of sustainable agriculture and environ- mental stewardship. It involves implementing strategies and technologies to efﬁciently utilize these essential resources while minimizing waste and negative impacts on the eco- system [44]. 5.1.1. Water Optimization. Water is a limited and valuable resource, with agriculture using a substantial amount of it. Effective water management methods like drip irrigation, precision irrigation, and soil moisture sensors direct water directly to plant roots, minimizing evaporation and runoff [45]. Additionally, employing drought-resistant crop varie- ties and practicing rainwater harvesting can further optimize water usage. 5.1.2. Fertilizer Optimization. Fertilizers are crucial for enhancing crop yields, but their overuse can lead to environ- mental issues such as nutrient runoff and water pollution. Methods of precision agriculture, like variable rate applica- tion, empower farmers to apply fertilizers precisely where and when they are necessary, guided by soil nutrient levels and crop demands. Incorporating organic matter and cover crops can likewise enhance soil fertility and decrease reliance on artiﬁcial fertilizers [46]. 5.1.3. Pesticides Optimization. Pesticides are essential for controlling pests and diseases that can devastate crops, but their indiscriminate use can harm beneﬁcial organisms and lead to pesticide resistance. Integrated pest management (IPM) practices unite various strategies like biological control, crop rotation, and pest monitoring to minimize pesticide use while effectively managing pests. Targeted application methods and the use of selective pesticides can further optimize pest control efforts. Incorporating modern technologies like remote sensing, data analytics, and AI can signiﬁcantly enhance resource management. By adopting sustainable practices and optimiz- ing water, fertilizers, and pesticide usage, farmers can improve productivity, reduce costs, and mitigate the environmental impact of agriculture, promoting a more resilient and sustain- able future. 5.2. Precision Irrigation: Real-Time Water Delivery Based on Sensor Feedback. Precision irrigation is an advanced agricul- tural technique that involves delivering water to crops in a targeted and efﬁcient manner, based on real-time feedback from sensors.
