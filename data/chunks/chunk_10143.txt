 The Bhagavad Gita, Rig Veda and Atharva Veda contain details on agriculture like crop, cultivation, manuring, classification of herbs and different varieties of plants. In ancient India farmers used to start the agricultural practices such as ploughing, sowing, reaping and harvesting on auspicious days as these were linked with religious customs. The Rig Veda proclaimed that ‘May the ploughshares till our land properly; may the ploughmen go happily with the oxen’. Maharshi Bhrugu, son of Maharshi Varun, observed, “Food is the Brahma. Never speak ill about food. Never reject the food. Take an oath to produce plenty of food”. Krishi- Parashara with two hundred and forty-three verses is the theory of agriculture expounded in manner so as to benefit the farmers. Similarly, Vrikshayurveda discusses the science of plant life such as procuring, preserving and treating of seeds before planting; selection of soil and nourishment; and plant protection from internal and external diseases. Since the beginning of civilization, Indian agriculture has made significant progress. However, there has been several periods in Indian history, when food shortage made serious impacts on civilization. In the pre-Independent India, agriculture has been heavily Indian Agriculture: Achievements and Aspirations 3 dependent on climate. Unfavourable monsoon, particularly southwest monsoon causes droughts and crop failure. Such droughts, sometimes in consecutive years led to famines. Famines in India resulted in more than 30 million deaths over the course of the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries (Table 1). Table 1.

Great Bengal Famine 1943 2-3 Source: Adopted from IGI (1907) The famous quote of India’s first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru that ‘everything can wait but agriculture’ and Mahatma Gandhi’s observation that ‘there are people in the world so hungry, that God can not appear to them except in the form of bread’ signifies the importance of agriculture and the priority given to it after independence. The beginning happened with ‘Grow More Food, Campaign in 1947 which later moved with scientific vigour, planners’ rigour and millions of farmers’ hard work. In the co-existence of uncertainties of weather and declining soil health, increasing atmospheric temperature and emergence of more virulent pests and pathogens, the science-led agricultural development transformed India from an acutely food-scarce and food shortage to food sufficient to food surplus and food exporting country.
