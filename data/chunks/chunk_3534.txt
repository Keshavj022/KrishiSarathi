 Innovations in this field can have significant implications for crop yield, quality and sustainability. y Development of biodegradable and environment friendly materials for fruit bags, reducing plastic waste and its environmental impact. Innovations in bio-based polymers and compostable materials are paving the way for more sustainable bagging practices. y Manufacturing bags with UV-blocking properties to shield fruits from harmful ultraviolet radiation, which can cause sunburn and affect fruit quality. y Incorporate nutrients or bioactive compounds into Table 1. Effect of pre-harvest fruit bagging in fruit crops. Fruit crop/ Cultivar Time of bagging Type of bagging material Conclusion Mango ‘Keitt’ 100 days before harvest White paper bags Reduced the incidence and severity of anthracnose and stem-end rot Apple ‘Imperial Gala’ 40 days after flowering Transparent micro-perforated plastic or non-textured fabric bags Control of fruit fly, oriental fruit moth, apple leaf roller and woolly apple aphid Apple ‘Gamhong’ 4-5 weeks after full bloom Ca-coated paper bags Reduction in bitter pit Mango Pre-harvest Brown paper bags Reduction in the incidence of fruit fly, maintained higher total soluble sugars and better physical quality of fruit (types of bagging materials, size, time of bagging in different crops used, their benfits etc may be included) the bagging material. This allows for the controlled release of substances that can positively influence fruit development and quality. y Incorporating nano-coatings or antimicrobial properties into the bagging material to prevent microbial growth, reduce spoilage, and extend fruit shelf life. y Integration of sensors and monitoring devices within the fruit bags to assess fruit growth, quality, and health. This data can be used for real-time decision- making and precise management of the crop. y Automation technologies, including robotics, are being integrated into bagging processes. Automated systems can efficiently cover fruits with bags, ensuring uniform application and reducing labour costs. CONCLUSION Fruit bagging is a time-tested technique that provides a multitude of advantages to fruit crop cultivation, from pest and disease management to improving fruit quality and appearance. This practice not only enhances the marketability of fruits but also aligns with the principles of sustainable agriculture by reducing the need for chemical pesticides and aligning well with sustainable and organic farming practices, which are increasingly gaining recognition and support. Its importance in modern agriculture cannot be underestimated. For modern fruit farmers, incorporating fruit bagging into their cultivation methods is a wise choice, offering both economic and environmental benefits.
