 The Committee recommends that after acceptance of the report by the competent authority, this document should be published as operational manual for use of KVK system and should be provided to all the administration and development departments in the district. There should not be any deviation while implementing the mandate of KVKs, irrespective of the variable rules and regulations of the host organizations. Since this is a dynamic process, this should be revisited every five years based on the changing scenario.
