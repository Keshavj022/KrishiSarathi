 The BN hybrid grass on the bunds with their taller and denser growth acted as natural windbreaks, reducing the intensity of hot winds blowing across the fields. Economic impact: Farmers have reported significant economic benefits from adopting this practice. The availability of fodder on bunds reduces the need to purchase expensive external fodder for livestock particularly in lean periods, thereby lowering the cost of livestock rearing. Yield advantages of about 10-15% were also observed in cauliflower grown in summer. Uttam Rajpoot also sells rooted slips of BN hybrid grass (` 15,000-20,000 every year) to other farmers. Community impact and scaling up The success of fodder on bunds in Uttam Rajpoot’s field did not go unnoticed by other farmers in Indian Farming 30 October 2024 the community. His positive experience with the practice encouraged neighbouring farmers to adopt the technology, especially after seeing the visible improvements in his livestock and vegetable crops. With the support of IGFRI and the FFP, fodder on bunds technology is being scaled up across more farms in Jhansi district. Farmer field days and community meetings are regularly organized to demonstrate the benefits and share knowledge with other farmers. The simplicity and cost-effectiveness of this method make it accessible to farmers with limited resources, and its multiple benefits ensure that it can be integrated into various types of farming systems. The successful implementation of fodder on bunds under the FFP has the potential to be a game-changer for smallholder farmers across semi-arid regions of India. SUMMARY Agriculture and animal husbandry are deeply connected to Indian society, culturally and economically. Despite having the world’s largest livestock population, India’s livestock productivity is low due to fodder deficits. A regional shortage, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas, exacerbates this issue. Farmers like Uttam Rajpoot from Palinda village of Jhansi district, who raise vegetables and livestock, grapple with erratic rainfall and limited land, making fodder cultivation challenging. The Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute introduced the 'fodder on bunds' technique under the FFP. It involves growing BN hybrid grass on bunds, utilizing underused land. This approach provides year-round fodder, improves soil and water conservation, and protects adjoining crops from heatwaves. Uttam Rajpoot, who implemented this method on his 3-acre land, now produces 100-130 quintals of green fodder annually from 300-meter bunds, saving money on fodder and improving livestock health. Additionally, the grass shields his vegetable crops from extreme summer heatwaves, boosting yields. The resource-efficient technology is gaining traction among farmers, helping sustain both agriculture and livestock in Bundelkhand regions. *Corresponding author email: selmukesh@gmail.
