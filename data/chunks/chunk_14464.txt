Correlation plots during dry years ACZ I: 2002–03 (a) NVSWI vs. VHI, (b) SPI vs. NVSWI (c) NVSWI vs. GPP; ACZ II: 2014–15 (d) NVSWI vs. VHI, (e) SPI vs. NVSWI (f) VHI vs. GPP; ACZ III: 2016–17 (g) NVSWI vs. VHI, (h) SPI vs. NVSWI (i) NVSWI vs. GPP. L. Kaur et al. Agricultural Water Management 274 (2022) 107956 14 between NVSWI and SPI in ACZ I indicated the importance of rainfall for crop growth in hot arid areas [Fig. 9(b)]. In 2002–03, a major part of the ACZ I was under severe to slight drought, and SPI values were also low during that year, so it was also subjected to corresponding lowering of gross primary productivity. GPP also indicated a very strong positive correlation with the NVSWI [Figs. 9 and 10 (c, f, i)], thus showing the effectiveness of the NVSWI to capture the organic carbon productivity of wheat. Although SPI-12 indicated a dry season during the year 2014–15 in ACZ II and nearly 38% of its area was under severe to slight drought conditions, the spatial extent of the drought was much lower than the drought extent of 2009–10. The high drought extent shown by NVSWI in the year 2009–10 (Fig. 8) might be due to the lower rainfall in different parts of all the ACZs (Fig. 3). Irrigation has a significant impact on raising soil moisture, which enhances the green vegetation fraction and gross primary output (Wu et al., 2018). The moderate positive correla­ tion between SPI and NVSWI in ACZ I and ACZ II, and the insignificant correlation in ACZ III during dry [Fig. 9(b, e, h)] and normal year [Fig. 10 (b, e, h)] might be due to the prevalence of groundwater-based irrigation practices in the area. When considering the correlation be­ tween NVSWI and SPI in ACZ III, the correlation was insignificant during dry [Fig. 9(h)] as well as normal year [Fig. 10 (h)]. During the normal rainfall year, i.e., 2018–19, the whole study area was free from drought, and an increase in NVSWI, VHI, and GPP values was also observed. A significant positive correlation was again observed between NVSWI and VHI during the normal year (2018–19) in all the ACZs [Fig. 10 (a, d, g)]. Low NVSWI values indicate drought conditions, and under drought conditions, the plants do not get sufficient water for their metabolic activities, which hinders their normal photosynthetic activities and their stored organic carbon also gets reduced. The strong positive correlation between NVSWI and GPP (ACZ I (r) = 0.954; ACZ II (r) = 0.811; and ACZ III (r) = 0.
