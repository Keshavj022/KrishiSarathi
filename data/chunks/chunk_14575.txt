 Availability of food impacts nutrition, as women purchase these food items, such as raw ingredients to prepare meals. In this context, from our field knowledge, we observed that women often buy their weekly gro­ ceries from a local market nearby their respective villages. To control for the impact of availability, we control for Pvt,which represents the vector of prices of raw food items purchased from a nearby market. Zihvtrefers to individual-level factors that are time-varying, such as whether the individual is sick or not on the interview day. Hhvt includes all the household-level factors that are time-varying, such as non-food expen­ ditures or whether an individual is sick in the household. Seasonality plays a critical role in nutrition, as variations in the climate such as rainfall and temperature can impact the consumption of nutrients and the amount of time spent in agriculture. Women’s tasks vary with the seasons, impacting their time spent in agriculture, and their involvement in nutrition-enhancing activities may be affected due to this variation. To our knowledge, this is the first study that empirically controls for seasonality in this framework to analyze the impacts across seasons. We construct a season variable by clustering the months, based on major agricultural activity periods: land preparation (April–May), sowing (June–July), transplanting (August–September), and harvesting (Octo­ ber–November) and (December to January). 4. Results 4.1. Sample characteristics Chandrapur district has a population of 2.2 million, according to the Census of India, 2011. Table 1 shows the summary statistics of the sample used for this study. Initially, 960 households were sampled, but six households dropped out during the ten months due to death or permanent migration among these families, reducing the total to 954 households. The average size of the families is about four, reflecting a more nuclear nature of families. The average age of women is around 37 years, and about 47 percent of the sample has no education or primary education. The average number of children under the age of 18 is 1.14 Table 1 Summary statistics (full sample).

Twenty-four percent of households have access to irrigation. Otherwise, agriculture is mainly rainfed in this region.
