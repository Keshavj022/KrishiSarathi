Crop advisories for kharif rice a. Long duration HYVs of kharif rice such as semi dwarf rice varieties (150 – 155 days) like Ranjit, Bahadur etc., tall varieties like Mahsuri (140 – 145 days), glutinous rice varieties (150 – 160 days) like Aghoni, Bhogalee and scented rice varieties (155 – 160 days) like Ketekijoha, Bakuljoha etc. are to be transplanted within July with 30 -35 days old seedling. It is always advisable to complete transplanting within early part of July as in some varieties like Ranjit low temperature may affect panicle emergence. Medium duration (135 days) varieties like Shraboni, Mulagabharu, Numali or other suitable varieties should also be transplanted during July in double cropped areas. b. Staggered planting rice varieties (having flexibility in seedling age) like Gitesh (150-160 days) and Prafulla (150-160 days) can be transplanted starting from July with 30 days old seedling up to 60 days old seedlings where transplanting in time is not possible with 30 -35 days old seedling due to drought like situations or due to flood c. Kharif rice varieties like Ranjit Sub 1, Bahadur Sub 1, Swarna Sub 1 having 145 -150 days crop duration which can withstand 10 -12 days water submergence after crop establishment should be transplanted in July in chronically or occasionally flood affected areas. d. In chronically flood affected areas, where flood water recedes during the last part of August and transplanting is possible during last part of August, short duration varieties such as Luit, Kolong, Dishang etc. can also be grown (transplanting up to last part of August) with 20-25 days old seedling at 20x15 cm spacing with 4-5 seedlings/hill. Otherwise, traditional photosensitive coarse grain varieties with 60 days old seedlings (6-8 seedlings per hill) can be transplanted up to last part of August even up to 1st week of September. If the crop field is damaged by flood water during the last part of August and there is no time for seedling raising or in areas where transplanting is not possible before mid September, direct seeding of sprouted seeds of some extra short duration HYVs like Luit, Kapilee, Dichang etc. (100 days) in puddled field @ 75 kg/ ha is also recommended. e. Seed selection and nursery management in kharif rice yy For sowing in the nursery bed, rice seed should be put in plain water and floated seeds should be rejected. After selection, seeds should be soaked for 24 hours in fungicidal solutions prepared with Mancozeb @ 2.5 g per litre of water or Captan @ 2.5 g per litre of water or Bavistin @ 2.5 g per litre of water.
