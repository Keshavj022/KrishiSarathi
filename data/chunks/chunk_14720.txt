 However, in case of scenarios with improved management practices (Sc2), continuous flooding (5–7 cm depth) was provided in the initial 15–20 days after transplanting fol­ lowed by irrigation at −40 to −50 kPa matric potential at 15 cm depth up to one week prior to flowering followed by irrigation at −15 to −20 kPa. In ZT direct seeded rice, soil was kept moist for the initial 20 days followed by irrigation at − 20 to − 30 kPa matric potential. In maize, wheat and mungbean irrigation was done need based. The main sources of fertilizers were urea (46% N), di-ammonium phosphate (DAP: 18% N and 46% P), muriate of potash (MOP: 60% K) and NPK complex fertilizer (12:32:16) to take care of the nutrient requirement. In Sc1, no potassic fertilizer was added to mimic farmers practice based on the farmer’s field survey in that region. In Sc2, Sc3, Sc4, Sc5 and Sc6, 32 kg K ha−1 was applied in wheat and 60 and 62 kg K ha−1was applied in rice and maize, respectively. Recommended doses of N and P were added in all the plots. A total of 0, 154, 137, 160, 141 and 162 t ha−1 of residue load were added in Sc1, Sc2, Sc3, Sc4, Sc5 and Sc6, respectively from 2009 to 2020. The complete information on nutrient, water and weed manage­ ment can be obtained from Gathala et al. (2013) for all the scenarios. The best management practices for weed, pests and nutrients were adopted for all the scenarios except Sc1. 2.2. Soil sampling, processing and analysis Soil samples were collected after 11 years of experimental set up. As wheat is the common crop under all the scenarios, therefore soil samples for this study were collected after the harvest of wheat crop in the year 2020 to study the effect of management practices on K availability. The soil samples were collected from 0 to 15 cm soil depth with the help of auger with an internal diameter of 5 cm and length of 5 cm. In the event of sampling, each plot was divided into four subplots of 50 m × 10 m dimension. Within each grid soil samples were taken from 9 different locations and mixed thoroughly to prepare a composite sample. Samples were then air dried on plastic sheets followed by crushing the clods with the help of wooden hammer. The soils were passed through 2 mm sieve and stored in polythene bags and labeled properly. The soil samples were then analyzed for available K as outlined by Jackson (1973); 5 g soil was taken in 100 mL conical flask. Then 25 mL of 1N NH4OAC was added to it and shaken for 5 min at 130 rpm in a mechanical shaker. The content was filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper and analyzed for K using flame photometer. The available K content was expressed in mg kg−1. For conversion in kg ha−1, the value can be multiplied with a factor of 2.24 (weight of top soil at 0–15 cm depth, in 1ha area is taken as 2.24 ×106 kg). 2.3. Quantity-intensity isotherm and its parameters The concept of Q/I relationship in soil was firstly introduced by Woodruff (1955) and further explained by Beckett (1964a).
