 Potassium intensity The Q/I curve for all the scenarios have been represented in the Fig. 3. The concentration ratio of K+ (CRe K) in equilibrium solutions in­ dicates the intensity of labile K. It is the measure of K+ which can be immediately and easily available to the crops. With increase in the equilibrium concentration of K, the values of CRe K also increased (Fig. 3) and the lowest CRe K values with no addition of K was obtained in Sc1 and the highest value was observed in Sc6, the range of CRe K varied from 1.00 to 1.71 (mol L−1)1/2 × 10−3. In case of maximum concentration of equilibrium solution (i.e. 3 mmol K L−1), the maximum CRe K was ob­ tained in Sc2 and minimum at Sc3. Values ranged from 32.1 to 22.9 (mol L−1) 1/2 × 10−3. 3.2.2. Potassium quantity Change in labile K with increase and decrease of equilibrium con­ centration is measured by the quantity factor. The value of ± Δ K Fig. 3.

Equation of linear part of the Q/I isotherm is mentioned for each scenario.Sc1- conventional rice-wheat system, Sc2- partial CA-based rice-wheat-mungbean system, Sc3- CA-based rice-wheat-mungbean system, Sc4- CA-based maize-wheat-mungbean system, Sc5- CA-based rice-wheat-mungbean system + SDI system, Sc6- CA-based maize-wheat-mungbean + SDI system. K. Rani et al. Soil & Tillage Research 228 (2023) 105644 6 increased gradually with increase in K concentration from 0 to 3 mmol K L−1 (Fig. 3). In all the cases it was observed that the point after which adsorption began or the point up to which desorption continued was 0.25 mmol K L−1 of applied K+ or approximately 10 mg L−1 of K addition. The value of ± ΔK at the highest level of K application (3 mmol K L−1) was in the range of 1.06–1.46 cmol kg−1, lowest and highest was associated with Sc2 and Sc3, respectively. Higher adsorp­ tion values indicate higher fixation of K on clay surfaces and vice versa. Both CT (Sc1) and partial CA (Sc2) were poor in maintaining the quantity factor as compared to full CA based scenarios. 3.2.3. Equilibrium potassium concentration ratio (CRe 0K) The intercept on the X axis where ΔK = 0 represents the equilibrium activity ratio. The value of CRe 0K varied from the lowest 1.02 (mol L−1) 1/ 2 × 10−3 in Sc1 to the highest value of 3.28 (mol L−1) 1/2 × 10−3 in Sc6 (Table 2). Scenario 2 had the second highest CRe 0K value of 1.93 (mol L−1) 1/2 × 10−3 followed by Sc4. However, here the values suggest more K adsorption in specific sites. Results indicate that CA based scenarios (both partial and full CA) had better K availability to maintain higher CRe 0K than Sc1. Also, the differences due to the method of irrigation was also prominently observed for this parameter with SDI performing better than flooding method of irrigation.
