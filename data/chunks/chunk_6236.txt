Yield and physical characteristics of Cassia tora leaf extract at CIRG Parameter Cassia tora extract Yield (%) 20.5 Colour Dark green Smell sweet Nature Oily Solubility Methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol Chemical constituents Reaction Flavonoids + Glycosides + Steroids - Tannins + Coumarins - Alkaloids - Saponins + Proteins - Fat and oils - Carbohydrates + consistency and dehydration status, which were categorized on scoring basis and changes in serum biochemical parameters. Overall therapeutic efficacy of takala leaf juice was 60%, which suggested that the juice of takala leaves at the tested concentration was moderately effective in bacterial diarrhoea in goats (Tables 3 and 4). No untoward reaction was noticed during treatment and serum biochemical parameters did not indicate toxicity of ITK (Table 4). Phyto-chemical analysis Yield (%), physical characteristic and qualitative analysis revealed the presence of flavinoids, glycosides, tannin, saponins and carbohydrate (Tables 5 and 6).

Rest of the entire disc did not reveal any zone of inhibition (Fig. 1). It indicated that Cassia tora extract had antibacterial property against E.coli at higher concentration only (Table 7). CONCLUSION The initial validation study using ITK (flower juice of takala in treatment of diarrhoea was Fig. 1. Antobiogram of Cassia tora leaf extract conducted at Veterinary College, MASFSU, Nagpur. The findings recorded moderate degree of effectiveness of the ITK against parasitic diarrhoea in goats.
