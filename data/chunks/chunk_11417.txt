 About 300-500g of seeds are sufficient for raising nursery to plant one hectare. Prior to sowing seeds are treated with Trichoderma viride (4 g/ kg of seed) or Thiram (3g/ kg of seed). Fertilizer Management: For good yield, 15-20 tonnes of well- decomposed FYM should be incorporated into the soil about 4 weeks before transplanting. Generally, application of 80-120 kg N, 60-100kg P2O5 and 60-120 kg K2O is recommended for optimum yield. Half the dose of N and entire amount of P and K is given at the time of transplanting. The balance N is given six weeks after transplanting or at the time of earthing up. Harvesting and Yield: Cabbage is ready for harvest at 90-120 days after planting. Cabbage should be harvested promptly when the ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 156 heads are firm and mature. Average yield obtained from early varieties is 25-30 t/ha and that of late type is 40-60 t/ha. Cutworm: As a preventive measure apply Methyl Parathion or Malathion (5% dust) @10kg/acre in soil before sowing. Leaf Eating Caterpillar, if infestation is observed in field to control of leaf eating caterpillars spray Dichlorvos@200ml/150Ltr water or Flubendiamide 48%S.C@0.5ml/3Ltr of water. Incidence of sucking pest like Aphid and Jassid is observed spray Imidacloprid 17.8SL @ 60ml/acre using 150 Ltr water. Leaf spot or blight control take spray of Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64%WP@ 250gm/150Ltr of water along with sticker. Vegetable Pea It gives best results when grown under well drained soil with pH range of 6 to 7.5. Crop cannot withstand in water logging conditions. For acidic soil, do liming. Varieties: Azad P1, Azad P 3, Azad P 4, Azad P 5, Arkel Sowing time between end of October to Middle November and for early on 15 September. Apply 8 tons of farmyard manure, 20 kg of N (45 kg Urea) and 25 kg P2O5 (155 kg Superphosphate) per acre before sowing. Pendimethalin@1 lt/acre and Basalin@1 lt/ acre give good results in controlling the weeds. Wilt: The roots turn black and the later rot away. Control by treat seeds with Thiram@3gm/ lt water and avoid early sowing in badly affected areas and crop rotation. Powdery Mildew: Patchy, White powdery growth appears on lower side of leaves, branches, and pods. Three times spray Karathane 40EC@80 ml in 100 water per acre at 10 days interval. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 157 Carrot Loamy or sandy loam soils with enough humus is well suited to the cultivation of carrots. The ideal pH range for obtaining a good yield is 5.5-6.5. The optimum temperature for growth between 16 to 20 °C, while temperatures above 28°C drastically reduce top growth. Seed rate: 5 to 6 kg /ha. Varieties: pusa kesar, Pusa meghali, Pusa vrishti Fertilizer Management: 20-30 tonnes of FYM/ ha should be applied at the time of field preparation. 50 kg N, 50 kg P and 100 kg k/ ha is recommended. Nematodes: To control nematodes, apply neem cake@0.5ton/acre at time of sowing.
