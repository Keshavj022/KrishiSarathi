 The DAC indented release of Pusa Mangal has never been less than 200 q from 2016-17 and it was in the top 10 DAC indented wheat varieties during rabi 2018-19. The indent of HI 8713 during 2016-17 (248.8 q), 2017-18 (288 q), 2018-19 (462.2 q), 2019-20 (202 q) and 2020-21 (270 q) indicates the demand for the seed of Pusa Mangal among farmers. Export potential of Indian Durum wheat Durum wheat has a special niche in the Indian wheat economy. Indian durum wheat is typically purchased by the private trade at a premium price, mainly for processing high HI 8713 (Pusa Mangal) Grain Table 4.

There is also a huge potential of earning foreign exchange through the export of quality grain and value-added products. The grain and nutritional quality of durum wheat varieties: HI 8663, HI 8713, HI 8737, HI 8759 and HI 8777, viz. grain protein content (>13%), high iron (>45 ppm), high zinc (>40 ppm), yellow pigment (>6 ppm) content is in comparison with Canadian and Australian durums, which makes Indian durum wheat highly potent for export. However, the availability of exportable durum is limited and due to the lack of gradation system for durum wheat, it gets mixed with bread wheat in local markets. Special grading system and strict policies by the government in the procurement of durum wheat and preparation of pasta products from durum wheat only can boost the Indian pasta manufacturing industries and durum wheat growers. SUMMARY Durum wheat cultivation is found to be highly profitable in central India due to varieties having high yield potential, rust resistance and high tolerance to drought and heat, which ensure more production with less irrigation. Around 13% of increase in durum wheat area was found in Madhya Pradesh compared to the durum wheat area in the last 5 years.
