 Providing training and technical support to farmers and system operators enhances their understanding of the technology and empowers them to utilize it effectively, ensuring long-term sustainability. Emphasizing the importance of accurate and reliable data collection, including sensor calibration and maintenance, mitigates errors and enhances the system's performance app which can be used by any user. Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report During the growing season of the sweet corn crops the water depths applied (mm) in loT- based and ETc-based drip irrigation was compared at 10-day intervals. The first row of Table 1 shows 20 mm of irrigation applied immediately after planting to bring the soil to its capacity. Drip irrigation with 100% ETC had the highest amount of water applied, followed by drip irrigation with 100% FC and 80% FC with loT. In total, 443.7 mm, 393.6 mm, and 356.2 mm of irrigation were applied by groundwater (as blue water) under 100 % ETc-based drip irrigation, 100% FC loT-based drip irrigation, and 80% FC loT-based drip irrigation, respectively. During the growing season, irrigation water applied to the ETc-based treatments increased exponentially with ETo. Compared to ETC 100% drip irrigation, loT-based drip irrigation 100% FC and 80% FC used 12.7% and 24.5% less irrigation water, respectively.

Lessons learned Customizing irrigation systems to the specific requirements of different crops, soil types, and microclimates within a region maximizes the system's effectiveness and acceptance among farmers. Providing training and technical support to farmers and system operators enhances their understanding of the technology and empowers them to utilize it effectively, ensuring long-term sustainability. Emphasizing the importance of accurate and reliable data collection, including sensor calibration and maintenance, mitigates errors and enhances the system's performance app which can be used by any user.
