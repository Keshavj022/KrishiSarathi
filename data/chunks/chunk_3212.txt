Agronomic Management Suggested seed rates for different situations Rainfed Irrigated Varieties 6‐7 (kg/ha) 5‐6 (kg/ha) Hybrids 5‐6 (kg/ha) 4‐5 (kg/ha) Pre-soaking and seed treatment For quick germination and better stand establishment in dryland conditions, soak the seed in fresh water (1:1 W/V) for about 14 hours and shade dry. Seed should be treated with thiram or captan @ 2‐3 g/kg of seed to protect from seed‐borne diseases. Seed treatment with metalaxyl @ 6 g/kg can protect the crop against downy mildew disease. Treat the seed with imidacloprid @ 5 or 6 g/kg seed before sowing against insect vectors for the necrosis management. www.icar.org.in 98 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science Spacing and plant population In general, prefer wider spacing of 60 cm between rows and 30 cm within the row for hybrids and long duration populations. For short duration and dwarf varieties (Morden), follow 45 x 30 cm spacing.
