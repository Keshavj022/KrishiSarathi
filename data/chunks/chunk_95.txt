 In before earthing up cultivation, oat were sown with potato and cultivated in 30-40 days before earthing up of potato. In after earthing up cultivation, oat was sown after earthing up of potato and harvesting after 45 days. Production was higher in after earthing up cultivation (36.42 q/acre) practice than before earthing up cultivation (25.09 q/acre) practice. Some other examples include grain sorghum where intercropping of cowpea is done. In grain pigeon pea, intercropping of forage sorghum, maize, bajra and Table 2.

This issue becomes more pronounced in the eastern parts of the region, where agricultural resources, especially arable land and water, are increasingly scarce. The scarcity of fodder has a widespread impact on farmers, but it is especially severe for those who are landless or have access to only small plots of land. Similarly, the availability of green fodder round the year especially during summer months for sustained and economical milk production in these areas is of utmost importance. The dairy farmers have been looking forward to improved technology for continuous flow of green fodder throughout out the year. In general, the dairy farmers are suggested to harness the below mentioned fodder cycle (Table 1) for round the year fodder production at their farms. However, in absence of fodder land, they can use the innovative approaches mentioned below as per the feasibility of land and resources.
