 Following the initiation of the graduate level programmes by the Agricultural Research Institute beginning 1905, a two-year postgraduate diploma, also known as “IARI Associateship”, was initiated at the then Imperial Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa in 1923. On the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Agriculture (1928), Imperial (now Indian) Council of Agricultural Research was created in 1929 to provide further impetus and support to the already existing Agricultural Research Institutes. In the early 1930s, postgraduate programmes leading to M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in agriculture were started. The Madras Veterinary College with affiliation from the University of Madras in 1936 launched a 4-year B.V.Sc. course. Further thrust to veterinary education was given with the establishment of five more veterinary colleges between 1946 and 1948 at Mathura (1946), Rajendra Nagar (1946), Jabalpur (1948), Jorhat (1948) and Hisar (1948). Before the start of these veterinary colleges, a degree courses in agricultural engineering began in the early 1940s at the Allahabad Agricultural Institute (now a deemed to be university). By 1947 - the year of India’s independence, there were 17 agricultural colleges affiliated to general universities. After independence, Govt. of India appointed University Education Commission under the Chairmanship of Dr. S. Radhakrishnan to review higher education and suggest measures for meeting the future requirement of the country. The Commission recommended that Agricultural Education be recognized as a major national priority so that the country is able to feed itself. The Commission recommended establishment of autonomous rural universities and accord them same facilities as were available to other universities including substantial grant-in-aid from the centre for development. Based on Dr. S. Radhakrishnan Commission on University Education and subsequent two Joint Indo-American Study Teams (1955, 1959) recommendations, first agricultural University was set up in Pantnagar in 1960, which paved the way for establishment of agricultural universities in other states.
