 Achievements in Field Crops in Independent India 83 Box 2: Pusa Basmati 1121- making the country a rice exporter Pusa Basmati 1121 (PB 1121) is a milestone in Basmati rice improvement. The milled rice of PB 1121 is extra-long slender, appealing taste, pleasant aroma, good mouth feel and easy digestibility. During 2006-2020 contributed to ~35% of the breeder seed indented for Basmati rice in India. In terms of total economic surplus, PB 1121 has generated ` 52334 crores (at 2020-21 prices), and ` 66007 crores at constant prices (base year: 2011-12). The approximate cumulative earning due to export of PB 1121 since 2008 has been estimated to be ` 2,00,000 crores. 3.2. Wheat Wheat is an important staple food, next to rice, serving as an integral part of food and nutritional security. The total wheat produced in the country accounts for nearly 37% of the food grains production. Since 2014-15, the country has witnessed a consecutive record output of wheat surpassing the 100 Mt mark in 2018-19. The production has witnessed a massive increase of over 16 times from 6.46 Mt (1950-51) to 109.52 Mt (2020-21) (Fig. 2). The change in production, since the independence, is attributed to several factors, especially the high-yielding varieties, fertilizer & irrigation intensification and synergy between technology, extension, policy, and institutions (Singh et al. 2019). Efforts are being made to attain the target of 140 Mt by 2050 amidst several production constraints and challenges. Fig. 2. Area, production and productivity of wheat in India Indian Agriculture after Independence 84 The quantum jump in wheat production is largely attributed to several interventions in the form of wide adoption of high yielding semi-dwarf varieties like Sonara 64, Lerma Rojo, and Sonalika during 1970s; increased use of mechanization in the progressive states like Punjab and Haryana during 1980s; intensive promotion of the newly released improved wheat varieties and management technologies during 1990s; introduction of 1B/1R translocation leading to the release of a mega variety PBW 343 in 1995; popularization of resource conservation technologies in the early 2000s; release and wide spread of promising varieties like HD 2967, HD 3086 and DBW 187 in the recent decade (2010s) (Singh et al. 2019). More than 448 cultivars were released since 1964-65 including several landmark varieties like C 306, HD 2329, WL 711, HD 2009, UP 262, HD 2189, HUW 234, WH 147, HI 617 (Sujata), Lok 1, HD 2285, Raj 3765, PBW 343, PBW 502, HD 2967, HD 2733, HD 3086, DBW 17, GW 496, GW 273, PBW 550, GW 322, DBW 187, DBW 222 in bread wheat; and Raj 1555, PBW 34, HI 8498 and PDW 233 in durum wheat that led to over 16 fold increase in wheat production since 1950-51. Wheat rust epidemics had been very frequent worldwide and latest were caused by Yr9 virulence world over and Ug99 pathotype has spread to twelve wheat-growing countries.
