This variety falls under the medium maturity group for fresh consumption (170-180 days after planting). Average corm weight is 1706.12 g with a total yield of 44.84 t/ha which is 26.10 % higher than the national check Gajendra and 18.91 % superior Indian Horticulture 14 Propagation and planting technique of elephant foot yam to the local check Chikhli Local. This variety is reported to have an appreciable amount of starch, dietary fibre, energy, protein, Vitamin A, Fe, Mn, Zn and Ca in its fresh weight basis. No acridity has been found (10.53 mg / 100 g Ca-oxalate) while consumption after cooking. It is field resistant to collar rot and has a very little incidence of Phytophthora blight. Corm shape is elliptical with brown epidermis. Flesh of corm is light orange in colour. Farmers of Gujarat appreciated this variety due to much higher productivity and very low disease incidence. Corm flesh without acridity with attractive colour, smooth texture, good flavour, taste and softness make it more preferable.
