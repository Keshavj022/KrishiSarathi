 Breeding, Culture and Larval Rearing of Freshwater Giant Prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii A production of 450 kg prawn, 2,587 kg F1 hybrid carp and 574 kg catla/ha was obtained in polyculture with stocking densities of 7,000 prawn and 11,000 carps/ha in Andaman. A small unit was set up for breeding and larval rearing of freshwater prawn M. rosenbergii. Gravid prawns weighing 25–40 g with eggs of yellow to orange colour released zoea @ 200/g body weight. The larval rearing was successfully done and juveniles could be produced. Social Science An application of pre-emergent herbicide Butachlor controlled the weed density by 3–6 times and significantly increased the net return at the farmer’s field. The salt-tolerant BTS 24 rice recorded 30% more yield than the local variety C 14-8. Bacterial wilt-tolerant LE 3704 tomato gave 350% higher fruit yield and more net returns than BT 1, which was more susceptible to wilt. Krishi Vigyan Kendra The Krishi Vigyan Kendra has conducted 41 programmes on crop production, horticulture, livestock, home science, fishery and front-line demonstration. A total of 471 men and 477 women got trained in agriculture and allied activities. l NARDI 110, a new high-yielding rice, performed better in on-farm testing and showed tolerance to stem-borer, gundhi bug attack and could withstand lodging. The yield was 4.75 tonnes/ha. l In on-farm testing BWR line LE 3704 of tomato yielded 25.3 tonnes/ha with 43.82% increase in yield, followed by BT 1 (19.7 tonnes/ha) and local check (17.5 tonnes/ha). l On-farm trial on watermelon showed that variety Sugar Baby gave an yield of 20.5 tonnes/ha with 57.69% increase in yield, followed by NS 1 (20.3 tonnes/ha). Kin-nu cucumber gave an yield of 9.7 tonnes/ha, showing 55% increase in yield. BTS 24 rice gave an yield of 3.0 tonnes/ha, compared with 2.01 tonnes/ha of local cultivar C 14-8. Partial harvest of prawn from polyculture systems with carps DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 192 4. National Agricultural Technology Project The National Agricultural Technology Project (NATP), a World Bank-aided project, is being implemented by the ICAR and the Department of Agriculture and Co- operation (DAC) since November 1998. It has three major components, viz. Organization and Management (O&M) System, Research and Innovations in Technology Dissemination (ITD). The ICAR executes the O&M, Research and a part of ITD. The progress made during the year under different components in the NATP is presented here. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ICAR Reforms The Organization and Management (O & M) Task Force, the apex body for supervising and guiding the reforms process, constituted several sub-committees and hired consultancies on various aspects of reforms. The key outcomes of recommendations of these are given below. l Recommendations were made on 17 wide-ranging issues of administration, management, personnel policies and decentralization of powers, and 16 of those have been accepted.
