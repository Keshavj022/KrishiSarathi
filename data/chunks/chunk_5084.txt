Within 2_3 days after bending, planofix @ 5 ml/10 litres water and metacid @ 10 ml/10 litres are applied. Manures and fertilizers are applied and the field is irrigated 15 days before the bending operation. When the new shoots start emerging from the naked bent portion of the branch, the tying is removed. Twelve respondents were selected randomly among the orchard owners. During discussion it was revealed that most of the orchard owners followed the same practice. The varieties which are grown in Baruipur are: (i) Baruipur Local, (ii) Teli, (iii) Bhagalpur, (iv) Allahabad Safeda, (v) Khaja, and (vi) Kabri. The ITK is practised in all the above- mentioned varieties except kabri, and is very much effective and produces profuse flowering. Kabri is a small-fruited tree with good fruit colour and taste. It has good market value, irrespective of the size of the fruits. Results obtained indicated that the practice is very much effective and produces profuse flowering (Tables 1 and 2). Bending in autumn was more effective than when done in summer. Experiment The investigation was carried out on two cultivars, viz. Allahabad Safeda and khaja. Allahabad safeda Days required to emerge new shoot The data presented in Table 3 show that season of bending has a profound effect on morphological changes and fruit yield of the plant. Table 2.

Earliness in shoot emergence was also noted in other treatments during summer bending. Warm humid condition during summer probably favoured the early emergence of new shootlets. Number of new shootlets per branch The summer season of bending increased number of new shotlets per branch (21.4) than autumn season of bending (13.9). The same trend of increment in number of new shootlets per brahch was noted in other treatments during summer season (Table 3).
