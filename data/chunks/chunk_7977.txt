1 g as compared to the control (138 kg/tree with 2,225 fruits/tree having 62 g fruit weight). The same intervention at Palghar gave higher yield of 146 kg/tree with 1,815 fruits/tree having 80.3 g fruit weight as compared to control (101.6 kg/tree with 1,469 fruits/tree having 68.8 g fruit weight). Vegetable : Integrated application of FYM@ 25 tonnes/ha + biofertilizers (PSB + Azotobacter/ rhizobium) increased the yield of okra, cowpea and bottle gourd in zaid by 27.5, 40.1 and 8.33 %, respectively. In rabi season, integrated application of NADEP compost @ 25 tonnes/ha + biofertilizers (PSB+ Azotobacter/rhizobium) increased the yield of cabbage and pea by 12.8 and 23.5 %, respectively over conventional inorganic system. There was significant improvement (61.5% more) in number of fruits (16.7/ plant) and yield (3.03 kg/plant; 27.03 t/ha) in cucumber with potassium nutrition at 80 kg/ha in two splits, viz. 25% in soil (pre- sowing) and 75% ( p o s t - m e r g e n c e ) through drip irrigation. Pre-emergence application of pendimethalin 30 EC before planting and one hand weeding 45 days after transplanting showed 340% more yield than the control and 127% more yield than recommended practice (Oxyflurofen 23.5% EC application before planting + one hand weeding 40 days after transplanting) in onion. Tuber crops: Drip irrigation in cassava at 100% of cumulative pan evaporation (CPE) resulted in 400% increase in tuber yield of cassava (44 tonnes/ha) compared to rainfed crop (11 tonnes/ha) in summer. Drip irrigation resulted in 30% increase in tuber yield (44 tonnes/ha) as well as 50% saving in water consumption compared to surface irrigation (32 tonnes/ ha). The water productivity and water requirement of cassava was estimated to be 8.2 kg/m3 and 3 mm/day, respectively. Based on QUEFTS (Quantitative Evaluation of Fertility of Tropical Soils) model, customized fertilizer formulations for cassava and sweet potato were developed and validated at 35 farmers’ fields in Kerala and seven farmers’ fields in Odisha. The customized fertilizer treatment (51.2 tonnes/ha) resulted in 24% higher yield over farmers’ fertilizer practice (41.3 tonnes/ha) in cassava in Kerala and at par with farmers’ practice in sweet potato (11.5 tonnes/ha) in Odisha. Spices: Insect-proof net covered walk-in-tunnel gave maximum seed yield of 22.7, 25.4 and 8.2 q/ha in fennel, dill and cumin, whereas plastic sheet covered walk in tunnel gave maximum seed yield of 28.73 q/ ha in fenugreek. Vertical walls of plastic sheet were also effective to reduce the frost damage and improve seed yield of coriander (18.73 q/ha) and fenugreek (30.32 q/ha). The green and black shaded net were more effective for off-season leafy coriander and fenugreek production than white and red shaded nets during June and July. About 90% shading intensity of green shaded net or 75% black shaded nets were equally effective for higher leafy biomass production in off-season for both coriander and fenugreek.
