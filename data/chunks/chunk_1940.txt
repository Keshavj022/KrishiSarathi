 The squared exponential is the widely used kernel function for retrieving crop traits from multispectral and hyperspectral datasets. The best prediction performance for GPR models can be achieved by integrating with radiative transfer models. This hybrid modeling approach with the aid of dimensionality reduction and active learning techniques demonstrated accurate retrieval of multiple cropland traits using satellite and UAV-borne datasets (Sahoo et al. 2023b).

The simulated spectral data from the RT modelling is used for training the GPR model. Several active learning methods were also used for reducing the training size of model, making it lighter to integrate with online platforms such as Google Earth Engine to generate accurate maps of multiple crop traits of larger areas (Sahoo et al. 2023b). AI and IoT in Agriculture The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly revolutionized the agricultural sector, offering a multitude of benefits that enhance efficiency, sustainability, and productivity. One key advantage lies in precision agriculture, where AI-driven analytics and IoT devices collaborate to optimize various aspects of farming operations. Real-time monitoring of soil conditions, crop health, and weather patterns enables farmers to make informed decisions, enhancing crop yield and resource utilization. Applications of AI/ ML in Agriculture Some of the AI/ ML based applications in agriculture sector are- â€¢ Yield prediction: Several machine learning models were used to support crop yield estimation using remote sensing data. As per a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) conducted by van Klompenburg et al. in 2020, the most applied ML algorithm is Artificial Neural Networks and the deep learning model is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The outperformance of other ML models like Bayesian regularization BP (back propagation) neural network, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Extreme Learning Regression (ELR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) were also observed for estimating the crop yield using UAV and satellite remote sensing data (Kumar et al. 2023; Maimaitijiang et al. 2021; Xu et al. 2021).
