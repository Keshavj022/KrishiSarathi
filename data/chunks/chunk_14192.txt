 However, in the Indian context, the current agri- cultural drought assessment scenario has been dependent on hydro- meteorological variables or vegetation-based drought indices. The ex- amples of extensively used indices include: Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI, Nikam et al., 2020; Sandeep et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2021; Roy et al., 2023); Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI, Kannan and Govindasamy, 2022; Roy et al., 2023); Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, Yaduvanshi et al., 2015; Das et al., 2019; Vyas and Bhattacharya, 2020, Latha, 2021; Sandeep et al., 2021) and Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI, Patel et al., 2012). These indices assess vegetation health and water stress by analysing the relationship between vegetation status and surface temperature. While NDVI is effective for monitoring vegetation conditions, environmental factors can produce vegetation anomalies that mimic drought, making it challenging to distinguish drought-affected areas based solely on NDVI (Sivakumar et al., 2011; Martínez-Fern´andez et al., 2016). Additionally, interactions between soil, vegetation, and atmosphere can be decoupled, complicating the interpretation of vegetation indices (Martínez- Fern´andez et al., 2016). SM on the other hand is a direct indicator of the water availability in the soil, which is critical for crop growth (Mishra and Singh, 2010). While SM-based indices may not directly measure water demand, they are effective in assessing the SM deficits that impact crop growth. These indices rely on the implicit understanding that the * Corresponding author. E-mail address: manalipal000@gmail.com (M. Pal).

By capturing SM levels, these indices pro- vide an indirect measure of crop water stress. Therefore, although they may not quantify the exact water demand of crops, their application in agricultural drought assessment remains valuable, as they help identify areas where crops are likely experiencing water deficits. For these rea- sons, a direct approach using SM data could be more effective, and SM- based indices are generally more reliable for evaluating agricultural droughts (Tirivarombo et al., 2018). Keeping in mind, the necessity of SM information in agricultural drought studies, there are some SM-based indices in use.
