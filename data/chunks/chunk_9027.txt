 Five varieties/hybrids of orchids (Dendrobium group); 14 varieties of Anthurium; 23 types/varieties of foliage plants from 26 genera and 10 types/varieties of flowering plants from 13 genera were introduced from mainland. Of the six varieties of gladiolus evaluated, Dhiraj produced the maximum number of spikes/corm (3.15) with maximum florets opened at a time (5.82 florets), and had maximum vase life (7.5 days). Tilak gladiolus had the maximum florets/spike (11.5) and bigger flower size (9.14 cm). ● In-vitro flowering and fruiting induced in tomato from calli generated from leaf explants in Pant 11 ● In orchids 10 species collected and catalogued ● Varieties/hybrids/types introduced from mainland: 5 of orchids (Dendrobium group), 14 of Anthurium, 23 of foliage plants, 10 of flowering plants Tilak, a variety of gladiolus produces, 11.5 florets/ spike and bigger size flowers (9.14 cm) In-vitro flowering and fruiting were induced in tomato from calli regenerated from leaf explants of Pant 11 RESEARCH FOR TRIBAL AND HILL REGIONS 185 Plantation Crops Among the indigenous germplasm collection of coconut, KD 8-113 gave the maximum yield (74 nuts/palm/year), followed by KD 27-72 (70). In arecanut, highest yield (328 nuts/palm/year) was obtained in Samruddhi, followed by Calicut 31 (207). In arecanut garden (0.4 ha), yield of 157,300 arecanuts, 10 kg of black pepper and 14.10 kg of cinnamon was obtained. In this intercropping, gross returns of Rs 56,000 and net returns of 41,000 were realized. Natural Resource Management In an acid soil in basin of oilpalm plantation, application of rockphosphate in combination with fresh poultry manure and farmyard manure to soils with earthworms significantly increased Bray-P (available P), P fractions and enzyme activity in soils and casts. The relative erosion potential of soils of Andamans and site suitability of soils of various islands for growing coconut, arecanut, tree spices and black pepper were determined and mapped. Animal Sciences Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) is a recent introduction in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. An inter-species hybrid ‘Quicken’ was developed between Nicobari fowl and Japanese quail. The strain, Lactobacillus acidophilus N.C.D.C 014 was found to be more efficient, in augmenting the growth rate in Japanese quails in hot humid tropics of these Islands, than other strains of Lactobacillus and may be included in feed as a probiotic supplement. Fisheries Grouper is an important seafood species in Andaman. A total of 31 species of grouper were recorded, of which the most abundant species was Epinephelus areolatus, constituting 25% of the catch. The breeding and larval rearing in Macrobrachium rosenbergii resulted in harvest of 8,000 post larvae in three successive batches for stocking in the experimental ponds. Polyculture experiment of M. rosenbergii with other Indian major carps, i.e. Labeo rohita and Catla catla, in a 0.08 ha pond showed production of 546.
