 Mora is of variable size and it is suited for paddy seeds as it has capacity of storing up to quintals of seeds, and earthen pots are generally of medium capacity and hence, it is suited for storing about 10 kg seeds in single container.

The results obtained indicate the following: Seed germination: The percent seed germinated was found maximum in potam than in other storage structures/methods for all the three seeds, viz, lobia, bittergourd and lady's finger. For storage of lobia seeds the order of efficient storage structure is potam>earthen pitcher> dermi> muslin cloth (control). For seeds of bitter gourd, the order was potam>sticking with wall> dermi > muslin cloth (control). For seeds of lady's finger, the order is potam> seeka >dermi >muslin cloth (control). Insect infestation: The un-germinated seeds were categorised for possible reasons for not germination. The efficiency of different structures/ methods was in the order of potam>dermi> control (muslin cloth) > earthen pitcher for lobia, potam> sticking with wall> dermi> muslin cloth for bitter gourd and potam> seeka>dermi>muslin cloth for lady's finger.
