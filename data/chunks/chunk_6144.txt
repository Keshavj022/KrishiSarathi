 spontaneum in farmers' field June. Seedlings were raised in the nursery with all the recommended agronomic practices to obtain healthy seedlings. Thirty-day old seedlings were transplanted on 25-28 July in randomized block design (RBD), each treatment in 4 replications with 40 m2area for each microplot (replication). Fertilizer application was made @ 60 N:30 P:30 K kg/ha. Half the dose was applied basal, whereas the rest was applied in two split doses, one at the tillering and the other at panicle-initiation stage. First and second treatments of wild sugarcane were made at the scheduled period. Source of availability of wild sugarcane was found out within 60 km periphery of CRRI. Observations on percentage of hill infestation and yield of rice were taken. The variety used was Moti. In farmers' fields three treatments were used: planting of S. spontaneum at insect infestation, insecticide treatment, and untreated control. Each farmer represented one replication with three plots as three treatments. Each plot size was within the range of 600-800 m2 with 10 replications. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Results of the experiments conducted during 2002 at CRRI research station showed that planting of wild sugarcane at 5 DAT was more effective than the other treatments. Incidence of caseworm was not observed on 20 DAT due to planting of wild sugarcane at 7 DAT and 14 DAT, Fig. 2. Spider on stem of S. spontaneum and with application of imidacloprid. Planting of wild sugarcane before infestation by caseworm helped obtain rice yield of 63.2 to 64 q/ha, which was 68 q/ha when insecticide was applied. Untreated plot gave the lowest yield (51.7 q/ha). Substantial reduction in incidence of case-worm was noticed in the experiments conducted at farmers' fields. Observations at farmers' fields further showed reduction of pest population towards 10th day of botanical treatment, and total control was observed after 20th and 30th day of treatment (Tables 1 and 2). No hills were lost by insect infestation in wild sugarcane treatment, whereas there was complete damage of 30 to 45% hills in untreated control plots. In addition, delayed flowering was observed with reduced Table 1.
