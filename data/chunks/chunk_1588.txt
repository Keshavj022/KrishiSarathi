 Effective practices include capturing rainwater, managing water resources with dams and tanks, and minimizing losses through efficient crop and soil management. Land levelling with a gentle slope of 1-2% reduces runoff and improves water efficiency. Contour bunding and trenching trap the soil particles carried along with runoff, thus aiding soil infiltration and replenishment of soil moisture. Making terraces on slopes of 8% conserves soil and water while reducing the slope. Additional practices, such as contour cultivation, stabilized drains, strip cropping, seasonal land fallowing, mixed cropping, and mulch application, further support the soil and water conservation. By adopting these techniques, farmers in the Eastern Himalayan region can establish a sustainable agricultural framework, ensuring long-term productivity and environmental health. Strengthening water harvesting capacity and irrigation infrastructure: The North Eastern Region (NER) of India has approximately 34% of the countryâ€™s water resources, yet only 0.85 million hectares land are irrigated, far below its potential of 4.26 million hectares. The region faces unique water dynamics, experiencing heavy rainfall in monsoon season followed by severe shortages in pre- and post-monsoon periods. To address these challenges, promoting rainwater harvesting Indian Farming 92 January 2025 (RWH) and efficient water management is essential. RWH can reduce reliance on groundwater and enhance irrigation capabilities. In hilly areas, RWH structures not only mitigate floods but also provide irrigation and drinking water during dry spells. Constructing low-cost polylined tanks allows for effective water collection and storage, facilitating gravity-fed flow or small pump use. Traditional practices, such as jalkund (30,000 L polylined tanks) and farm ponds, have proven to be successful in conserving rainwater and creating livelihood opportunities. Additionally, adopting micro-irrigation methods like drip and sprinkler irrigation will improve water productivity and resource efficiency in the region. Agroforestry measures: The hilly landscapes face significant biotic pressures from factors like shifting cultivation, deforestation, and commercial exploitation, thus making the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices essential. Agroforestry offers a solution by enhancing the crop production while addressing challenges like soil erosion and timber shortages. It mitigates erosion through improved canopy coverage, providing surface litter, and root binding, improving the soil properties. While hilly terrain limits individual adoption, community lands and wastelands can be used for cultivating multipurpose trees, aiding slope management and erosion control.
