It grows well where rainfall ranges from 500 to 700 mm and where rains fall during summer. Foxtail millet grows better between 16 and 26°C though it can tolerate up to 35°C. It can grow on sandy to heavy clay soils (except saline soils) but requires fairly fertile soils for good yields. Light soils including red loams, alluvials and black cotton soils are suitable for its cultivation. The recommended package of practices are given in Table 2. Table 2.
