   Because of lack of irrigation, most of the farmers are not able to take up intensive protected cultivation of high value cash crops (vegetables, fruits and flowers).   Except sheep and goats, which are largely owned by the nomads, animal husbandry, poultry and fisheries have not been taken up commercially.   Lack of transport and marketing facilities and lack of storage, processing and value addition are the major bottlenecks in turning farming into an economically viable enterprise.   Cultivation of temperate fruits has made a huge impact in the mid and high-hill regions of Himachal Pradesh. However, fruit cultivation has not been taken up on a commercial scale in the lower Shivalik Hills, which accounts for nearly 60% of the total area and population. There is a need for a mission mode approach to double the farm income by focusing on critical inputs for doubling the farmers’ income. To achieve this objective, it is imperative that we overcome the major constraints to increasing crop production such as shortage of irrigation facilities and farm roads, improve input use efficiency, adopt integrated crop – livestock farming and develop facilities for marketing the farm produce. To realize a major boost in farmers’ income, it is equally important that we invest in developing newer technologies and innovations, as well as increase the collaboration between different departments of the central and state governments, and promote public – private partnerships in agri-food system. The following interventions can be made to double the farmer’s income in Himachal Pradesh over the next 5 years.   Strengthening of water storage structures, and efficient management of rain water harvesting.   Promoting timely and judicious use of fertilizers based on soil and water testing reports.   Adoption of cluster approach for holistic development of vegetables, fruits, flowers, and spices.   Timely availability of quality seeds/ seedlings of vegetables and fruits.   Promotion of high density plantations in fruits.   Efficient and timely use of integrated pest management practices.   Enacting legislative measures for protection of crops from wild animals. 10.2 Zones- Wise Strategies for doubling of farmers’ income A. Shivalik Hill Zone Strategy 1: Productivity Enhancement i. Strengthening of traditional water storage structure ii. Creation of additional water storage in valley and low hills for lean season. State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 196 iii. Promotion of water conservation techniques like mulch, sprinkler and drip in juvenile plants in low or valley areas. iv. Adoption of cluster approach for holistic development v. Timely and local availability of high yielding varieties of all the cereal, pulse, High Value Crops like vegetable, fruits, spices, etc. vi. Efficient management of rain water harvesting vii. Cultivation of fodder crops & medicinal crops viii. Efficient and timely use of IPM and IDM practices ix.
