In this regard, millets provide a great opportunity due to their hardy and climate resilient nature. They can be an alternative option to replace the conventional crops in the dry and marginal areas. In addition to their climate resilience, millets are also rich in several vital micronutrients and vitamins necessary for reducing malnutrition and provide multiple health benefits. The national genebank at ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi and ICAR-IIMR, Hyderabad, Telangana conserves approximately one lakh accessions of millet germplasms which can be of great use in the identification and development of improved millet cultivars. This article enlists the status of millet genetic resource management which combines the activities such as collection, conservation, evaluation, documentation and distribution of the millets genetic resources to the users (researchers). Keywords: Genetic resources, Germplasm, Millets I CAR-Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR), Hyderabad, Telangana is one of the National Active Germplasm Sites (NAGS) with the responsibility to collect, conserve, evaluate, document and distribute the millets genetic resources to the bonafide user within the country. Collection A total of 2273 accessions collected by NRCS/DSR/ IIMR from 45 explorations and 423 accessions were collected by other individuals during 2000–2021. Indigenous collection numbers for 1928 accessions were obtained from National Genebank, ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi. All eight millets were collected during the exploration which includes sorghum (2010), pearl millet (127), finger millet (244), foxtail millet (102), proso millet (19), barnyard millet (7), little millet (146) and kodo millet (41). Augmentation A total of 78,429 accessions received from various National and International centres includes, sorghum (52,757), finger millet (10,704), foxtail millet (5,096), pearl millet (4,973), proso millet (1,666) and barnyard millet (1,661). A total of 58,572 accessions of millets were augmented from ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi and its regional stations followed by 7,887 accessions from CGIAR-ICRISAT, Patancheru, Hyderabad. Characterization A total of 62,789 accessions of millets germplasm were characterized during 2003–2021 in which 45,092 accessions were of sorghum followed by finger millet (7,002) and pearl millet (5,395).
