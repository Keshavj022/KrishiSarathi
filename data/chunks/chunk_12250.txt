 It resembles with HD 2329, HD 2687 and PBW 343 for ear waxiness and with HD 2329 and PBW 343 in grain shape 7 Recommended productionecology (Rainfed/Irrigated; : Irrigated, timely sown conditions high/low fertility; season) 8 Specific area of its adaptation (zones and states : North Western Plains Zone [Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, for which variety is proposed) and the recommended Rajasthan (except Kota and Udaipur divisions), productionecology western Uttar Pradesh(except Jhansi division), Parts of Jammu and Kashmir (Kathua district), parts of Himachal Pradesh (Una district and Paonta Valley) and Uttarakhand (tarai region)] 9 Description of hybrid/variety : a) Plant height : 98 cm (Range:72-112) (Table 6) b) Distinguishing morphological characters : (Annexure-V) c) Maturity (range in number of days) (from seedling/ : Seed- to- seed: 143 days (127-160) (Table 6) transplanting to flowering, seed to seed) (Contd) 161 GUIDELINES FOR TESTING CROP VARIETIES UNDER AICCIPS d) Maturity group (early, medium and late wherever : Medium late (Table 6) such classification exists) e) Reaction to major diseases under field and : HD 3086 adult plant is resistant to brown rust and controlled conditions (reaction to physiological yellow. It has also shown high degree of resistance strains/ races/pathotypes/ bio-types, to be to other diseases (Tables 3, 3.1 , 3.2) indicated wherever possible ) f) Reaction to major pests (under field and controlled : No major insect- pests are reported in HD 3086 conditions including storage pests) g) Agronomic features (e.g. resistance to lodging, : HD 3086 has shown superior performance under shattering, fertilizer responsiveness, suitability timely, late and very late sown conditions of the to early or late sown conditions, seed rate etc.) North Western Plains Zone comprising Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan (except Kota and Udaipur divisions), western Uttar Pradesh(except Jhansi division), Parts of Jammu and Kashmir (Kathua district), parts of Himachal Pradesh (Una district and Paonta Valley) and Uttarakhand (tarai region) with very low reduction in grain yield and other agronomic parameters (Tables 2 ,2.1) h) Quality of produce : a) Grain quality : This variety has amber coloured grains with a very good score of grain hardness, appearance, high protein content, and hector-litre weight and sedimentation value. It has also very good chapati – making and excellent bread- making qualities (Tables 5, 5.1, 5.2 , 5.3) b) Fodder quality : — i) Reaction to stresses : HD 3086 has shown tolerance to terminal heat stress. This is indicated by the performance of the variety under timely and late and very late sown conditions in yield and other agronomic parameters.
