5 m) technology using 200 micron UV stabilized plastic film and locally available material, i.e. bamboo, was developed for raising seedlings of capsicum and tomato during winter month (January) under mid-hill conditions of N–W Himalayas. It enables advancement of production of these vegetables by one month and thereby helps fetch higher prices. The construction cost of tunnel was Rs 287.00 only. A comparison of 27 years average yield data of soybean and wheat from a long- term fertility experiment under NP and NPK treatments, showed significant response to applied potassium, resulting in 69.9% increase in average yield of soybean and 20.0% increase in residual wheat crop. Continuous application of farmyard manure (FYM) in combination with N alone or NPK to soybean crop, also showed increasing trend in productivity of both the crops. This could be attributed to addition of 55.9 kg N, 15.4 kg P, 58.5 kg K, 117.7 g Zn, 3,329.0 g Fe, 560.3 g Mn, 22.7 g Cu, 40.6 g B and 170.5 g Mo/ha from FYM to soil every year. The results of first year experiment showed advantage of organic farming over chemical fertilization. The rice crop responded well to applied organic manure and equivalent amount of NPK. With the application of 5, 10, 15 and 20 tonnes FYM/ha, the yield of VL Basmati 2 rice increased from 3,000 kg/ha to 3,805; 4,083; 4,416 VLT 9531 tomato gives 29.3 and 23.4% higher fruit yield than best checks Pusa Ruby and Rupali respectively (left); VHC 12, a promising genotype of capsicum, identified for release in Uttaranchal hills, outyielded best check California Wonder (middle); Vivek mandua/madira thresher developed at the VPKAS, Almora, for threshing and pearling grains of mandua and madira (right) Resistant lines of rice and wheat Disease Resistant line Rice Blast disease VSR 8 and VL 4049 Brown spot VSR 8, VSR 28 and VL 4015 Wheat Rusts VL 796, VL 802 and VL 803 Loose smut VL 826, VL 829 and VL 832 Karnal bunt and VL 798 hill bunt l Low-cost poly-tunnel technology developed for 1-month advance production of capsicum and tomato during winter. l In a long-term fertility experiment under NP and NPK treatments, applied P resulted yield increase of 69.9% in soybean and 20% in residual wheat. l Continuous FYM application with N alone or with NPK to soybean increased the productivity of soybean and wheat. l Organically fertilized basmati rice plots showed less blast score and stem- borer incidence than chemically fertilized ones. RESEARCH FOR TRIBAL AND HILL REGIONS 185 and 4,722 kg/ha, respectively, based on 6 m2 net plot yields. The corresponding yield of Basmati rice with chemical fertilizer (NPK) applied equivalent to 5, 10, 15 and 20 tonnes FYM/ha were 4,305; 4,694; 3,916 and 4,125 kg/ha respectively. Harvest index was higher under organic manured plots (37.6-40.9%) than inorganic fertilized plots (30.7–35.4%). Blast score (6.5) and incidence of stem-borer (9.
