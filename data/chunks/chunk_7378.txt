 KVAFSU, Bidar for Mandya Sheep; TANUVAS, Chennai for Mecheri Sheep; RAJUVAS, Bikaner for Sonadi Sheep and ICAR- CSWRI, Avikanagar for Malpura sheep with project coordinating (PC) unit at ICAR-CSWRI, Avikanagar. The major objective of the project is improvement of indigenous sheep breeds by propagation of superior germplasm in the farmers’ flock by each unit. Body weight gain and lactation performance of goats Barbari: The overall least squares means of part lactation milk yield in 90 and 140 days were 84.52±2.08 and 117.69±4.16 liters. Year of kidding had significant influence on all the lactation traits. Jamunapari: The least squares means of body weight of kids at birth, 9, and 12 month were 18.86±0.34 and 22.69±0.23 kg, respectively. Least square means for total lactation yield and lactation length were 82.46±1.13 litres and 113.61±2.13 liters, respectively. Developed database of goat milk proteins and peptides: A database of more than 2,000 proteins and peptides in milk samples collected from various tropical goat breeds was developed which would potentially be used for multiple human health benefits. Camel The PCR products (TLR 4 exon 2) were sequenced, submitted to NCBI (accession no: MT365024) and analyzed. One polymorphic SNP at the positions in 5’ UTR region of TLR4 gene was identified, whereas no SNPs were found in exons. The phylogenetic analysis was also performed. Mithun Follicular dynamics studies in pubertal mithun animals: The follicular dynamics concerning the changes in concentrations of hormones during the estrous cycle in pubertal mithun was evaluated. Pig Generation-wise genetic evaluation of Rani pig crosses: A high producing crossbred pig variety Rani was developed and released by ICAR-NRC on Pig. The breed characters of Rani crossbred was stabilized. Top 3 and 8% of male and female were selected for producing subsequent generation based on performance traits. Poultry Improvement of germplasm Rural poultry germplasm: Two male lines, PD-1 (Vanaraja male line) and PD-6 (Gramapriya male line) and two female lines, PD- 2 (Vanaraja female line) and PD-3 (Brown egg layer line) were improved. The genetic and phenotypic response to selection for higher shank length at 6th wk in PD-6 was 2.39 and 1.44 mm, respectively, over the last 9 generations. In PD-3 line (S-8), the direct selection response over the last seven generations was 151.5 g on genetic scale and 79.7 g on phenotypic scale for egg mass at 40 wks, the primary trait of selection.
