 The FLDs were conducted to popularise improved production technology of pearl millet of inclusion of improved hybrids/ populations in package of practices and evaluating improved agronomic practices as against farmers practices. ICMH 356, RHB 121, RHB 90, Raj 171, HHB 67, ICTP 8203, CZP 9802 & Pusa 605 in Rajasthan, GHB 558 in Gujarat, PPC 6 in Maharashtra, HHB 94 in Haryana, JBV 3 in Madhya Pradesh, 9330, 9444 & 7688 in Uttar Pradesh, ICTP 8203, ICMV 221 & Mahalaxmi Seed in Maharashtra, COH(Cu)8 & Co7 in Tamil Nadu alongwith recommended package of practices considerably increased grain yield of pearl millet over the prevalent hybrids/ varieties in the states. Basal application of nitrogen increased grain yield by 20.14 per cent over no basal application in Sikar district of Rajasthan. The increases in grain yield by 53.85 and 7.0 per cent through herbicidal control and biofertlization were demonstrated in Rajasthan. Wider row spacing of 60 cm increased grain yield by 70.21 per cent over closer row spacing of 30 cm. Intercropping of pearl millet with clusterbean and mothbean in Rajasthan moong bean and clusterbean in Haryana and pigeonpea in South India were found beneficial as compared to sole pearl millet. • Frontline demonstrations under integrated cereal development programme were conducted at Jamnagar and Coimbatore center in late rabi 2004 and kharif 2005. In 40 frontline demonstration conducted at Jamnagar revealed that improved practices gave 14.34 and 10.72 per cent higher grain and fodder yield than farmers practices. In kharif 2005 at Coimbatore, in comparison to local cultivars, Co(Cu)9 gave 31.30, 17.54 and 47.35 per cent higher grain fodder and net return respectively. 3. Crop Protection – Drought Evaluation of hybrids or varieties for their response to terminal drought stress, the following pearl millet material is found tolerant to terminal drought in kharif 2005. www.icar.org.in 66 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science Material Drought tolerance Hybrid(s) MH 1234 (GHB 715), MH 1307, MH 1272 Variety(ies) Raj 171, MP 445 GHB 538, GHB 715 & GHB 720 among hybrids, 841A & 88004A among MS lines, and J 2244 and J 2405 among inbred at Jamnagar, while at Jaipur, 93333A x 191‐200S/ 05, 843A x 14‐15 S/04 and 843A x 20‐24 S/04 among hybrids, and 14‐15 S/04 and 20‐24 S/04 among parents performed better for seedling establishment. 4. Management of diseases 2002‐03 • Eighty seven hybrids and varieties in initial trial and 51 advance hybrids and varieties were screened in downy mildew sick plot nursery and for smut under artificial inoculation conditions. Seventeen hybrids and two varieties in zone A and 30 hybrids and one variety in zone B showed highly resistant (<1%) reaction to downy mildew disease. Hybrid MH 1021(GHB577) showed complete resistance (0.0%) in zone A and highly resistant reaction (0.5%) in zone B.
