During survey, a bio-control parasitizing Rhizoctonia solani of maize causing banded leaf and sheath blight disease under field conditions was observed and collected from Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Kafligair, Bageshwar, Uttarakhand (29.75°N 79.74°E, 1,275 m amsl). Under microscopic observations, conidiophore bearing conidia were observed. Conidiophores were repeatedly branched, irregularly verticillate, bearing clusters of divergent, often irregularly bent, flask-shaped phialides.
