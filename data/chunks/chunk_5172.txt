 A thick layer of this paste was thoroughly applied over the fractured part or limb and covered tightly withseveral layers of cloth bandages and cotton. A number of small wooden or bamboo splints were also applied over it with cloth bandages. (xiv) Other treatments used concurrently: Nil (xv) Any post - treatment precautions: Restricted activity till complete fracture healing. (xvi) Time of removal of this coaptation: Varying from 2 to 4 months. (xvii) Status of animal’s locomotion after removal of coaptation : Mostly satisfactory. (xviii) Complications: The people were asked about the occurrence of various complications such as haemorrhage, pus formation, excessive inflammation or oedema of the dependent part, loosening of assembly, progressive deterioration of gait, angulation of limbetc. The premature loosening of coaptation, inflammation or oedema of the dependent part and large callus formation were recorded in a few cases. On the basis of above feedback, it was presumed that this plant may have some fracture- healing-supporting capabilities, which need to be further investigated by scientific methods. Experiment Clinical observations The rectal temperature, respiration rate and  VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY heart rate in the animals of both the groups remained within the normal range and did not show any significant change during entire course of study (Tables 1, 2 and 3). Feed intake was also normal in all the animals of both groups throughout the period of study. The animal of Haematological observations No significant change was observed in the haematological parameters throughout the period of study in all the animals of both the groups (Tables 5, 6, 7 and 8). Although manu-treated group showed slight neutrophilia from day 0 onwards to day 30 after operation but the increase was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Biochemical observations Calcium level in blood increased from day 0 to day 3, declined continuously thereafter and manu- treated group showed greater pain and inflammation in the immediate postoperative days up to day 15. However, in general they started early complete weight bearing on the affected limb from day 35 onwards as compared to control group (Table 4). Table 2.
