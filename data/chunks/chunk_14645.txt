 The strains showed differ- ential growth patterns on different ISP media. Six strains viz., S. daghestanicus TN6, S. araujoniae TN14, N. ﬂavescens TN14, S.bo- haiensis TN17, S. griseus TN27 and N. dassonvillei TN33 were char- acterized as showing good growth in all the four ISP media. Twenty-one strains were characterized as showing good growth in atleast three ISP media while seventeen strains showed good growth in atleast two ISP media. Pigment production was observed in twenty strains in atleast one media. S. zhihengii TN 36 produced pigment on all four ISP media and S. araujoniae TN19 produced pig- ments on three ISP media while the strains S. araujoniae TN11, S. araunoniae TN14 and S. anulatus TN55 produced pigments on atleast two ISP media. The Media ISP-3 facilitated the production of pigment by 18 strains TN1, TN3, TN6, TN8, TN9, T11, TN13, TN14, TN16, TN17, TN19, TN28, TN31, TN35, TN38, TN55, TN63, and TN66; Six strains which include TN1, TN8, TN9, TN11, TN19, and TN28, exhibit pigment formation on ISP-1 media. Five strains showed pigmentation on ISP-4 media which includes TN4, TN5, TN9, TN14, and TN19 while ISP-7 facilitated pigment formation by only one strain (TN9). The colour of aerial and substrate myce- lium of all the 65 actinomycetes strains was also recorded which includes white, brown, pale green, pale yellow, yellow, grey, greenish-yellow, light green, green, light yellow and dark green. 3.6. Antifungal activity of actinomycetes strains Antifungal activities of all the 65 actinomycetes strains against four fungal strains, F. udum, F. oxysporum f.sp. ciceris, M. phaseolina and S. rolfsii. are represented in Table 3. All 65 strains showed anti- fungal activity against F. udum with inhibition ranging from 1.96 to 63.99 %. S. daghestanicus TN3, N. dassonvillei TN12 and S. araujoniae TN19 showed maximum inhibition with respective inhibition per- centages of 63.99, 63.96 and 63.96. Twenty strains showed more than 50 % inhibition against F. udum. Similarly, all the strains exhibited antifungal activity against F. oxysporum f.sp. ciceris with inhibition ranging from 1.79 to 63.81 %. Nine strains showed more than 50 % inhibition against F. oxysporum while strains S. araujoniae TN11 and S. daghestanicus TN3 showed maximum inhibition with a percent inhibition of 63.81 and 61.33, respectively. Out of 65 strains, 48 showed the ability to inhibit Macrophomina phaseolina on plates with inhibitions ranging from 3.75 to 82.50 %. Twenty strains in the study have shown inhibition percent of 70 and above against M. phaseolina while strains S. rochei TN56, N. ﬂavescens TN49 and S. daghestanicus TN 66 showed maximum inhibitions with percent inhibitions of 82.50, 81.67 and 79.17 respectively. Against S. rolfsii 39 strains showed inhibition and inhibition per- cent was recorded between 3.33 and 52.50. Only three strains viz., S. araujoniae TN11, S. araujoniae TN19 and S. griseus TN27 showed more than 40 % inhibition.
