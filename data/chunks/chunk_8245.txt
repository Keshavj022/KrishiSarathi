 Bioassay against H. armigera identified promising transgenic lines with 80-100% mortality. In T3 generation, eight stably integrated events with 80- 100 % insect mortality and high cry1AcF expression were identified. Four events had T-DNA integrated as a single copy. Ten stably integrated events with high cry2Aa expression demonstrated 80-100% insect mortality. Snapshot of molecular and bioefficacy analysis of the pigeonpea transgenics harbouring cry1AcF and cry2Aa important cloned rice genes and 117 multi-copy rice genes. A total of 320 wild rice accessions were genotyped by 50K SNP chip. Assays with this chip showed high success rate and reproducibility. Cereals Cloning of RuBisCo activase gene: The gene was cloned from heat-tolerant wheat cultivar HD 2985 for basic studies for improving stress tolerance in wheat to mitigate effects of climate change. Sucrose synthase locus LOC_Os2g58480 identified: This was identified as polymorphic in two mapping populations, viz. Rasi/ Vibhava and BPT5204/ PTB1. Mapping of leaf-rust resistant gene in wheat: A novel alien leaf-rust resistance gene (Lr Sel.G12) was mapped to chromosome 3BL and linked to two microsatellite markers Xgwm114 and Xgwm547 in Triticum timopheevii derivative, ‘Selection G12’. Oilseeds Identification of associated markers for late leaf spot in groundnut: Twenty new polymorphic SSR markers were identified for genotyping of mapping population of GJG 17 × GPBD 4. Three new SSR markers — DGR 308, DGR 508 and DGR 800— were associated with late leaf spot (LLS) disease resistance in groundnut. Cost-effective SNP genotyping in castor: This assay based on ‘Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR genotyping system (KASP)’, a fluorescent endpoint genotyping technology of LGC Genomics, was developed for 300 SNP loci in castor. The assays were validated in a panel of 13 inbred lines consisting of parents of mapping population and breeding lines with grey-mould resistance. The genotyping data quality was high with 100% reproducibility among replicates. The alternate alleles of the SNP locus and heterozygotes could be Distribution of different kinds of rice genes and number of SNPs in the affymetrix 50K rice SNP chip (OsSNPnks): (a) number of genes in different categories; (b) number of SNPs in different categories of genes; (c) number of SNPs in different regions of genes CROP IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 51 Transferability of rice EST-derived microsatellite markers to Dichanthium annulatum A total of 80 SSR markers developed from stress responsive ESTs of rice were evaluated for transferability in Dichanthium annulatum. Upon initial screening of SSR markers in two genotypes of marvel grass, 50 rice SSR primer pairs (62.5%) and 33 (41.25%) primer pairs found transferable, which produced clear and consistent amplified products, were checked for transferability in 25 D. annulatum genotypes.
