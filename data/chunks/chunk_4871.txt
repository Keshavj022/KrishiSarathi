 Machine learning algorithms analyze environmental data to continuously adjust these factors, ensuring that each plant receives optimal conditions for growth. For instance, AI systems can increase light exposure during low-sunlight days or reduce humidity levels to prevent fungal outbreaks. Automation and robotics: AI-driven automation and robotics are transforming cultural practices under protected cultivation. With capabilities like autonomous planting and harvesting, as well as intelligent sorting and packaging, AI-powered machines can perform repetitive tasks with accuracy and efficiency resulting in reduced labour costs and enhancing productivity. Indoor vertical farming ICAR-Indian Institute of Horticultural Research, Bengaluru designed and developed an indoor crop growing system with vertical farming approach. The plants were grown in plastic plant containers which were placed on mild steel strucutres. The structure was a two- tier system with 450 mm distance between these tiers for convenient crop mangement. Light-emitting diode (LED) lights were used as light source. Lettuce seedlings were transplanted to plastic plant containers filled with Arka Fermented Cocopeat and crop was raised with recommended nutrient (Arka Sasya Poshak Ras) schedule. The experimental results gave encouraging crop growth. Further, the experiment has the AI application in terms of irrigation, fertilizer application, crop protection, micro- climate data recording and photoperiod control data through temperature, relative humidity, light, chlorophyll meter sensors, etc. Protected cultivation (Optimizing controlled environments) Protected cultivation, which includes the use of greenhouses, polyhouses, and net houses, allows for controlled environmental conditions that can shield crops from external threats such as extreme weather, pests, and diseases. However, managing these environments effectively require sophisticated monitoring and control systems. AI technologies in protected cultivation optimize the use of resources and ensure that plants thrive better under controlled conditions. Key AI modules Precise environmental control: In greenhouses and polyhouses, temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and light exposure must be precisely regulated to create ideal conditions for crop growth. AI-based systems equipped with sensors monitor these environmental parameters and use predictive algorithms to adjust climate control systems (heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting). By analyzing weather forecasts and real-time sensor data, AI modules can predict how external conditions will impact the greenhouse environment and adjust accordingly thus maintaining optimal growing conditions. This ensures efficient energy use while maintaining high productivity levels. AI-driven disease and pest detection: AI-enabled computer vision systems can identify early signs of pests and diseases in crops.
