 The results of matrix scoring done by 30 key informants on five criteria for five aspects of the technology are given in Table 2. The key informants gave maximum score to Treatment 3, indicating that when cloves are put with sugar in loose container, the extent of protection from ants during summer, rainy and winter seasons was maximum. It was also found that the extent of protection of sugar from ants was maximum when it is placed in kitchen and store. The difference between treatments in respect of all the criteria was significant. Field experiment Phase I Sugar: Experiments were conducted during  GRAIN/ SEED STORAGE September 2002 with 20 replications to study the effect of clove on presence of ants in sugar. Results obtained are presented in Table 3. It is observed that in the sugar where cloves Table 2.

Further, critical observation of a few cases in Buduan indicated that the sugar under control treatment became moist, whereas the sugar where cloves were placed remained dry. This was Table 3.

This is irrespective of the number of cloves placed in the sugar. But Table 4.

This indicates that cloves also absorb moisture and help in keeping the sugar dry. Sugar products: Burfee sweet was used in case of sugar product for experimentation. Burfee (1kg) was placed in loose open plastic containers at 10 places with three treatments, viz. control or without cloves; with 20 cloves; and with 30 cloves. The experiment was conducted in September.
