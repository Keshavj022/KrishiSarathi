 Chewing tobacco Abirami grown in Tamil Nadu, and HDBRG tobacco cultivated in Andhra Pradesh contain 3.20% solanesol. Germplasm lines T1-163 and T1-1112 with a solanesol content of 2.50% have been identified. A process, developed for extraction of solanesol (95%) with an overall recovery of 72%, has been developed. Addition of reactive linkers to solanesol have helped in hooking functional groups, amines, phenols and alcohols, paving the way for new bioactive compounds. Flue-cured CY 79 has been identified for southern light soils and southern black soils of Andhra Pradesh with conserved soil-moisture ● ●● ●● Flue-cured tobacco K 326 (NLS 4) produces semi-flavoured, suitable for export, tobacco. ● Developed interspecific hybrids for the first time from a trispecific cross (Nicotiana benthamiana - repanda) x N. gossei. ● In tobacco, damping off could be controlled to the extent of 91.4% with polythene mulching of nursery beds for 4 weeks and soil amendments with neem cake at 0.2%. ● Carcinogenic tobacco specific nitrosamines were below detectable limits in tobacco K 326, Bhavya and Ratna in Karnataka light soils. ● Solanesol, a trisesquiterpenoid alcohol from tobacco, is the starter for anti- cancer drug potentiating agents like N- solanesyl-N, N1-bis ethylene diamine. Chewing tobacco Abirami (HV 86-5) has been identified for north Bengal, Tamil Nadu and north Bihar CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 41 At Nipani, Napropamide at 1.24 and 1.50 a.i. kg/ha gave significantly higher transplantable seedlings than other treatments. At Anand, Stomp 1.5% in combination with urea (2%) controlled suckers effectively, and thereby increased the yield of bidi tobacco. Tobacco-groundnut (summer) system realized maximum net returns, followed by castor-groundnut (summer) and cotton-groundnut at the BTRS, Anand. Crop Protection On FCV tobacco, spray of Profenofos (0.15%), followed by Leufenuron (0.005%) or Ha NPV (250 LE/ha) or Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (1.5 kg/ha) was effective in managing Helicoverpa armigera. Score 10% WP (Difenconazole) effectively controlled anthracnose and frog- eye-spot in tobacco nurseries. Polythene mulching of nursery beds for 4 weeks and soil amendment with neem- cake at 0.2% controlled damping-off disease to an extent of 91.4% at the Regional Research Station, Shimoga. At Anand, soil solarization with clear LLDPE plastic film (25mm) for 15 days during summer, followed by Metalaxyl MZ at 2.16 kg/ha (Ridomil MZ 72 WP at 3 kg/ha) at initiation of damping-off, followed by Bordeaux mixture at 0.6% (ICBR 1:4.25), showed promise. Tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNA) are considered carcinogenic in tobacco. The levels are below the detectable limits in Karnataka light soils in K 326 (NLS 4), Bhavya and Ratna (1 CH6534). SEED PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY BREEDER SEED PRODUCTION During 2000-2001, a total of 2,379.32 tonnes of breeder seed of different crops have been produced. Major quantities belonged to cereals (954.
