Minimums Support Price: 1.9 The Governmentâ€™s price policy for major agricultural commodities seeks to ensure remunerative prices to the growers for their produce with a view to encouraging higher investment and production and to safeguard the interest of consumers by making available supplies at reasonable prices. Towards this end, the Government announces Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for twenty three (23) mandated crops based on the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP) after considering the views of concerned State Governments and Central Ministries/ Departments. The 23 mandated crops include 15 Kharif crops viz. paddy, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, tur (arhar), moong, urad, groundnut, soybean (yellow), sunflower seed, sesamum, nigerseed, cotton, sugarcane and 6 Rabi crops viz. wheat, barley, gram, masur (lentil), rapeseed/mustard, safflower and two commercial crops viz. jute and copra. In addition to that, MSP for toria and de-husked coconut are also fixed on the basis of MSPs of rapeseed & mustard and copra respectively. 1.9.1 On 1st June, 2020, the Government has announced the increase in MSP for Kharif Crops for marketing season 2020-21.

The expected returns to farmers over their cost of production are estimated to be highest in case of bajra (83%) followed by urad (64%), tur (58%) and maize (53%). For rest of the crops, return to farmers over their cost of production is estimated to be at least 50%. 1.9.
