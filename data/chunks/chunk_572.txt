 The stagnation temperature recording of the empty solar cooker was started at 10:00 AM. The insulation sheet temperature increased up to 100°C within half an hour and stagnated at about 140°C at around 1:00 PM. Based on temperature recordings, the values of first figure of merit (F1), second figure of merit (F2), and standardized cooking power (Ps) estimated were 0.120, 0.424, and 45W, respectively which categorized the cooker as class ‘A’. The overall efficiency of the animal-feed solar cooker was 26.5% (Table 1). The performance of the cooker was excellent during summer, however with the aid of a reflector mirror its efficiency can be improved for winter months also. Table 1. Performance indicators of animal feed solar cooker Particular Value Ambient temperature 37.0oC Inside temperature without reflector 92.4oC Inside temperature with reflector 107.6oC Stagnation temperature 140oC First figure of merit (F1) 0.120 Second figure of merit (F2) 0.424 Standardized cooking power (Ps) 45 W Overall efficiency 26.5% Advantage and economics As estimated (Table 2), the animal feed solar cooker with improved design is easy to fabricate at village Improved low-cost animal feed solar cooker designed by CAZRI, Jodhpur Indian Farming 25 August 2023 level at a cost of about `9000/unit to boil around 10 kg of feed for 4-5 animals (Table 3). Boiling animal feed through solar cooker saves around 1.0 tonne (3 kg/day) of firewood costing about `2000. Besides its easy operation, it saves around 2 hours daily which amounts to 91 man- days a year. Animal feed boiling is done mostly by farm-women, thus in saved time they can contribute significantly to family care or other agricultural operations. Meanwhile, due to avoidance of exposure to smoke, the health status of farm- women can also be improved, if used on a regular basis. Moreover, the use of the solar cooker for animal feed would replace the firewood (~1000 kg/year) which amounts to a reduction of 1442.64 kg CO2/ year to the environment (Table 3). Conservation of firewood helps in preserving the ecosystem and animal dung cake could be used as manure for crop production. SUMMARY The drudgery involved, time and health issues related to boiling of animal feed with conventional fuels warrant alternative means of animal feed cooking. Considering the abundance of sunshine in most parts of India, boiling animal feed using solar energy is found as a suitable alternative. Animal feed solar cooker was designed in such a way that it is easy to fabricate at the village level with the help of a carpenter. The use of animal-feed solar cooker helps in the saving of conventional domestic fuels such as firewood, cow dung cake and agricultural waste in rural areas. The use of animal-feed solar cooker would result in saving time and drudgery of farm-women.
