 The estimates and map of food insecurity incidence are expected to deliver invaluable information to policy- analysts and decision-makers. Competency enhancement Fifty three Emeritus Scientists and 45 Emeritus Professor were supported. The aim of this programme is to complete the work in hand for its fruitful conclusion, utilize their talent in teaching specialized courses, student research guidance, developing instructional material/ textbooks including e-learning resources for use in national agricultural education programme and distance education and use their experience in addressing nationally important issues in different ICAR-institutes and SAUs. Emeritus scientist Salient achievements Crop Sciences • Out of 494 fungal isolates studied from the salt tolerant Pokkali rice variety, two endophytes– V4J (Fusarium sp) from Pokkali rice and F. oxysporum (MH511104) from I. pes-caprae imparted salinity tolerance in the salt sensitive IR-64 rice variety as there was significant enhancement in the root and shoot ratio in the plants enriched with the above endophytes. • To understand the molecular mechanism transcriptome analysis of the 10-day old IR-64 seedlings with V4J (Fusarium sp) under salinity stress (E-S+ and E+S+; E: Endophyte; S: salt stress) was carried out. A total of 46.31 million reads (9.26 GB; E+S+) and 52.17 million reads (10.43 GB; E-S+) were generated. Further, 81.50% (E+S+) and 73.25% (E-S+) HQ reads were successfully aligned to the reference genome. Alternative splicing (AS) of transcripts is a well-recognized phenomenon in plants. Using the above transcriptome data, AS events were mined and the results showed an unequivocal decrease in the number of AS events under salinity stress as influenced by the endophyte. This is the first documented evidence of an endophyte- induced alteration in the frequency of alternative splicing event in plants subjected to salinity stress. • Soil application with neem cake at seed treatment of groundnut with T. harzianum Th3 at 8 g/kg seeds + drenching with T. harzianum Th3 at 8 ml/l water at 40 days after sowing exhibited the root rot complex reduction up to 64.4% with increased yield of 3.65 t/ha at Jaipur 73.9% with biological yield of 3.56 t/ha at Banswara agro- climatic conditions. Maximum pod yield per plant of ~40–42 was observed in the combined treatment with T. harzianum Th3, M. anisopliae Ma1 and also with chemical. • The maximum disease reduction of 68.02% was ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 115 AGRICULTURAL HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPENT observed at combined application of T. harzianum Th3 + M. anisopliae Ma1+ Flonicamid and also increased yield of cumin up to 541.50 kg/ha at Banswara agro-climatic conditions. • Purified Salkathi (CR AC. 35181; IC IC0256801; INGR 17069) and Dhobanumberi (CR AC. 35184; IC0256804; INGR19005) for Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) resistance, were registered as rice donors.
