The farmers rarely provided balanced diet or general healthcare for the pigs. However, FFP successfully implemented two scientific interventions to improve pig farming in the area, viz. capacity building on scientific pig farming, and practical trainings on selection of breed, vaccination, nutrition and healthcare.
