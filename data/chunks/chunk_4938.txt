Digital citriculture holds the promise of making citrus farming more resilient and efficient. It has the potential to transform the way citrus is cultivated, with innovations that enhance productivity, sustainability and profitability. Collaborative efforts between stakeholders will be key to overcoming barriers and ensuring that the benefits of digital technology reach all citrus growers, regardless of their scale or location. The adoption of IoT, data analytics, and other digital technologies is enabling a new era of smart farming, where informed decisions drive better outcomes. As this revolution continues to unfold, the citrus industry will likely see more efficient, sustainable, and profitable farming practices, benefiting both farmers and consumers alike. Precision tree fruit farming Precision and automated production of tree fruits including citrus fruits, requires a few specific challenges in productions. Automation, particularly on selected mechanization with personal labour-force use in any of the field operations such as training, pruning, picking, selective harvesting for fresh fruit market need to be addressed. The adoption of automation technologies for tree fruits may need a techno-economic analysis, including orchard, automation (purchasing cost, operation and maintenance) as well different systems to be used to offer different information. Good irrigation planning is the core in orchard automation system. Since water is becoming critical input micro- irrigation management with fertigation system is gaining, prominence in integration with HDP. In several crops, standardization of micro-irrigation technique for better WUE and drought is already done. Integrated pest & disease management (IPDM) is another input needed for precision farmers. Monitoring of pest and disease symptoms to predict plant protection needs, could economically control the insect posts and diseases. Robotic fruit harvesting septum for traditional canopy management structure and robotic harvesting system may not work in India in many tropical fruit crops. Automation of fruit farming where automation is through integration of agricultural equipment and precision agriculture management for harvesting maximum quality fruits is desirable. A proper techno-economic analysis for crop-based for irrigation practices should be done. Major constraints Small holder farming: About 86% farm households own and operate in less than 2.0 ha of land. These small holder famers do not have enough funding for undertaking farming properly, resulting in poor crop yield and low economic return. Of late, some programme of government in the form of projects are coming up with private investment in infrastructure and banking support.
