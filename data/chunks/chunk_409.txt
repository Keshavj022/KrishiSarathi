 Despite efforts to control and prevent pig diseases in Northeast India, economic losses due to these diseases continue to be a challenge. Various diseases of economic importance in pigs Classical swine fever (CSF) Pestivirus of the Flaviviridae family causes extremely contagious Classical Swine Fever (CSF). It has many symptoms. Infected pigs may have fever, haemorrhages, lethargy, yellowish diarrhoea, vomiting, and purple skin on the ears, lower abdomen, and legs. Abortion, reproductive failure, and neurologic symptoms can occur. Control and prevention are essential, as CSF has no therapy. Protecting pigs from the disease requires a highly effective vaccine. Vaccination boosts pigs’ immune systems and reduces illness severity. Sanitary practices such as restricting farm access, quarantining new animals, and practicing appropriate hygiene and disinfection help to prevent CSF. To avoid disease transmission within the herd or to neighbouring farms, diseased animals must be quickly identified and isolated. Pig producers can limit CSF outbreaks and economic losses by vaccinating and practicing good hygiene. African swine fever (ASF) African Swine Fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects domestic and wild pigs. The causative agent of African swine fever is Asfivirus, belonging to the family Asfarviridae. After 3–7 days, infected swine develop a high Indian Farming 26 November 2023 fever of up to 42°C. Inappetence, incoordination, weakness, and death occur rapidly. Pigs who survive the early stages of the disease may show cyanosis or reddening of the ears and snout, followed by body reddening and bleeding from the nose or rectum. African swine fever also causes vomiting, dyspnea, and sow abortions. African swine fever has no specific treatment or vaccination. Therefore, control and preventative efforts focus on rigorous disease containment. Swill feeding should be restricted or stopped as it can propagate the virus. Isolating diseased or suspected pigs, avoiding contact between wild and farmed pigs, and controlling animal movement can help to contain the disease. To prevent contamination, infected carcasses should be removed and disposed of properly. postweaning pneumonic phase. Symptoms of fertile sows are stillborn, mummified, preterm, and weak-born piglets. Anorexia and agalactia in lactating sows increase preweaning mortality. Suckling piglets’ pounding breathing indicates respiratory trouble. The postweaning pneumonic phase is persistent and affects growing pigs. Pneumonia lowers daily weight gain and increases pig mortality. Other prominent symptoms are cyanotic (blue) ears, vulva, tails, abdomens, and snouts and haemorrhages on the skin of the lateral neck and limbs. New animals entering the farm should be quarantined and tested for the PRRS virus. To avoid spreading the disease, breeding stock and semen should be purchased from PRRS virus-free sources. disorders.
