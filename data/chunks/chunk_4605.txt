 The leaves of herb are oblanceolate, relatively thick, succulent and arranged oppositely on the stem/stolon. At the same time larger leaf size or leaf area (ranging from 0.57-0.81 cm2) was observed in DBM-5 and DBM-2. However, DBM-10 had a very tiny leaf size (0.39- 0.46 cm2). Small, actinomorphic flowers are borne in leaf axils, which are whitish, blue to medium purple in colour with various sizes of flower-stalk length. At the same time elite accession DBM-9 exhibited maximum stolon length (95-122 cm). Variation was observed in flower pedicel length and pedicle diameter. Higher pedicel length (1.57 cm) and pedicel diameter (0.52-0.91 m) was exhibited by Variation in leaf shape/twisting and pedicel length of jal brahmi accessions Mayâ€“June 2021 15 DBM-4. Flower colour was purple to purplish white in most of the genotype but whitish purple flower colour was also observed. Table 1. Jal brahmi accessions with distinct morphological characters Accession Distinct characters DBM-2 Maximum stolen leaf length, light green colour and twisty top leaves DBM-4 Maximum pedicel length and high total bacoside content especially bacoside-A3 and bacopaside-II DBM-5 Maximum herbage yields, leaf size and number of leaves DBM-9 Maximum inter nodal length and stolon thickness DBM-10 Smaller leaf size/area Crop exhibited very good plant growth round the year even under polyhouse conditions and harvested three to four times in a year. Maximum dry herbage yield was observed under open field condition as compared to polyhouse. The morphometric traits like stolon length, thickness and leaf size might be helpful for contribution in higher herbage yield. The highest fresh herbage yielding accession was DBM-5 (13.5 kg m2) followed by DBM-9 (10.1 kg m2) and DBM-4 (7.9 kg m2). On an average dry herbage yield was observed maximum in DBM-5 (19.88 t h-1y-1) followed by DBM-4 (18.84 t h-1y-1) as compared to check (17.29 t h-1y-1). The whole plant is used in indigenous system of medicine as a nerve tonic and for epilepsy and insanity due to richness in Bacosides which are a class of chemical compounds, that are dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins. Elite DBM-4 observed for having maximum average bacoside-A3 (1.13 % W/W) and bacopaside-II (2.52 % W/W) content on dry weight basis. It developed through selection and is a trait specific elite accession which produce quality herbage rich in saponins. Among the evaluated accessions, DBM-5, DBM-9, DBM-2 exhibited high herbage yield whereas DBM-4 was also containing maximum bacoside-A3 and bacopaside-II. The accession DBM-4 and DBM-5 is rich in quality as well as herbage yield, respectively. Therefore, it can be used further in crop improvement and commercial cultivation as a new selection.
