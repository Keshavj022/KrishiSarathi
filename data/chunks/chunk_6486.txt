Effect of tillage, residues and N levels on soil organic carbon (g/kg) Effect of tillage, residues and N levels on SOC pools (g/kg) kg/ha> no-N application. The carbon fractions content (very labile carbon, VLC; labile carbon, LC; less labile carbon, LLC; and non-labile carbon, NLC) were studied. MT recorded significantly higher VLC, LC and LLC compared to CT, while, CT recorded significantly higher NLC compared to MT. Among the residue levels, the trend was GL>SS>NR, while in case of the nitrogen levels it was N @90 kg/ha>60 kg/ha>30 kg/ha>control. Higher percentage of the different aggregate indices such as water stable aggregates, water stable macro- aggregates, mean weight diameter and aggregate ratio ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 124 CLIMATE RESILIENT AGRICULTURE doses of fertilizers (RDF) at higher and medium carbon strata, respectively. Application of dichorionic di- amniotic (DCDA), resulted into reduction in the GWP by 33.2 and 4.9% under higher and medium carbon stratas, respectively under conventional tillage practice, while the reduction of GWP by 25.0 and 9.7% under high carbon and medium carbon, respectively under zero tillage practice. Carbon equivalent emissions (CEE) of zero tillage (28.08 kg C/ha) was higher as compared to conventional (27.04 kg C/ha) under RDF with respect to higher carbon strata. N2O flux fluctuated between 0.60 and 15.93 mg/m2/day under zero tillage and 0.38 and 9.47 mg/m2/day under conventional tillage with respect to high carbon strata, while it ranged between 0.38 and 9.16 mg/m/day under zero tillage and 0.46 and 4.23 mg/m2/day under conventional tillage with respect to medium carbon strata. Scaling up and impact evaluation of integrated farming system for income and climate resiliency: Prototype Integrated Farming System models have been established through AICRP on Integrated Farming Systems and All India Network Programme on Organic Farming in the country for improving the income of the farmers and sustainability, besides addressing the climate change. Till now, a total of 71 prototype IFS models (including 8 integrated organic farming system models), 63 on-farm farmer participatory refined farming systems and 32 bankable models have been developed, suitable for 26 States and UTs. The states of Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana have implemented specific schemes to promote IFS models among the farming community through financial and technical backstop.
