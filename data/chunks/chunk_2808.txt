 (Mrs) Asha Dhwan, GADVASU, Ludhiana made a presentation of the centre “Aquaculture Development in Punjab: Culturing of High Value Species and Utilizing Salt-affected /Water-logged Lands”. Salient achievements: Diversification of aquaculture with high value species (catfish/air-breathing fishes) • Fingerlings of H. fossilis were successfully reared in the cemented ponds for 3 months (April to June 2011) for production of brood stock. During June & July 2011, breeding trials were carried out (without sacrifying male) by using a synthetic inducing agent ‘ovaprim’. Fish (from hatchling to fry stage) reared successfully under indoor conditions for about two months with an average survival of 40-50% and attained average length and weight of 12.5 cm and 12 g respectively. • Among different diets tried for feeding hatchlings of H. fossilis for 25 days, maximum survival (80%) was found in diet containing mixed zooplankton and egg yolk. Further, feeding of fry and fingerlings of H. fossilis for 120 days revealed maximum survival of 87.5% and 95.0 % and weight gain of 73.43% and 95.68% was observed in diets having rice bran 1: mustard cake 1: groundnut cake 2 and rice bran 1: mustard cake 1: soybean meal 2, respectively. Aquaculture technologies for salt-affected/water-logged areas of Punjab • In carp polyculture (catla, Catla catla; rohu, Labeo rohita; mrigal, Cirrhinus mrigala; grass carp, Ctenophayrngodon idella & common carp, Cyprinus carpio) trials productivity is enhanced from 2.50 to 2.94 & 3.49 t/ha/yr with increase in stocking density/rate from 10000 to 12,500 & 15,000 fingerlings/ha, respectively. Of all the species stocked registered maximum weight gain followed by rohu, grass crap, catla and common carp. • In monoculture of L. rohita trials, productivity enhanced from 2.83 to 3.23 t/ha/yr with increase in stocking density from 10000 to 12,500 fingerlings/ha. However, with increase in stocking density to 15,000/ha, productivity of 2.97 t/ha was recorded. 4 • Culture of freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii in inland saline waters revealed growth of 23-67 g (male prawn) and 3-16 g (female prawn) in 80 days. • Trials conducted on integrated fish cum duck farming in inland saline waters revealed that the ducks (Khaki Campbell) not only survived the saline conditions of the pond but also produced eggs at an expected rate of 200-250 eggs/bird/yr, The PI sought sanction of additional two SRFs which was agreed to. Expert comments: • The success story as well as the impact created by this centre within a short period was highly commended. • At some stage of the programme, the health aspects of the fish culture may also be included. 5. Dr. R. K. Pal, IARI made a presentation about the centre on “Pilot Scale Process for Coarse Cereal-based Functional Food through Extrusion Processing”.
