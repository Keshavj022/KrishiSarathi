e., loans at very less interest rates from banks for adopting SAPs in their ﬁeld. Only 45% of the farmers have received incentives in the form of higher prices from the market by selling crops gown via SAPs (Fig. 3d). 3.1.1. Endogenous variable Adoption of SAPs: We considered ﬁve sustainable practices namely conservation tillage, intercropping, crop rotation, organic fertilizers/ composts, and integrated pest management in the current study. Of these ﬁve, organic fertilizer/compost, crop rotation, and intercropping are the most widely adopted while conservation tillage and integrated pest management are the least preferred practices by the farmers. Out of the total sample size of 400 farmers, only 39% of the farmers are adopting all ﬁve types of sustainable practices in their ﬁelds for the past 5–6 years. 23% of the farmers are adopting four types of sustainable practices, 12% are adopting three, only 4% are adopting two, and 22% are practicing only one type of sustainable agriculture (Fig. 3e). The percentage of farmers adopting both practices remains notably low, at just 4%, largely because the sample is predominantly composed of middle farmers, with land areas ranging from 2 to 5 ha. Surprisingly, middle farmers were found to be the least interested in attending any training workshops, education or extension services focusing on sustainable practices, resulting in their lesser adoption of SAPs. 3.2. Model results Model-ﬁt statistics are shown in Table 3. In total, 65 parameters were estimated in the model. The p-value of Chi-Square is above 0.05, indi- cating average model ﬁt. The Adjusted goodness-of-ﬁt and goodness-of- ﬁt also indicate good model ﬁt (AGFI 0.90 and GFI >0.95). TLI (0.99) and CFI (0.99) also indicate a good ﬁt. However, RMSEA and SRMR indicate poor model ﬁt, as shown in Table 3. The conceptual model in Fig. 1 shows that the adoption of SAP is Table 3 SEM model ﬁt indices.
