15 Development of multilayer integrated farming system established at ICAR-NIASM ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 125 CLIMATE RESILIENT AGRICULTURE these rootstocks also showed better physiological traits, such as leaf RWC, PS II efficiency, chlorophyll content, NDVI, and cooler canopy, indicating their sturdy and tolerant nature. In field conditions, it revealed that Eggplant grafted on S. sisymbriifolium rootstock gave 40% higher and S. torvum rootstocks gave 19% higher yield under water deficit stress (0.6 ETc) over non-grafted (2.90 kg/plant). Water-use efficiency of eggplant grafted on S. sisymbriifolium was 13.24 kg/m3 and S. torvum was 11.22 kg/m3, whereas in non-grafted plant it was 9.43 kg/m3 at 0.6 ETc. Grafting eggplant on these rootstocks positively enhances the scion variety growth, yield and water-use efficiency in semi-arid Deccan plateau of India. Greenhouse: Comparative performance of grafted and non- grafted eggplant Field condition: Grafted eggplant evaluated in field conditions Identification of promising soybean genotypes based on drought adaptive traits and drought responsive GmEIN2 gene: A total number of 320 soybean genotypes were evaluated for drought adaptive traits under greenhouse conditions. Among 320 genotypes, 5 promising soybean genotypes (PSG) were identified for traits and genes contributing to drought stress tolerance. The level of water stress tolerance among these 5 genotypes were determined using drought adaptive traits and ethylene sensitivity indicator EIN2 gene expression analyses. Genotypes such as TGX539- 2D-7, RSC10-52 and EC 291397 revealed considerably lower expression of GmEIN2 gene, cooler canopy, more canopy greenness, higher shoot biomass and higher water status in terms of RWC as compared to drought sensitive check varieties JS-9560 and NRC-37 under well-watered conditions; PSG TGX539-2D-7, TGX-854-429 and EC- 457475 exhibited efficient photosystem-II as compared to drought tolerant check varieties JS-9752, JS7105 and drought sensitive check varieties JS-9560 and NRC-37. Performance of genotypes TGX539-2D-7, RSC10-52 and EC 291397 was found better under non-stress and water stress conditions. Productivity of rainfed crops under enhanced carbon dioxide and its interaction with water deficit and elevated temperature on black gram: The study aimed to quantify the influence of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and its interaction with elevated temperatures and moisture stress on the productivity and quality of black gram. This experiment evaluated the effects of elevated temperature (eT) and its interaction with elevated CO2 (eT+eCO2) on the phenology, physiology, biomass, and grain yield of four black gram (Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper) genotypes: IPU-06-2, PLU-826, PSRJ-95016, and IPU-094-1 under FATE facility. The eT conditions were maintained at 3.0±0.5°C above the ambient canopy temperature (aT), while eCO2 levels were kept at 550±50 ppm.
