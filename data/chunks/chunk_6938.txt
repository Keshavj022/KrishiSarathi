 The liquid formulation of microbial stimulant/enhancer was found to shorten pinhead initiation period in edible mushrooms, Macrocybe gigantea and Agaricus bisporus with enhanced yield. Yield enhancement in edible mushroom, Macrocybe gigantea (>75%) and white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus (>30%) in comparison to uninoculated control was recorded. The primordial initiation duration was shortened by 6 and 3 days in M. gigantea and A. bisporus, respectively, as compared to uninoculated control. The impact The promising Pseudomonas sp. NARs9 was inoculated at farmer’s field. The bioagent was applied in 47 bags (8 kg compost) of button mushroom at the time of casing soil application, whereas 49 bags were kept uninoculated. The total yield obtained was 96.5 kg (25.7% biological efficiency, BE) against 66.5 kg of uninoculated control (16.96% BE). The per cent increase in yield and BE were 45.1% and 8.7%, respectively. Button mushroom crop at farmers place When this strain was applied in casing soil of Macrocybe gigantea mushroom bags at farmer’s field, average yield obtained was 850 g per bag (85.0% BE) which was 54.5% higher than that of untreated control. increased from 5.71-16.67 to 10-33.34 nos. of crops/ ha/year. The farming intensity has also been increased 300 to 500%, as compared to 150-200% in traditional farming system. The models ensured generation of 409 to 570 days of employment as compared to 101-120 days in traditional farming system. Similarly, the employment productivity was also increased from 14-48.50 to 91.25- 135.71 man-days/ha/year. Among the models, one high value IFS model comprising horticultural crops (1.25 ha) + field crops (1 ha) + fish pond (1 ha) + circular carp hatchery (1 unit with 100 brooders) + piggery (3 nos.) + poultry (300 nos.) + jalkund (2 units) + agro-shade net house (2 nos.) + bee box (3 units) + vermicomposting (3 units) + fruit processing (1 unit) recorded a B:C ratio of 6.49. In Nagaland, four diverse IFS models were The impact Appreciable yield enhancement and profitability was realized through the adoption of improved varieties with recommended package of practices. With full package of practices, the crop yield improved significantly in horse gram by 30-35%, respectively than traditional crop cultivation practices. The income of farmers with the improved technologies was enhanced from 36,070- 66,270 per ha due to premium prices of horse gram in the market. The B:C ratio also improved from 0.66-1.21. Overall, from the cultivation of improved varieties farmers earned the benefit of 30,200/ha than traditional cultivars. Research for Tribal and Hill Regions icar annual report 2022-23 202 developed. Of these, Model 1 [Horticulture (2,939 sq. m) + Agriculture (1,475 sq. m) + Fishery (1,062 sq. m) + Piggery (100 sq.m) + Vermicompost (6 sq. m)] and Model 2 [Agriculture (2,116 sq. m) + Horticulture (1,611 sq.m) + fishery (500 sq. m) + Goatery (30 sq. m) + Vermicompost (6 sq.
