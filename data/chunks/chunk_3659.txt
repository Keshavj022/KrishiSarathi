 This practise also serves as a means of honouring the longstanding agricultural methods that hold cultural significance within the regionâ€™s identity. The acknowledgement of both aspects provides a significant incentive for the preservation of longstanding cultural practises and sustainable agricultural techniques that are inherent to the abundant heritage of Northeastern India. This guarantees the protection of these invaluable traditions for the welfare of forthcoming generations. Furthermore, GI tags are of utmost importance in upholding rigorous quality standards and regulations. This lack of oversight ensures that consumers consistently receive products of exceptional quality, thereby fostering trust within consumer markets. Consequently, this phenomenon serves to bolster the standing and attractiveness of horticultural commodities originating from the Northeastern region, thereby solidifying their position within the market.

These challenges include administrative hurdles, standardization issues, and increasing awareness among local farmers. Administrative Hurdles Complex Application Process: Obtaining a GI tag is a complex and time-consuming process. It involves multiple stages, including the formation of a GI association, detailed documentation, legal procedures, and consultations with various stakeholders. The administrative intricacies can be overwhelming, particularly for small- scale farmers and producers who may lack the resources and knowledge required. Financial Resources: Many small-scale farmers and producers may struggle to finance the GI tagging process. The costs associated with documentation, legal procedures, and compliance with GI regulations can be a significant burden for them. Lack of financial resources can hinder their ability to obtain GI tags. Capacity Building: Ensuring that local producers and farmers have the necessary knowledge and capacity to navigate the GI application process is crucial. Capacity- building programs and assistance in preparing the required documentation are needed to enable them to participate effectively in the GI system. Standardization Issues Maintaining Quality and Consistency: GI tagging necessitates maintaining a consistent level of quality and specific attributes associated with the product. Variations in product quality can occur due to factors like weather, soil conditions, and farming practices. Achieving and maintaining consistency poses a significant challenge. Infrastructure and Technology: The lack of modern infrastructure and technology in some remote regions of Northeastern India can hinder the production and post- harvest processing of horticulture commodities.
