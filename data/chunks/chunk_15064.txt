 Overcoming constraints through CRA India’s 160 million hectares of agricultural land cover includes five diverse bioclimatic regions, each characterized by varying annual rainfall levels, ranging from arid and semi-arid to sub-humid, humid, and coastal zones (Nath et al., 2018). These climatic variations, coupled with diverse soil types like Inceptisols and Mollisols, present significant challenges for smallholders both on and off the farm (Kuchimanchi et al., 2021). To address on-farm constraints, CRA employs various practices to improve soil health, such as conservation tillage, balanced nutrient application, crop residue management, crop rotation, weed manage- ment, and organic farming (Rahman et al., 2021; Rodríguez et al., 2022). These methods boost soil fertility, combat degradation, and promote long-term productivity (Nath et al., 2018). Water management techniques, including rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation, mulching, and drought-resistant crops, are employed to alleviate water scarcity (Pal et al., 2015). Crop diversification by introducing diverse crops and agroforestry systems further enhances resilience to climatic shocks like droughts and floods, mitigating crop failure risk (Zomer et al., 2016). CRA can also reduce reliance on costly synthetic inputs by promoting organic options, biofertilizers, and biopesticides, lowering costs for smallholders (Wolf et al., 2023). Social and economic challenges are addressed by empowering women and marginalized groups through access to land rights, credit, training, and community-based resource management that fosters collaboration and reduces costs (Dev, 2012). Access to financial services such as microloans and crop insurance mitigates financial risks and supports investment in climate-adaptive technologies (Amarnath et al., 2023; Tripathi and Bisen, 2019). Form- ing cooperatives also increases bargaining power and resource access, while CRA-linked extension services provide crucial knowledge for sustainable farming practices (Huyer et al., 2021). Beyond farm borders, CRA assists in overcoming off-farm constraints by facilitating market access through income diversification. This is achieved by integrating farming systems that combine livestock and agroforestry, creating new market opportunities and product sales av- enues (S´anchez et al., 2022). Policy and financial support also align with government programs offering crop insurance and subsidies for climate-adaptive technologies, aiding smallholders in effective risk management. Adjusting cost-benefit dynamics through pricing strate- gies and enhancing marketing margins through certification and label- ing further increases returns (Van Asseldonk et al., 2023).
