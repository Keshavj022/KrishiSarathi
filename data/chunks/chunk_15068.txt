 Integration of artificial intelligence and digital tools in CRA Artificial intelligence (AI) in agriculture includes various techno- logical advancements, such as advisory services, data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT) applications, and the use of cameras and sensors (Sahoo et al., 2024a; Singha et al., 2023b; Khan et al., 2022). AI-driven decision support systems utilize climate analytics, soil condition insights, and crop performance data to improve decision-making processes (Jung et al., 2021). By leveraging this information, these systems help reduce the risks linked to climate fluctuations and advance the agricultural industry toward sustainability (Othmeni, 2023). Investigates emerging digital innovations’ capabilities, emphasizing AI’s crucial influence in devel- oping agrifood systems that are resilient to climate change while being more efficient, sustainable, and flexible (Sahoo et al., 2024b; FAO, 2023a,b). By convening specialists across the extensive realms of agri- culture and technology, the gathering aims to foster discussions on fostering sustainable farming practices and climate initiatives, guided by the responsible utilization of data and cutting-edge technologies amidst evolving social and ethical considerations. Barkakoti et al. (2024) explored how AI technologies can improve resilience in Indian agricul- ture, focusing on how these innovations can reduce vulnerabilities and enhance productivity. Through the adoption of technological advance- ments, Indian agriculturists have the opportunity to strengthen their adaptability, lessen uncertainties, and guarantee food sustainability amidst changing agricultural scenarios. Some CRA indicators monitored by AI technology can be seen in Fig. 4 (Javaid et al., 2023). 8.1. Case study I (climate change impact for CRA analysis) This case study investigates the hydrometeorological factors impacting climate change over 62 years (1958–2020) in the Khoyrasole block of West Bengal, India, utilizing data from TerraClimate and GRACE (2002–2021) (see Fig. 5). The analysis focuses on annual pre- cipitation, maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), and climate water deficit (DEF) to assess long-term climatic trends in the region. The findings indicate a declining trend in water storage, highlighting the sensitivity of Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT) in the area (see SF.2). The region covers approximately 197.64 square kilometers and is predominantly used for agriculture (ESA, 2021). Nag and Das (2020) emphasized the shift towards monocultural rainfed farming due to inadequate irrigation infrastructure and unpre- dictable rainfall. Farmers in the region echo this challenge (see Fig. 6). - Murshidabad Farmer (LH 1): “The lack of water facilities makes it difficult to grow rice, and heavy rains sometimes destroy crops. The lowland areas are prone to waterlogging. Producing pulses is not profitable as the market price is too low for us to sell them profitably.
