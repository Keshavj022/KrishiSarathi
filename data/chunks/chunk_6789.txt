Crop Protection Wireless smart trap for automated pest monitoring in cotton: To circumvent the limitations of the conventional pheromone trapping system, a wireless smart trap was developed at the ICAR-Central Institute for Cotton Research, Maharashtra for a real time pest monitoring. The CICR Wireless Smart Trap houses four individual pheromone septa in a modified delta trap system targeting the key lepidopterous pests of cotton, viz. Pectinophora gossypiella, [7,11-hexadecadienyl acetate]; Spodoptera litura [(Z,E)-9,11-Tetradecadienyl acetate]; Helicoverpa armigera, [Z-9-Hexadecenal] and Earias vittella [(E, E)-10, 12- hexadecadienyl].
