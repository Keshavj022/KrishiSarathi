 However, some states are even having more than 30% area under micro- irrigation (Table 1) Micro-irrigation with NABARD financial assistance An initial budget of `5,000 crores (`2,000 crores for 2018–19 and `3,000 crores for 2019–20) have been granted for a dedicated micro- rrigation Fund (MIF) developed with NABARD to encourage public and private investments in micro- irrigation. The fund’s major goal was to make it easier for the states to mobilize resources for extending micro-irrigation coverage. Subsidy assistance is available up to 5.00 ha to all category farmers in each village, regardless of their economic situation. Way forward In India, micro-irrigation needs to be adopted on a large scale, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic plains, where soil salinity is high. Drip irrigation is the most efficient method, using 85–90% of the water available. According to FICCI, significant electricity savings of Table 1. States with more than 30% of the area under micro-irrigation State Net irrigated area (thousand ha) Drip irrigation Sprinkler irrigation Per cent of the area under micro-irrigation Sikkim 16 6.35 5.26 73 Andhra Pradesh 2,716 1,388.13 519.17 70 Karnataka 3,104 752.82 1,148.70 61 Maharashtra 3,163 1,314.78 561.65 59 Mizoram 16 5.09 2.45 47 Tamil Nadu 2,385 735.81 311.06 44 Gujarat 4,233 852.02 747.75 38 Sub-surface drip in maize Sub-surface drip in wheat 30.5% have been projected, and great fertilizer-use efficiency has been observed, resulting in an average consumption decrease of 28.5%. Another benefit is that optimal soil moisture conditions are maintained, which helps to boost overall production and profitability. Micro-irrigation devices have been found to assist increase the output of both fruit (42.3%) and vegetable (52.8%) crops in several studies. SUMMARY It is self-evident that micro- irrigation is critical to achieve long-term sustainability in Indian agriculture. However, there is still a long way to go, and additional demonstrations, training and awareness initiatives are needed to bring the Indian farming community up to speed on micro- irrigation procedures. Farmers are one of the most vulnerable groups in our society. We need to work with the community to demonstrate the technique’s practical and achievable benefits. Precision farming will drive the next agricultural revolution, and micro-irrigation can help farmers to achieve their aim of making farming more sustainable, profitable and productive. ‘Per drop more produce,’ on the other hand, can only be reached by deploying innovative and effective irrigation systems, which can only be developed if a healthy business is in place. To enable the effective scaling up of irrigation technology, research and extension agencies must continue to support them. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: ysshivay@hotmail.
