Proper utilization of enormous resources available in the state, exploring biodiversity and making the small & marginal farmers more resourceful are the major basis of this road map. While practicing modern agriculture in the farmers’ field along with agro-forestry/agri- horticulture, animal husbandry and fish rearing, the state has adopted “Integrated Farming”. Some of the strategies to be followed are as under: A. Irrigation resources in the state would be developed in a campaign mode in order to increase the cropping intensity. B. All possible efforts will be made to make water available in small canals & rivers during the period of drought. C. Efforts will also be made to encourage the use of suitable implements for crop State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 105 diversification, intercropping and conservation agriculture. D. Farmers will be motivated to make seed production as profitable venture and as an additional source of income, providing assistance in establishment of seed processing units to “Seed Producer Cooperative Societies” along with hybrid seed production of maize & rice. It will reduce the cost of cultivation to great extent. E. Subsidies shall be provided for the construction of compost/NADEP pits for the production of agri-inputs at village level itself in addition to intensive action which shall be taken towards the improvement of village manure pits. F. For increasing the “Lift Irrigation Acreage”, extension of electric lines along the sides of all anicuts/stop dams shall be ensured in coming five years. G. Bastar & Surguja divisions shall be developed as “Organic Farming Hub” and through certification of all the organic products, their sale and value addition will be enhanced.
