Table 4 presents results on households’ crop choice.26 Households often cultivate staple cereal grains such as paddy, wheat and maize for subsistence use, and cultivate commercial non-cereal crops such as pulses, oilseeds, fruits and vegetables for sale in nearby wholesale markets. This is evident among households in my REDS sample at baseline — only 0.3 percent of cultivators with no observed market activity grow non-cereal crops, while 64.2 percent of cultivators en- gaged in some market activity grow non-cereal crops. Examining crop choice is thus indicative of households’ intentions to retain output for home consumption or to sell output at local markets. I examine the following measures of crop choice: indicators for whether the household cultivates any non-cereal and cereal crops, the share of land that is cultivated under non-cereals, and indicators for the use of HYVs, broken down into two categories — non-cereal and cereal. I find a significant extensive margin response — there is a 26 percentage point increase in households cultivating any non-cereals (column 1), and an insignificant decline in households cultivating any cereals (column 2). In Appendix Table B7, I break down non-cereal cultivation by crop categories: fruits and vegetables, pulses, oilseeds and cash crops. I find that the uptick in non-cereal cultivation is par- ticularly driven by an increase in the cultivation of pulses. There also appears to be a significant intensive margin response — conditioning 26 Appendix Table B6 summarizes the treatment effects of improved rural road infrastructure on households’ crop choice (columns 1 to 3) for the direct (panel A) and incidental (panel B) connections respectively. on households that cultivate land in both periods, I find a 17 percentage point increase in the share of land cultivated under non-cereals (column 3).27 Further, there is substantial take up of HYVs for non-cereal crops, significant at the 1 percent level (column 4). While take up of HYVs is also positive for cereal crops, this coefficient is not precisely estimated (column 5). Taken together, these results demonstrate that remote households that gain improved road connectivity begin to cultivate hy- brid non-cereal crops on some portion of their land, while continuing to cultivate staple cereal grains. This diversification towards non-cereals is suggestive of households’ intentions to market farm output. Table 5 presents results on households’ farm input use, namely productivity-enhancing material inputs and farm labor.
