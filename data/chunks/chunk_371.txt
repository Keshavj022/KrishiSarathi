 Recognizing the importance of this sector in socio-economic development, the Government of India introduced the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) on July 5, 2019, with the objective of increasing fish production by an additional 0.7 MMT, elevating fisheries export earnings to `1,00,000 crore, doubling the income of fishers and fish farmers, reducing post- harvest losses from 20-25% to about 10%, and creating around 55 lakh gainful employment opportunities Indian Farming 73 (12): 38-41; December 2023 in the fisheries and allied sectors by 2024-25. In the context of Northeast (NE) India, fisheries play a pivotal role in driving socio-economic development and sustaining livelihoods for over 26.3 lakh people. After rice farming, it stands as the most crucial component of livelihood in this region. With more than 95% of the region’s population relying on fish as a source of animal protein, the demand for fish and its derivatives, such as dried fish, fermented fish, and smoked fish, is substantial. Despite the abundance of aquatic resources, local fish production, currently at 0.57 MMT, falls significantly short of meeting the regional demand. To bridge this gap, the region depends on fish imports from other Indian states, such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal, as well as neighbouring countries like Bangladesh. While these imports largely meet the local demand, they raise certain concerns, including the drainage of substantial funds from the region, the issue of formalin and ammonia adulteration in fish leading to health concerns, the risk of transboundary fish pathogens, and the illegal introduction of exotic or banned fish species in the region. Presently, the fish deficit in NE India amounts to 43,050 metric tonnes. When considering nutritional security, aiming for 11 kg of fish per capita per annum as per ICMR recommendations, only Tripura has achieved self-sufficiency in fish production among the states in the region. Meghalaya faces the most significant fish deficit. Looking back, until 2004-05, NE India’s annual fish production was a mere 0.24 MMT. However, focused and integrated efforts have resulted in an impressive 137.5% increase in fish production, reaching the current annual figure of 0.57 MMT. Despite this progress, substantial challenges persist. These include overconsumption of fish beyond nutritional requirements, sustaining production and productivity levels once government support is stopped, reducing production costs, and mitigating the associated carbon footprint. Fish holds a significant place in the culinary traditions of NE India, acting as a crucial source of animal Indian Farming 39 December 2023 protein for over 43 million people. In recent times, spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for fish, particularly fresh fish, has notably increased in the region, driven by a growing awareness of its benefits as a ‘health food’.
