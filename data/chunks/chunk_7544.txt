 Several miRNAs/target genes were Relative fold change of miRNAs in mock (S0_R0), susceptible (S0_S96), resistant (R0_R96) and susceptible vs resistant treatment 96 h after pathogen inoculation (S96_R96) Distribution of (a) context-wise DMRs and (b) hypo/hypermethylated DMRs in four pairs of comparisons. Hypo, hypomethylated; Hyper, hypermethylated expression and DNA methylation. The results are being validated using qRT-PCR and Chop-PCR. The computational prediction of non-coding(nc) RNAs and effectors was carried out in the available P. triticina genome sequences; some of these ncRNAs/effectors were validated using qRT-PCR. Genome editing for importing PRSV resistance: A host gene eIF4E (involved in virus translation) and a virus gene, Genome-linked viral protein (Vpg) (interacts with eIF4E) are being targeted to inhibit the host-virus interaction through genome editing approach. Cloning, sequencing and identification of eIF4E from the papaya indicated the presence of two isoforms, eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E. The eIF4E is 711 base pairs coding for 236 amino acids, while, eIF(iso)4E is slightly shorter at 207 amino acids. Amino acid change at 168_T/G was conspicuous and was present in most of the apparently healthy lines. Bioinformatics analysis was carried out to understand the interacting region between eIF4E gene sequence from papaya and VPG gene from the virus. The amino acid residues involved in ligand binding fall in to 3 domains: 61– 54, 96–100 and 155–169. Based on the analysis, multiple PAM sites were selected for editing. Apart from these, the off target effects were assessed employing similarity to other host genes. Three gRNA sequences were synthesized and cloned in suitable vector having Cas9 gene. PRSV culture was established and checked with different virus identification techniques and Vpg gene from the PRSV genome was amplified, cloned and sequenced. Using suitable SUPPORTING BASIC AND STRATEGIC RESEARCH ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 177 identified and 10 of them have been validated. Genome wide association study, on panel comprising of 189 genotypes, led to identification of 31,956 SNPs. Twenty three genomic loci exhibiting significant association with seed protein have been identified. Five QTLs were identified for grain protein in a biparental mapping population involving JAKI 9218 (Low GPC) × T 39- 1 (High GPC) (n=200, F3:4). These were mapped to LG3, LG4, LG6 and LG8. Molecular mapping and identification of candidate genes for anthracnose fruit rot disease resistance in chilli: A total of 357 F2 segregating populations along with contrast parents were genotyped and based on GBS analysis, aligned with Capsicum baccatum_CM008444.1 and Capsicum baccatum_ PBC81 whole genome sequence data, 8644 SNP markers were identified and consensus linkage map developed. The distribution of SNPs was observed across the 12 chromosomes.
