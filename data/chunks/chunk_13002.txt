 Hence, application of drip irrigation technology to potato crop has the potential of enhancing farmers’ average income by `50000/ha or `51800/farm for nearly 5% of potato farmers. ICAR-Central Potato Research Institute Shimla has invested tremendous time and energy for transforming seed potato system from traditional to high tech (with biotechnology applications and further using aeroponics technology) during one decade or so. This technological upgradation has started paying dividends in terms of better availability of healthy seed potato throughout the country and higher potato yields realization. During 2015-16, about 30% of potato area in India was estimated to be under healthy seed potato with average triennium ending yield of 22.94 t/ha. By 2022-23, 55% of Indian potato area is estimated to be covered under healthy seed potato with 20% yield enhancement in the additional 25% to be brought under healthy seed potato coverage which will transform into ` 20000/ha or ` 20720/farm for about 5.5 lakh ha area and 5.3 lakh farmers. Potential benefits of application of drip irrigation in potato crop Attribute Benefit Yield advantage 33 to 39.5% Fertilizer saving 25% Labour saving 30-35% Higher price of the produce 25% Overall income enhancement ` 50000/ ha Note: Estimated 5% potato area in India was under drip-irrigation during 2015-16 and another 5% is expected to be covered under this irrigation system by 2022-23. Role of high-tech seed potato production in India (including the aeroponics system) About 30% potato area was covered by Healthy seed potato healthy seed during 2015-16. Estimated will enhance potato 25% additional potato area is expected to productivity by 20% be covered under healthy seed potato by on 5.5 lakh ha 2022-23. Average potato productivity (estimated 5.3 lakh in India was 22.94 t/ha (TE 2015-16) farmers) resulting in additional average ` 20000/ha or ` 20720/farm. Table 2.

Increasing non-farm income of farmers is also at very high level of importance inour country where half of the population is employed in agriculture but gets less than 14% of national income distributed among themselves. The central government have promoted, supported and integrated schemes like ‘STARTUP’ India into agriculture so that farmers can initiate agro-enterprises and integrate non-agricultural elements into their businesses.
