The United States (USGS, 2023) and Europe (EEA, 2023) suffer with nitrate pollution, whereas Africa (Kazapoe et al., 2024), Australia (CSIRO, 2023), and South America (Araya et al., 2024) confront with fluoride, salinity, and pesticide contamination. Recent studies under­ score the necessity of sustainable practices and more stringent re­ strictions globally. In recent decades, a variety of studies have been performed to investigate the hydrogeochemical aspects and quality of water, focusing on the effects of both natural and anthropogenic pol­ lutants as well as both the chemical and physical characteristics of groundwater. However, with advancement in society, the quality of water has notably declined due to a range of natural and anthropogenic factors actions, influencing the hydrogeological surroundings and community well-being (Karthikeyan et al., 2018; Gad et al., 2024). The sustainability of these water resources is compromised by various fac­ tors, such as environmental challenges, human activities, and natural events. Typically, these factors compromise the chemical and physical compositions of groundwater, making it unsuitable for agricultural ap­ plications (Ibrahim et al., 2023). Groundwater is a valuable asset, especially in dry and semi-arid provinces. In recent decades, ground­ water quality has been significantly degraded and threatened by factors such as climate change, population growth, and industrial growth, agriculture activity and subsurface hydro-geochemical processes (Karunanidhi et al., 2020a; Karunanidhi et al., 2020b; Hussein et al., 2024). Agriculture, signifies as the largest consumer of groundwater glob­ ally. The supply of irrigation water is a crucial element affecting the growth of agricultural output in arid and semi-arid regions, impacting both feasible crop yields and the expansion of irrigated areas (Venkatesan et al., 2020; Ibrahim et al., 2023). Irrigation water quality is a critical factor affecting the well-being and yield of crops such as vegetables (Venkatesan and Subramani, 2019; Ashie et al., 2024). Water quality, crop kinds, irrigation practices, land use, soil quality and structure affect the capability of groundwater in terms of agricultural practices (Sakram et al., 2022; Jasmin and Mallikarjuna, 2015). Ac­ cording to CGWB, 2016 and Zafar et al. (2024), approximately 91 % of India’s groundwater is utilized for irrigation and 9 % for residential purposes. In India, the Green Revolution and inexpensive pump set technology caused a change in irrigation patterns in the early 1980s, leading to the overexploitation of groundwater resources.
