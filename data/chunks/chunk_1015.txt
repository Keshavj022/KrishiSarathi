 Way forward Since millet stovers are the most important feed resources in the arid and semi-arid regions of India, considerable research effort has gone into improving their nutritional value through crop management and chemical treatment as well as supplementation through high protein oil cakes, and green fodder. However, the on-farm adoption of these technologies has been low due to improper fit of the technology in the farming system, low resource availability and lack of significant and visible economic benefits. The other possibility of improvement in the quality of stover would be to include a legume along with the millet crop itself. SUMMARY Stover from millet crops is well suited for feeding the cattle and its quality can be enhanced by treatments. The cost of stover in several millets compensates the cost of inputs in cultivation. Moreover the farmers depend on this by-product to a large extent in maintaining their milch and draught animals. In many instances the farmers are willing to sacrifice grain but not fodder. A short-duration (60–80 days) millet crop can yield up to 15 tonnes of green fodder per hectare of land. This is more appropriate in dryland (rainfed) conditions, including crop rotations systems. Millets as green forage crops assume more importance especially in scarce rainfall years. The small millet grains can also become a good substitutes for other cereal grains in the preparation of concentrate mixture of livestock and poultry, thereby reducing the cost of feed as well. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: bhatv@millets.res.in Table 2.
