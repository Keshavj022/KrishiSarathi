 The project has achieved reduction in age at first calving in Murrah buffalo by 8 months i.e., from 50.7 months in 1993 to 42.8 months in 2020, calving interval by 50 days and service period by 112 days. Nili-Ravi and Bhadawari breed Centers are functioning as conservation and improvement units and Jaffarabadi and Surti breed Centers are concentrating on field progeny testing along with maintaining the elite herd for bull production and testing. So far 9 sets of the Nili-Ravi bulls have been progeny tested under the NPBI. The performance of Nili-Ravi Achievements in Livestock and Poultry Production in Independent India 145 Nucleus herd has been increased from 1885 kg during 2001-02 to 2679 kg during 2018-19 (42% increase in SLMY). A total of 10 progeny tested Nili-Ravi bulls have been produced under the project with highest genetic superiority of 25.07%. Calf mortality has been reduced from 13.2% to 3.3% in 2019-20. The performance of Jaffarabadi Nucleus herd has been increased from 1814 kg during 2001-02 to 2245 Kg during 2019-20 (24% increase in SLMY). Total 9 progeny tested Surti bulls have been produced under the project with highest genetic superiority of 19%. Significant reduction in AFC of Surti buffaloes has been recorded from 49.75 months in 2003-04 to 45.29 months in 2019-20. Performance of Bhadawari herd has increased from 1029 kg in 2003-04 to 1286 kg in 2019-20 (25% increase in SLMY). 4.3. Sheep An All India Coordinated Research Programme (AICRP) on sheep breeding was launched by the ICAR in 1971, which was later converted to Network project on Sheep Improvement and Mega Seed Sheep Project in 1990 with four farm-based units on four indigenous sheep breeds viz. Marwari, Muzzafarnagri, Deccani and Nellore; and two field units on Madras Red and Magra sheep. The growth traits since inception have remarkably improved to achieve body weight at 3 months which was earlier achieved at 6-month of age and the weight which was earlier achieved at 12 months is now achieved at 6-month age; thus, improving the mutton production, and reducing the marketable age as also the cost of rearing. Improvements in survivability and reproductive performance have also yielded extra lambs, thus yielding more mutton more return. Weight at birth was improved up to 28% (2.5 to 3.3 kg), at 6 months improved up to 86% (Malpura; 14.0 vs 26.0 kg) and at 12 months improved up to 65% (19 kg to 32 kg in Marwari sheep) since inception (1975 vs. 2020). The overall survivability (96%) and lambing % (88%) have improved by 22% and 20%, respectively since inception. 4.4. Goat All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Goat Improvement in 1971 was started with the main objective of improving the performance of goat for milk, meat and fiber (Pashmina) production in different parts of the country. Crossbreeding and selective breeding approaches have been undertaken to improve the productivity performance of goats.
