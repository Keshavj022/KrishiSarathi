This amounts to an enhancement of 6.1-fold with respect to 50.8 million tonnes in 1950-51. The bumper food grain production is primarily attributed to cultivation of high yielding crop varieties and hybrids developed by the National Agricultural Research System (NARS) led by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Malnutrition has emerged as a major health problem. It affects growth and development, and reduces the work efficiency in humans, besides having huge economic and societal implications. Among various avenues, crop biofortification has emerged as the most sustainable and cost- effective approach to address malnutrition. I am happy to learn that ICAR and State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) have made significant progress in development of high yielding biofortified varieties and hybrids in cereals, millets, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables and fruits. Dedication of 29 biofortified crop cultivars in two batches to the nation by Hon’ble Prime Minister during 2020- 21 is an endorsement of country’s preparedness to alleviate malnutrition through a sustainable approach. The information on biofortified cultivars was earlier published in the form of a booklet entitled ‘Biofortified Varieties: Sustainable Way to Alleviate Malnutrition’. Now this publication has been updated through ‘fourth edition’ with 87 biofortified varieties of 16 different crops. I congratulate the developers of these varieties and hybrids, and appreciate the ICAR for this significant initiative.
