 Observations recorded at 2 days after spraying showed that Bt is on a par with Endosulfan check in terms of its efficacy against castor semilooper. Mutants of Trichoderma viride-B16 and T. koningii-B19 have been developed through UV irradiation. They are found more virulent than native isolates and possess tolerance to Carbendazim. LINSEED Crop Improvement Under NATP exploration programme, 88 local land-races have been collected from Orissa, West Bengal, Bihar and NEH region. During 2000-2001, a total of 8.29 tonnes of breeder seed of 12 linseed varieties was produced against the indent of 4.72 tonnes. Crop Production At Raipur, sowing of double-purpose linseed in mid November with 67.5 kg of seed/ha was the best treatment to harvest better yields of seed and fibre. ● ●● ●● A protocol for castor transformation through Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer has been optimized. ● Mutants of Trichoderma viride B 16 and T. koningii B 19 for castor-wilt management are found more virulent than their native isolates. The small and marginal tribal-farmers of Karkalphad, Narlakunta, Eluguralla and Gadamedi hamlets of Amangal Mandal in Mahaboobnagar district of Andhra Pradesh used to grow sorghum, vegetables, castor and rice. Castor is one of the important cash crops of farmers. Farmers being economically poor could not afford good quality seed of improved varieties/hybrids. A team of the scientists of Directorate of Oilseeds Research (DOR), prepared an action plan for production of castor seed by these farmers. Nearly 146 farmers were convinced about the seed-village concept to undertake seed production of DCS 9, a high-yielding castor. In this programme, the Andhra Pradesh State Seed Certification Agency and M/s Vijayavardhini Oilseeds Growers Federation were associated for Seed Certification and procurement of surplus seeds. The breeder seed of DCS 9 was supplied by the DOR. The net area covered for seed production was 376 acres. A total of 115 tonnes of seed could be produced, out of which 23 tonnes were procured by M/s Vijayavardhini Oilseed Growers Federation and 10 tonnes by the private companies. About 2 tonnes was kept by the farmers for their own use. Rest of the seeds were sold by farmers in the open market. These farmers have now formed their own Cooperative Society for seed production to extend seed production activities further.
