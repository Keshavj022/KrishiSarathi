 In this context, leveraging the voluntary educational efforts of Indian youth for inno- vative climate resilience training presents a promising opportunity. Although this approach alone may not serve as a comprehensive solu- tion, it undoubtedly holds significant potential and warrants further exploration and development. 11. Recommendations and future directions This study aligns closely with several SDGs within social, environ- mental, and governance frameworks (see Fig. 8). In the social context, CRA supports SDGs such as no poverty (SDG~1), zero hunger (SDG~2), gender equality (SDG~5), and reduced inequalities (SDG~10) by focusing on community development, education, and welfare programs. Environmentally, CRA aligns with SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 13 (climate action), and 15 (life on land) through efforts like renewable energy implementation and water resource management. Additionally, cooperatives contribute to community growth by facilitating partnerships with government, businesses, and educational institutions, positioning them to fulfill SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 17 (partnerships for the goals). Regional planning is essential for addressing geographic disparities in environmental resilience. Comprehensive supervision strategies and detailed contingency plans are necessary to manage resources effec- tively in areas experiencing reckless groundwater withdrawal (Sikka et al., 2022). Implementing web-based, near-real-time monitoring of hotspots for pests, diseases, soil spectroscopy systems, and vulnerable Fig. 8. SDGs indicators that can be answered by CRA strategy. S.

To enhance climate adaptation, local traditional knowledge should guide the planning of agricultural adaptation strategies, ensuring un- biased access to irrigation techniques and field-based cropping patterns (Bahinipati and Patnaik, 2022). These factors can enhance profits, water efficiency, and value creation. Frequent training sessions delivered to farmers and the availability of incentives aid in a quicker degree of re- covery. Diversifying agriculture and livelihoods is essential to managing climate uncertainties and promoting resilience through crop-livestock diversity and agro-meteorological practices (Birthal and Hazrana, 2019). This diversification reduces vulnerability to low yields and food insecurity by improving adaptive measures and extension services. Implementing weather and crop insurance, especially in regions with limited capital access, can effectively manage risks (Madaki et al., 2023). Extending credit in these areas expands the capacity for pre- and post-climate response. Policy interventions must address grassroots institutional gaps to foster knowledge sharing.
