The frequency of αS1-Cn AA allele (which was directly related to higher casein yield) was 0.89, 0.89, 0.93, 0.78 and 0.85 in Jamunapari, Barbari, Marwari, Sirohi and Jakhrana goats, respectively. The F variant was also observed as homozygous FF in two samples of Jamunapari goats. The most prevalent variant was A type at αS2-Cn locus in these breeds. The αS2-Cn allele was absent in all the breeds, highest frequency was in Jakhrana (0.43) and lowest in Marwari (0.22) goats. A faster migrating variant in ß-Cn locus, observed in Jamunapari goats indicated the existence of an additional ß-Cn allele in the electrophoretic pattern. The distribution frequency of αS1-Cn was higher in all goat breeds except Sirohi. The five Indian goat breeds studied were in H.W. equilibrium at αS1-Cn and ß-LG loci. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 96 by 25 microsatellite markers in Sahiwal and Hariana breeds were 151 and 169, respectively. In Sahiwal detected alleles ranged from 3 to 13 with a mean number of 6.04 alleles/microsatellite marker. In Hariana detected alleles ranged from 4 to 15 with a mean number of 6.76 alleles/microsatellite marker. Within breed, diversity for each marker was calculated in terms of heterozygosity and polymorphism information content (PIC) value. The unbiased estimates of expected heterozygosity at different microsatellite loci ranged from 0.200 to 0.877 in Sahiwal and 0.388 to 0.916 in Hariana. The PIC values were 0.186 to 0.861 in Sahiwal and 0.367 to 0.901in Hariana. Buffalo: The number of alleles and their frequencies at eight microsatellite loci in Murrah, Nili Ravi, Jaffarabadi and Mehsana breeds, were studied. Locus BT13 had maximum (11) alleles and locus B246 minimum (5). The overall average number of alleles at these loci was 8.37 ± 1.76 and overall average number of effective alleles was 4.27 ± 1.72. The overall observed heterozygosity across all loci ranged from 0.491 to 0.891 and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.470 to 0.870 for the same loci, indicating suitability of these microsatellite loci for genetic diversity study in Indian buffaloes. Overall observed heterozygosity across all four breeds ranged from 0.590 to 0.709 and He ranged from 0.657 to 0.690, which indicated random sampling and genetic variation of these populations. Most of the loci studied, were at HWE indicating the loci to be neutral. This is an important criterion for selection of microsatellite locus in biodiversity analysis. However, the locus BT13 showed a significant departure from HWE in all the breeds. PCR based mtDNA studies: Mitochondrial DNA marker, viz.
