 It gets moisture and nutrients, once the farmer irrigates and applies fertilizers to the main crop in the field. Grass is ready for first cutting at 60-70 days after planting, subsequent cuttings can be taken as and when needed. Utilizing these bunds for growing fodder especially BN hybrid grass offers multiple benefits, including increasing fodder availability, preventing soil erosion and enhancing water conservation. It also serves as natural windbreaks and thermal barriers that protect adjoining crops from heatwaves during summer. This practice has emerged as a viable solution for enhancing farm productivity while maintaining ecological balance. Demonstrations In Jhansi district, the practice of cultivating fodder on bunds was demonstrated in adopted villages under the FFP. The demonstrations focused on showing farmers how to use existing bunds effectively for growing BN hybrid grass, thus ensuring that their livestock has access to a continuous supply of green fodder while maintaining the fertility and health of the soil. Farmers were selected based on their willingness to participate and the availability of livestock. Fields with existing bunds were identified. The IGFRI team provided Uttam Rajpoot and several other farmers in the area with rooted slips of BN hybrid grass. It was planted along the bunds of his vegetable fields, where they thrived with minimal water requirements. Benefits The practice of growing fodder on bunds offers multiple benefits, not only in terms of providing fodder for livestock but also in improving the overall agricultural system. Below are some of the key advantages observed during the demonstrations: Increased fodder availability: Uttam Rajpoot’s most immediate benefit was the availability of a regular supply of fodder for his livestock. With the fodder on the bunds, he could feed his livestock fresh, nutritious fodder without using additional land, leaving his primary fields free for vegetable cultivation. By adopting the technology, he is able to harvest about 100-130 quintals of green fodder from a 300-meter-long bund. This not only saved him money that would have been spent on buying fodder but also ensured that his animals received quality fodder, improving their health and increasing milk production. Soil and water conservation: The grass on bunds helped in stabilizing the soil, reducing erosion caused by water. The deep-rooted grass also improves water infiltration and reduces surface runoff, helping in soil conservation. The bunds acted as barriers that prevented water runoff and soil erosion, conserving moisture for longer periods. Protection from heatwaves: The bunds planted with BN hybrid grass also served another crucial function— protecting his vegetable crops from heatwaves during summers. In Bundelkhand, where summer temperatures can reach extreme levels, vegetable seedlings are vulnerable to heat stress.
