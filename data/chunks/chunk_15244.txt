 The primary goal of precision irrigation is to optimize water usage, improve crop yield, and conserve water resources. It relies on smart sensors and automated systems to provide accurate data and enable precise water application [47]. Figure 6 shows working procedure of precision irrigation with real-time sensor feedback. Beneﬁts of precision irrigation with real-time sensor feedback. Water efﬁciency: By providing water only where and when it is required, precision irrigation minimizes water wastage, leading to signiﬁcant water savings and improved water-use efﬁciency. Enhanced crop yield: Plants obtain appropriate water quantities at suitable moments promoting optimal growth and improved yields. Reduced costs: Precision irrigation can lead to cost sav- ings by reducing water consumption, labor, and energy asso- ciated with irrigation practices. Environmental impact: Through the preservation of water reserves and the reduction of runoff and leaching of fertilizers and pesticides, precision irrigation helps reduce the environmental impact of agriculture. Scalability and adaptability: Precision irrigation techni- ques can be applied to various crop types and ﬁeld sizes, making them suitable for different agricultural settings. Precision irrigation with real-time sensor feedback repre- sents a signiﬁcant advancement inmodern agriculture, contrib- uting to sustainable and efﬁcient water resource management while meeting the challenges of feeding a growing global population. 5.3. Crop Treatment Strategies: Customized Interventions for Healthier Crops. Crop treatment strategies involve a range of customized interventions aimed at promoting healthier crops and maximizing agricultural productivity. These strat- egies focus on identifying and addressing speciﬁc crop health issues while minimizing environmental impact and ensuring sustainable farming practices. Here are some key crop treat- ment strategies: i. Disease and pest surveillance: Regular monitoring and early detection of crop diseases and pest infes- tations are crucial for timely interventions. Farmers can use smart sensors, remote sensing technologies, and ﬁeld scouting to identify problems early, 16 Journal of Sensors 1. Smart sensors 2. Real-time data collection 3. Data analysis 4. Targeted water delivery 5. Automation and control Various types of sensors are deployed in the agricultural field to monitor key parameters such a soil moisture, temperature humidity, and weather conditions. Soil moisture sensors, in particular play a crucial role in determining the actual water needs of the plants These sensors continuously measure the relevant environmental and soil conditions. The collected data are transmitted in real-time to a central system, which can be accessed by the farmer through computers, smartphones, or other devices How precision irrigation with real-time sensor feedback works The data collected from the sensors is analyzed using sophisticated algorithms and software.
