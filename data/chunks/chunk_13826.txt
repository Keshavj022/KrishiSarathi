38 LMT when compared to the production levels of the previous year, 2021–22. It is estimated that total rice production has reached a new high of 120 MT, up from 118.87 MT in the previous year. Pulse production is also predicted to be higher than the previous year. It is anticipated to reach 24.42 MT in 2020–21, up from 23.03 MT in the previous year, 2019–20. Compared to the previous year, total food grain production is 2 percent higher. However, with a population of 1.3 billion people, India has become the world’s second most populated country, which brings several sig­ nificant challenges that we need to consider [2]. India is home to one-fourth of the world’s hungry and over 190 million undernourished people. In addition, India ranks 114th out of 132 countries for the per­ centage of children under the age of five who are stunted, 120th out of 130 countries for the percentage of children under the age of five who are wasted, and 170th out of 185 countries for the percentage of people who are anemic [3]. This results in a significant increase in the demand for nutrient-dense foods in large quantities, which can be satisfied by the production of newly developed technologies such as hydroponics, aquaponics, aeroponics, and so on, which allow nutrient-dense foods to be grown in a comparatively smaller area than traditional systems do [4]. The adoption of better technologies remains modest in India, particularly in the context of developing areas and countries, despite the fact that these technologies have a very powerful impact on the well- being of farmers [5]. It is important to note that factors on both the demand and supply sides play a significant part in the acceptance and * Corresponding author. E-mail address: rajnish.rakholia@gmail.com (R.

Awareness and under­ standing of technology, access to credit and appropriate inputs, risk implications, and marginal returns are examples of demand-side factors [2] (Table 1). Supply-side elements include policy support, investment in agricul­ tural research and extension systems, infrastructural availability, and institutional structures for the delivery and exchange of innovations [6]. A perfect balance of demand and supply side elements accelerates the adoption rate of advanced technologies for obtaining desired results. The public sector agriculture research system in India is primarily responsible for the creation and dissemination of better technology [2]. The private sector is continuously contributing to the development and marketing of smart technologies as time passes [7].
