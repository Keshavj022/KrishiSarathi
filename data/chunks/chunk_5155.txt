 RESULT AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Identification and collection The specimens of banana inflorescence and baykhal were identified and collected from Palampur and Karsog areas respectively. Field survey The CCPI visited Karsog area and contacted Senior Veterinary Officer, Karsog, Veterinary Officers of Tehsil Karsog and the farmers of surrounding villages. The discloser was also contacted and interviewed. The information regarding the ITK was collected personally as well as with the assistance of contractual helper appointed locally under the supervision of the Veterinary Officer In charge, CVH, Pangna. In addition the farmers of Palampur and District Solan were also contacted. The information so gathered is summarized: 1. No. of villages surveyed : 37 2. No. of persons contacted : 180 3. Occupation of respondents : (a) Agriculture : 167 (b) Government service : 10 (c) Business : 3 All the respondents were rearing the animals for more than 20 years. Incidence A total of 180 farmers were contacted. They had observed 2,656 calving during the period of rearing of animals, of which only 133 had suffered from retained placenta. The area-wise information as revealed by the farmers regarding number of calving observed, number of cases of retained placenta observed and incidence of retention of placenta is presented in Table 1 (Fig. 5). The overall incidence of retention of placenta under field condition was 5% (133/2,656 calvings) Availability Banana was planted by limited number of farmers and usually the inflorescence was available during September to March season only. Baykhal, a wild shrub, grows on the uncultivable land and was abundantly available throughout the Fig. 5.

Treatment adopted under field conditions The detailed information pertaining to popularity of ITK therapy, various methods being adopted by the farmers for treatment or management of retained placenta under field conditions and their efficacy are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 and Fig. 6. Karsog, Solan and Palampur was 38.46, 96.8 and 100 per cent respectively. None of the farmers had any knowledge regarding use of ITK under investigation, however, some other indigenous decoctions were used in 25.96 and 7.14 per cent cases of retained placenta in Karsog and Solan respectively. Thirty Seven (35.57%) animals did not receive any treatment in Karsog area and Table 2.
