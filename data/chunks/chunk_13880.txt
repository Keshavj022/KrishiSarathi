 Means and their corresponding standard deviations (SD) represent continuous variables, while categorical variables are shown as counts and percentages within each category. Independent t-tests were performed to assess the signiﬁcance of differences between the two groups, with a threshold of p < 0.05 indicating statistical signiﬁcance. literacy skills. Statistical analysis revealed no signiﬁcant differences in various factors such as age, weight, height, alcohol consumption, dietary habits, BMI or educational level. However, a notable difference was found in the gender distribution between the two groups. Tables 2 and 3 show the participants’ knowledge, practises and attitudes towards pesticides and pesticide-related symptoms. 4. Experimental Design, Materials and Methods The study design is illustrated in Fig. 1 , which shows the selection of the study area and the structure of the questionnaire. The questionnaire is divided into different sections, the ﬁrst section demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the participants. The second section participants’ knowledge of safety precautions when using pesticides. Finally, the third section for self-reported symptoms experienced by participants after exposure to pesticide sprays. This comprehensive design ensures a multi-faceted approach to data collection, covering demo- graphic proﬁles, understanding of safety measures and potential health effects. This structured questionnaire generates a comprehensive data set to understand participants’ experiences and perceptions of pesticide use and associated impacts.
