 By breeding crops with enhanced resistance to pests and diseases, the need for chemical interventions is minimized. This shift towards eco-friendly farming aligns seamlessly with global calls for greener practices, ensuring that the agricultural sector remains a steward of the environment. Quality is another paramount aspect of ICAR’s new varieties of fruits and vegetables. Beyond mere quantity, there is a pronounced emphasis on enhancing the sensory and nutritional attributes of produce. The outcome is not only visually appealing fruits and vegetables but also those that are richer in essential nutrients, meeting the evolving preferences of the modern consumer. Farmers, the backbone of our agrarian society, stand to gain significantly from ICAR’s initiatives. The adoption of these improved varieties can translate into increased incomes, reduced dependency on agrochemicals, and greater overall efficiency in farming operations. Moreover, the versatility of ICAR’s hybrids allows for cultivation in a spectrum of environments, promoting agricultural diversity and resilience. ICAR’s commitment to advance agricultural practices is evident in its latest foray into horticulture technologies presented in the current Indian Horticulture issue. Hope this issue will be beneficial to all the agrarian stakeholders. (Dr Suresh K Malhotra) January–February 2024 3 K HEJRI (Prosopis cineraria) is a multi-function flora of Thar Desert. Its seedling grows naturally and trees are found abundant under the inhospitable arid climate of India. It is the lifeline tree of the desert and is promoted extensively because of its significance to local inhabitants for food and fodder, besides its favourable impact on the ecosystem. It is the most important component of the traditional farming systems and tolerates extremely high and low temperatures, and the lush green foliage in summer bears fruits too. The immature pods (sangri) are used widely both fresh and dehydrated for vegetable culinary, and sold at high prices (@ 200 & 800 ₹/kg, respectively). Sangri is the main constituent of Panchkutta vegetables and it is rich in minerals such as potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, iron and in addition a good source of protein and dietary fiber. Sangri also contains high antioxidants, phenols, flavonoids and saponins, which boost immunity and reduce bad cholesterol in the blood.
