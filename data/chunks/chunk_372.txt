 Furthermore, the understanding that fish farming is a highly lucrative livelihood enterprise has firmly taken root in the public consciousness. Substantial opportunities also exist to create secondary livelihood avenues through value additions in the fish supply chain. This surge in the demand for fresh fish, coupled with the potential to expand livelihood opportunities, aligns seamlessly with the broader global trend that emphasizes locally-sourced fish and sustainable aquaculture practices. To effectively address this situation, the current concentration of fish production methods in land-based systems, such as ponds and tanks, needs diversification through innovative approaches like enclosure culture, specifically, cage culture and pen culture. Cage culture, in particular, offers a promising solution, as it provides protection for fish from all sides. By adopting this innovative technique, not only can a stable fish supply be ensured, but also the region’s economic growth and food security can be supported. Community cage culture in Dumbur Reservoir, Tripura The extensive and diverse aquatic ecosystems of NE India provide an excellent backdrop for implementing cage culture. By cultivating a variety of fish species, either individually or together within cages, this method can offer a sustainable and localized fish supply. This aligns with local preferences for fresh fish and reduces reliance on imports. Cage culture’s capacity to produce fish intensively in controlled environments alleviates the burden on natural fish stocks and ecosystems, promoting long-term sustainability. By embracing cage culture and advocating for responsible practices, NE India can not only address its increasing demand for fish but also empower local communities, enhance nutritional intake, and drive economic growth. With the abundance of vast open water bodies and the enhancement of these resources through cage culture, NE India possesses the potential to shift from being a ‘fish importer’ to transforming into a ‘fish exporter.’ This change could benefit not only India but also its neighboring countries such as Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, etc. where the demand for fresh fish is high. Community-based cage culture (CBCC) represents a highly innovative method involving the stocking, rearing, and management of fish within cages, all under the active participation of the local community. In the context of NE India, where the local population has a deep connection to fish and water-related pursuits, this approach holds immense promise. Embracing CBCC can effectively rejuvenate cage culture, propelling it forward as a promising avenue to cultivate sustainable development within fishery-based livelihoods across the region.
