Income induced effects on food consumption pattern of Indian households : The study has modelled consumer behaviour to simulate likely effect of income shocks on consumption pattern in the context of COVID-19. The estimated elasticities varied across different commodities, implying a differential response of change in income on consumption of different commodities. Among the food groups, cereals exhibited positive but lowest expenditure elasticity value of 0.37. Thus, with the change in income, consumption of cereals changed but only marginally. Edible oils, pulses and vegetables are relatively more elastic as compared to cereals, but in case of change in income, consumption of these commodities will change less than proportionately. For milk and non-vegetarian products, elasticities values are closer to one. Fruits and other foods exhibited elastic expenditure elasticities and change in income of the households will change consumption of these commodities more than proportionately. Overall, average weighted (expenditure share) elasticity of food is 0.80 (inelastic), implying food a necessary item for the consumers. The expenditure elasticity of non-food expenses has been estimated as 1.23. Thus, with the change in income, households will change expenditure on non-food items more than proportionately. These results indicate that with the impact of change in income on consumption will vary across different commodities depending on the elasticity values. Trade assessment in agriculture: Trade liberalization helps accelerate economic growth in medium run by increasing the allocative efficiency and investment.
