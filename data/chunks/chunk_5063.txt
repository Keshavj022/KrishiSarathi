 The stability in aphid population may be due to a balance in birth, migration and death. A significant decline in aphid population was observed for all treatments with fresh buffalo urine. Sprays of both 30% and 100% urine concentrations were most effective and were faster in eradicating the aphids. Though, 10% and20% fresh buffalo urine treatments also reduced the aphid number after day 10, the total eradication of aphids took longer time (40-43 days) than by 30% and 100% urine concentration treatments, and significant decline was observed on day 20 with the treatments > 20%. This may be due to overdilution of certain insecticidal chemicals present in the fresh buffalo urine. The effect of fresh buffalo urine treatment on the number of leaves and plant height remained insignificant, in each case the final observations showed no appreciable difference between the treated and untreated cabbage, through the same lag in plant height was present in this case. It too diminished at later stages of development, as in previously observed results. Both pure aged and pure fresh buffalo urine were found equally effective against Brevecoryne brassicae and were able to eradicate it before day 25. It indicated that both are equally effective against cabbage aphid (Fig. 6). Fig. 6. Comparative effect of aged and fresh buffalo urine spray on the number of aphids per plant Effect of aged sheep urine on aphid popula-tion and growth of cabbage The results of this experiment are given in Tables 7 and 8 and Fig.7. Control (unsprayed) cabbage showed a continuous increase in the number of aphids per plant and later on achieved a balance in aphid population due to birth,  HORTICULTURAL CROPS Table 7.
