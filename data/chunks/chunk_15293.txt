 Such data-driven approaches allow users to make more timely decisions on when plants should be planted and how to irrigate, fertilize, or apply pesticides, aiming to improve crop productivity and cost efficiency by reducing environmental impact [216–219]. Pandey et al. [220] reported that many features in programming languages like MATLAB and FORTRAN are mathematical functions. These mathematical functions are needed to study water variable forecasting (such as sediment, dam or lake water levels, water velocity, stream flow, rainfall-runoff, ET, and other factors). These mathematical functions and hybrid models often use AI algorithms to process the data. AI algorithms can offer an opportunity to analyze Agriculture 2024, 14, 1141 30 of 40 historical and real-time data sets to predict the water demand for present and future irrigation scenarios. This prediction can help with the more precise planning of the water supply. Additionally, intelligent irrigation systems can precisely adjust the amount of water supplied based on various variables such as soil moisture, crop status, vegetation index, and irrigation strategy, automatically acting on automation elements. It can allow for exact irrigation scheduling, delivering the precise amount of water the plants need at the right time by reducing under-watering or over-watering. AI algorithms can predict future climate change patterns and water requirements. They can help farmers plan irrigation schedules proactively, ensuring they have enough water during dry periods and avoiding unnecessary watering during the wet season. AI algorithms can monitor irrigation infrastructure for leaks and inefficiencies, preventing significant water loss. AI algorithms can schedule irrigation to avoid peak electricity hours, reducing energy use. In conclusion, AI is revolutionizing irrigation practices by enabling a shift from traditional, static irrigation schedules to dynamic, data-driven irrigation management. This transformation leads to significant water savings, improved crop yields, and increased sustainability in the agricultural sector. AI algorithms enable automated production processes, optimize resource utilization, and reduce human intervention. The potential of AI applications to significantly improve water resource management, help to enhance soil fertility, protect biodiversity, and optimize water management for sustainable agriculture is evident. AI tools can efficiently optimize soil productivity and water resources by recording and forecasting water demands, installing infrastructure, and monitoring and predicting coming disasters. Also, these efficient natural resources monitoring capabilities help to attain the proposed task of the Goals for Water—2030 [221–225]. 3.6. Future Prospects of PISs/SISs The future of PISs seems bright, driven by the need for efficient irrigation water management systems, technological advancements, and increasing environmental awareness.
