World Development 160 (2022) 106067 12 as control districts; ii) districts where such demonstrations were conducted in only one year between 2012 and 2017 (Allahabad, Ambedkar Nagar, Hathras, and Varanasi); iii) districts where such demonstrations were conducted in any two years between 2012 and 2017 (Bhadohi and Mathura); iv) districts where such demon- strations were conducted in any three years between 2012 and 2017 (Auraiya); and (v) districts where such demonstrations were conducted in any four years between 2012 and 2017 (Etah). We esti- mate the following speciﬁcation to examine the association between frontline demonstrations and the adoption of HD-2967 at the district level. Note that we cannot interpret the estimates of this speciﬁca- tion as causal; the speciﬁcation presents the trends across demon- stration and non-demonstration districts.

Y takes a value of 1 if a farmer adopts wheat variety HD-2967, and 0 otherwise. FLD  D takes a value of 1 if frontline demonstrations were conducted in any of the years in dis- trict d between 2012 and 2017 and 0 if not (control districts). The coefﬁcient of interest, a3; estimates the difference in adoption rates of HD-2967 across frontline demonstration and non-frontline demonstration districts. We cluster the standard errors at the district-time level. The difference between demonstration and non-demonstration districts between 2014–15 and 2017–18 is insigniﬁcant (see Table 9, Column 1). To gain further insights, we exploit the variation in the imple- mentation of frontline demonstrations at the district level and run the following variants of Eq. (7) to compare control districts with i) districts where frontline demonstrations were conducted four times between 2012 and 2017; ii) districts where such demonstrations were conducted three times between 2012 and 2017; iii) districts where such demonstrations were conducted twice between 2012 and 2017; and iv) districts where such demonstrations were conducted once between 2012 and 2017. The results are presented in Table 9 in Columns 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Districts where frontline demonstrations were con- ducted four and three times between 2012 and 2017 saw signiﬁ- cantly higher adoption of HD-2967 (8 % and 5 %, respectively) than control districts. Interestingly, the results are insigniﬁcant in districts where frontline demonstrations were conducted once or twice between 2012 and 2017.
