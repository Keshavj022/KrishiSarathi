 Therefore, there is a broad area of research in direction of more pharmacological activities of plant and use their properties like antimicrobial and insect repellent properties in organic farming to reducing the input cost in agriculture.

January–February 2022 21 K L Kumawat*, Anil Sharma, W H Raja, O C Sharma and J I Mir Technology T he agro-climatic conditions of the Himalayan region in the country offer tremendous possibility for the production of temperate fruit crops. Accordingly, the area under the temperate fruit crops is growing rapidly and contributing to economic, nutritional, and employment security. Kashmir valley is most suitable for temperate fruit production in particular apple, almond and walnut due to its plain and fertile land, and productivity data also show the same. As per the available data, Jammu and Kashmir is way ahead in productivity of apple (11.43 MT/ha) compared to other major apple-growing states i.e. Himachal Pradesh (3.96 MT/ha), Uttarakhand (2.32 MT/ha). Further, Kashmir enjoys a monopoly in the production of almonds (94.4%), walnut (91.9%), and cherry in India. However, the large portion of temperate fruits crops area of Kashmir is under rainfed conditions. Unlike other temperate regions, Kashmir is devoid of monsoon rains (June-September) and January to May is the rainy season, but a large proportion of precipitation is received in winter in the form of snow. Thus, snowfall plays a crucial role in the successful production of temperate fruit crops. But in the last few years, fruit orchards were hit by heavy and untimely snowfall. Pre-and post-winter snowfall considerably affected the temperate fruit industry of Kashmir. Post-winter snowfall March snowfall-2015: During 2015, heavy snowfall happened twice during March (8th and 16th) which resulted in blossom damage in the almond crop. Low temperature followed by snowfall reduced bee activity and consequently resulted in low fruit set. April snowfall-2017: Untimely snowfall during 6th April 2017 badly affected stone fruits including apricot, peach, plum, and cherry which were in full bloom. Snowfall resulted in a considerable dip in temperature on snowfall days i.e. average temperate was 2°C, compared to 12°C during 2015 and 2016. Moreover, the effect of snowfall on temperature remained for a week. The mean weekly higher, average and low temperature after snowfall during 2017 was 14.71, 8.86 and 2.86 which were respectively 20.57, 13.86, 7.29 and 16, 11.71 and 7.29°C during 2015 and 2016.
