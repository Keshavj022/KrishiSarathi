 So far 11 such plots were laid out under high- density planting system with a spacing of 6 m × 4 m and 5 m × 5 m. High-yielding varieties, viz. Ullal 4, Vengurle 4, NDR 2-1, Goa 11/6 and H 3/4 were distributed for this purpose. The plots are being monitored regularly. At present the plots are under second and third years of maintenance. CASHEW NUT SHELLER A cam type, pedal-operated, cashew nut sheller has been developed to overcome the drudgery experienced in presently used hand-cum-pedal- operated sheller. l Forecasting models have been worked out for India as well for different cashew-growing states in the country. l A total of 102,212 grafts were produced and distributed to different govern- ments, NGOs and farmers by NRCC, Puttur. Cashew grown in high-density planting IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF HORTICULTURAL CROPS 67 an yield of 1.6 tonnes/ha at a spacing of 5 m × 5 m with 75% thinning at RFRS, Vengurla. Unmated males and virgin females of CSRB showed higher response to extracts and volatiles collected from cashew bark, frass and exuded gum. Evaluation of efficacy of new insecticides against TMB showed that Cartap hydrochloride (0.075%) was effective and comparable with carbaryl (0.1%). It was found that cashew kernel baby bits coated with sugar and different flavours could be stored without any quality deterioration up to 8 months. Cashew apple pomace could be blended with cereals and pulses up to 10% without affecting quality in terms of in-vitro digestibility of protein and starch. SPICES About 153 accessions of Piper spp., 26 of Elettaria spp., 21 of Zingiber spp., 19 of Garcinia spp., 9 of Myristica spp., 2 of Cinnamomum spp., 1 of Syzygium sp. and 3 of Vanilla spp., were added to germplasm conservatories. A database of black pepper germplasm was brought out in a CD. RAPD profiles were developed in 13 species of Piper, 4 of Zingiber and 12 cultivars and 6 species of Curcuma. A RAPD based molecular marker technique was developed in black pepper for identification of true hybrids. The Acc. 239 was identified as a promising line in black pepper. In cardamom, high-yielding (Acc. 8-4 D 11 and Acc. 7-24 D 11) and drought tolerant (CL 668, P 6, D 237, 2-2 D 11) accessions were identified. V3 S1-8 in ginger and PTS 59 and PTS 55 in turmeric were identified as promising lines. These are in an advanced stage of release. Ginger V1 E8-2 and turmeric PTS 43, TCP 1 and TCP 2 were proposed for release. Turmeric Alleppey and BDJR 1260 were selected for high curcumin content and yield. The exotic line of coriander, EC 2-32666, was identified as the best for leaf type. The highest volatile oil content (4.4%) in cumin EC 232684 was recorded. Acc. 5302 of pepper was found to be promising with 8.0% oil, 19.0% oleoresin and 3.7% piperine. Ginger, Acc. 197, was promising with 2.5% oil, 7.0% oleoresin and 2.8% fibre. Nutmeg, Acc. A9/18, had maximum oil in nut (16.5%) and mace (26.1%). Acc. 828 of pepper was tolerant. M.
