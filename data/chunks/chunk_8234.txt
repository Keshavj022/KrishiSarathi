Pre-breeding for improvement in soybean: Soybean has very narrow genetic base and use of accessions with unique marker alleles in hybridization would help broadening its genetic base. Genotyping of 90 soybean accessions with 16 SSR markers identified three accessions (IC 15541, IC 18743 and IC 24057) with unique alleles. Use of such type of un-adopted diverse materials often result in introduction of undesirable characters like pod- shattering. CAPS marker analysis of pod-shattering resistance gene (PDh1) has identified shattering and pod-shattering resistant loci in 90 accessions, corresponding to shattering phenotype. Eight parent based multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) population was developed by employing 2-way, 4-way and 8-way inter-cross hybridizations to gain more variability and for capturing diversity from China, USA and Brazil. The nested association mapping population was developed, consisting of twenty cross combinations for achieving drought, waterlogging and rust resistance in soybean.
