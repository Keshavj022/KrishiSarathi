 Pea IC642003 21221 Resistant to powdery mildew disease Pea IC642307 22087 Extra early genotype of vegetable pea (Pisum sativum var. hortense). Synchronous maturity, thus suitable for single picking or Mechanical harvesting and Multiple cropping. H-88-78-1 (IC644011; INGR22049) VRT-2-3-1 (IC637249; INGR21150) VRT-12-1-3-2 (IC640702; INGR21149) VRT-6-1-4 (IC637252; INGR21151) VRT4-55-20 (IC637253; INGR21216) done 70-75 days after sowing. Pods are 8-9 cm in length, green in colour and slightly curved having 8-9 seeds/pod. Average yield/plant is 176-190 g and shelling per cent is 48-49. This genetic stock can be used for future breeding programme for higher number of pods and yield. Multiple Disease Resistant Pea (VRP-147): VRP- 147 is a late maturing genotype registered with NBPGR (INGR15028) for powdery mildew, downy mildew and rust resistance. First flower appears on 16-17th node and 50% flowering occurs in 65-66 days after sowing. Average pod length and width is 5.5 cm and 1.42 cm, respectively. Pods are green in colour and slightly curved. Average number of pods/plant is 24.5 and 10 pod weight is 44 g. Each pod has 6.2 seed. Yield/plant is 98 g and shelling per cent is around 47.2. The total sugar is 3.80%. flowering. The plant height of VRP-500 varies from 130- 137 cm with an average of 134.7 cm. First picking can be March–April 2023 49 Multiple Disease Resistant Pea (VRP-343): VRP-343 is also late maturing genotype having multiple resistance for powdery mildew, downy mildew and rust (Registration No. INGR15029). First flower can be seen after 13 to14th node and plants takes 59-60 days for 50% flowering. Average pod length is 6.10 cm while, width of pod is around 1.36 cm. Pods are green in colour and slightly curved. Average number of pods/plant is 26.4 and each pods is having 6.5 seed. The weight of 10 pods is 42 g. Yield/plant is 110 g and shelling per cent is around 46.5. The total sugar is 3.15%. Multiple Disease Resistant Pea (VRP-147) Multiple Disease Resistant Pea (VRP-343) VRPM-901-5 (INGR19077): The newly bred ‘VRPM- 901-5’ is a mid-season pea genotype capable of producing 3-5 flowers/pods at multiple flowering nodes. This genotype was developed by using single plant selection approach from a cross ‘VL-8 × PC-. The first multi- flowering node appears on average 21st node. This genotype is characterized with higher number of primary branches/plant (2 to 7) and high reproductive nodes/plant (on average 18.9). Pods are 7.5-9 cm in length and light green in colour. VRPM–901–5, appeared most promising for pod yield per plant (208 g). This genotype had showed yield potential up to 290 g/plant, almost 2.5 times the existing cultivars. This genotype is very promising for high pod yield and can also be used as parents for any breeding program aimed at incorporating multi-flowering trait in garden-pea.
