 Seed inoculation of pulse crops with Rhizobium and PSB bio-fertilizer each @ 20g/kg seed. Nutrient management: 25:50:25:20 Kg/ha (NPKS) as basal dose should be given on sowing time. Nipping must be done 35 to 45 days after sowing. Water Management: Chickpea is mostly sown as rainfed crop in. However, where irrigation facilities are available, a pre-sowing irrigation should be given. It will ensure proper germination and good crop growth. If winter rains fail, give one irrigation at pre- flowering stage and one at pod development stage. A light irrigation should be given because heavy irrigation is always harmful to chickpea crop. Weed management: One hand weeding or inter culture with hand hoe or wheel hoe after 25-30 days and second after 60 days of sowing. fluchloralin 1 Kg per hectare in 800-1000 liters of water as pre-planting spray may be used for affective weed control. Insect Pests management: For management of Pod Borer spray spinosad 45 SC @ 0.1 ml/lit or indoxacarb 14.5 SC @ 0.3 ml/Lit or quinolphos @ 1.5 Liter/ha or flubendiamide 48 SC 0.1 ml/lit or Novacuron 10 EC 1 ml/lit of water. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 191 Disease management: For management of Wilt treat the seed before sowing with Tricodarma 5gm + carboxsin 1 gm/Kg seeds and benlate or mixture of benlate of thiram (1:1) at the rate of 2.5 g per kg Seed. Rouge out the infected plants from the field. Grow resistant cultivars such as Pusa 372, BG1053, HK94-134, DCP92- 3and GCP-105. It generally appears after 3 weeks of sowing. Crop rotation should be maintained for 3 years. Lentil Lentil is one of the important pulse crops which is grown as rain- fed farming. Manure and fertilizers: If available about 25 to 50 q of well decomposed organic manure like FYM or compost should be incorporated in case of very light soils at the time of land preparation. Apply 25:50:25:20 Kg/ha (NPKS) to support optimum growth and yield. Improved varieties: HUL 57; WBL77; KLS 218; PL 406; IPL 406; Mallik (K75); Arun (PL77-12); PL639; Narendra Masur-1; Shiwalik (L4076); BR25 and BR26. Seed rate: The optimum seed rate for normal crop is 30 kg/ha. Seed rate should be increased to 40 kg/ha in case of late sowing. Seed treatment: Treat the seed with carbendazim 50WP @ 2g/kg seed followed by T. viride @ 8-10 g/kg to control wilt. Sowing time and method of sowing: The crop may be sown between 15 October to 15 November. The crop should be sown in lines at 25 x 8 cm. Irrigation requirement: The crop is mostly grown in rainfed areas. It can tolerate drought condition to some extent. It requires 1-2 irrigations depending upon the rains during the growing season. First irrigation should be given 25 to 30 DAS while second should be given 40-45 DAS. Weed management: Lentil being slow in growth in early stage, suffers adversely from competition with weeds. The period from ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 192 30 to 60 days after sowing is most crucial for competition with weeds.
