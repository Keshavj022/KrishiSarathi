 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Swelling of shoulder There was significant reduction in the swelling as well as pain in shoulder in all the animals and the swelling score became 1 on day 7 and 0 on day 21, but it decreased to 1 on day 7 and 0 on day 14 (Table 1). Table 1. Score sheet for shoulder swelling at IVRI MASFSU The field trials were carried out on clinical cases of bullocks suffering with swelling of shoulder region and swelling of limb or joint. These clinical cases were randomly divided into four groups consisting of 10 animals in each group. The site of swelling in the neck, shoulder region and limb or joint was thoroughly scrubbed and washed with soap and water, and mopped with cloth before application of medicament in groups I, II, III and IV respectively. Clinical observations pertaining to pain and swelling were recorded on day 0 before the application of ointment and subsequently on days 7, 14, 21 and 30. The observation pertaining to swelling was recorded by measuring with vernier calipers and graded as 0= no swelling, 1= mild swelling, 2= moderate swelling and 3= severe swelling. The Parameter Day 0 7 14 21 30 Swelling (score) Pain (score) 2 2 1 1 1 0 - - Swelling of shoulder region Ten cases of swelling of neck were assessed, which showed moderate to severe inflammation in group I. The average score was 2.1 ± 0.13 on day 0. Application of ITK ointment revealed reduction in swelling and mean score on days 7, 14, 21 and 30 as 1.3+0.13, 1.0+0.16, 0.6 and 0.5+0.2 respectively. Statistically the treatment revealed linearly declined trend, and on day 30 the inflammation at the site was minimum. However, in the animals of group II, which were treated with iodine ointment, swelling score was Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Table 2.

There was linear regular decline in trend of swelling on days 7, 14, 21 and 30 (Tables 2 and 3, Fig. 2). Swellings of joints and limbs A reduction in mean scores of swelling of joints and limbs was observed. The mean scores of pain decreased after the application of ITK on the affected part. The pain score that was 2.0 on day 0 decreased to 0 on day 21 after treatment (Table 3). There was gradual improvement in weight-bearing scores, and on day 21 after treatment it was 2.86. The treated animals also revealed gradual improvement in weight-bearing scores, and on day 21 after treatment it was 3.4 (Table 4). Overall, 16 animals were treated and 8 animals recovered up to a period of 28 days. Of all the recovered animals, 3 recovered within 2 weeks and 2 within 3 weeks (Table 3).
