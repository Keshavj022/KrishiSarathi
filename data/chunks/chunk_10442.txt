The cotton seed crushing and oil extraction technologies helped increase in cottonseed oil production to about 1.4 Mt in 2020. It is contributing approximately 12-13% to the total domestic vegetable oil production with savings of about Rs 117 billion of foreign exchange. It has further scope of increase by 20% over the current level with adoption of scientific processing methods developed by the ICAR. The annual cotton stalk biomass production is 25 Mt which can be converted into value- added products by improving supply chain logistics. ICAR-CIRCOT has developed a viable logistics model for supply of cotton stalks to industries which comprises of uprooting of cotton stalk, sun drying and shredding. The chipped cotton stalk can viably be transported to industries within the radius of 50 km. This model proved promising and adopted by farmers’ groups in Maharashtra and Gujarat with average earning of about Rs. 5 lakhs @ Rs 1000/ton per season. Presently, about 10-15 lakh tons chipped cotton stalks are being supplied mainly to pelleting and briquetting industries. It is generating about 1 lakh man- days employment in rural India and Rs 100-150 crore additional income to farmers. A technology developed for preparation of premium grade pellets from cotton stalks using local binders in different proportions is also available. The premium grade cotton stalks pellets have 4150 kcal kg-1 heating value, less than 5% ash content and over 99% durability index and are also about 25-30% cheaper than saw dust pellets. To facilitate use of high ash cotton biomass pellets, ICAR-CIRCOT has developed specialized pellet stove and this stove and cotton biomass pellets are being used by several stakeholders. 5.4.4. Jute and allied fibres India is the largest producer and consumer of jute in the world with 85% production used to meet domestic demand. The Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987 makes it compulsory to use jute fibres for stacking in packing commodities. The pioneering work of ICAR-NINFET Kolkata on jute diversified products (JDP) and finer fibres with higher strength are in high demand for producing value-added products of jute. The JDPs are the area of future growth of jute industry. India’s share in global exports of raw jute was 4.9% in 2018.
