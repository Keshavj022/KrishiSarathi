 Assessment of performance of indigenous and improved practices of rice cultivation by matrix scoring Parameter ITK Improved practice practice Availability of seed 10 2 Tolerance to water stress 8 4 Pest control 10 4 Requirement of 4 additional nutrients Liking of farmers 10 4 Yield 6 8 superior to improved practices as per the scoring done by the respondents. Except yield, the indigenous practice was found superior for all the parameters to the improved pratices. Experiment The yield parameters and economics of rice through different cultivation practices are given in Table 2. Yield and yield attributes The highest number of tillers (458/m 2 ) was recorded in the improved practice, followed by 324 tillers/m 2 under indigenous practice (Table 2). The improved practice produced 29% and 53% more tillers than indigenous practice and control respectively. Similarly, indigenous practice produced 33.3% higher number of tillers/m 2 than than the control (216/m 2 ). Highest number of insect infestation (46/m 2 ) Table 2. Yield attributes, yield and economics of indigenous and improved practices of rice cultivation Treatment Tiller/ m 2 Insect infestation/ m 2 Yield (q/ha) Net return Return/rupee (Rs/ha) spent Control 216 46 12.2 (â€“) 180 - Indigenous practice 324 7 22.8 5,180 1.61 Improved practice 458 5 24.6 6,240 1.71 CD (P=0.05) 47.69 3.24 4.21 1,027 0.23 CROPS AND CROPPING SYSTEMS was recorded under control treatment and the lowest under improved practice (5/m2). There was no difference in number of insect infested plant either due to adoption of improved practice or indigenous practice of insect-pest control. Highest grain yield (24.6 q/ha) was recorded under improved practice, followed by 22.8 q/ha under indigenous rice cultivation practice, which was only 7.3% higher than with the indigenous rice-cultivation practice. The improved practice and indigenous practice both were, however, statistically at par in respect to grain yield, they gave double the grain yield than the control (12.2 q/ha). Highest net return (Rs 6,240/ha) was obtained in improved practice, which was 17% higher than the net return (Rs 5,180/ha) obtained under indigenous practice. The highest return/rupee spent (Rs 1.71/Re) was recorded under improved practice, which was Rs 1.61/Re under indigenous practice. CONCLUSION On the basis of the data of the experimentation as well as field study, it was concluded that the performance of indigenous practice of rice cultivation was equal to the improved practice.  CROPS AND CROPPING SYSTEMS Code : 677 Title of the ITK : Method of snow melting Description of the ITK : In Spiti valley of Himachal Pradesh farmers adopt a traditional method for snow melting. For sowing barley early, farmers spread ash over the field for melting snow. Ash is having such properties to melt snow fast. This is in practice for several years.
