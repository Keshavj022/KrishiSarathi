For instance, iron enrichment during germination with 0.05–2 g/L ferrous sulphate increased the iron concentration in germinated brown rice by 1.1–15.6% relative to that in ungermi- nated brown rice [106]. Ramli also conﬁrmed this and suggested that zinc levels in the range of 25–75 mg/L might meet the recommended daily intake. The maximal zinc bioavailability (26.31%) was attained when GBR25 was germinated for 28 hrs. In addition, germination would boost parboiled rice’s total phenolic content and antioxidant activity [107]. The enhancement of phenolic content can be accomplished by soaking in a ﬂoral extract rich in phenolics. Based on the total phenolics fortiﬁcation of various rice varieties with butterﬂy pea (Clitoria ternatea) ﬂower extract by parboiling, it was determined that the composition of rice inﬂuences the absorption and ﬁxation of phenolic compounds. The parboiling procedure identiﬁes milled rice with low amylose for maximum phenolic enrichment [108]. 7. Health Beneﬁts Parboiling consists of soaking rice kernels in warm water to increase the solubility of nutrients in the rice bran, followed by steaming to transport these nutrients from the bran to the endosperm [109]. Given the difference in nutritional content as described in Section 3, it has been suggested that brown rice (BR) should be preferred in meals due to its numerous health beneﬁts. One of the essential health beneﬁts of parboiled rice is the alteration of the starch during processing. Parboiled rice is known for lowering blood glucose levels for both healthy people and people with diabetes type 2 [110]. The process of parboiling rice improved the smooth morphology of its carbohydrates, which Agriculture 2023, 13, 1390 16 of 24 may be responsible for its resistance to digestion.
