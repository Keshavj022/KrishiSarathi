 In addition to improving the fruitâ€™s appearance by enhancing skin colour and minimizing blemishes, bagging is a physical protection technique that can alter the microenvironment for fruit development, which can have a number of positive effects on the internal quality of the fruit. Fruit cracking, insect pest and/or mechanical damage, sunburned skin, disease incidence and bird damage can all be reduced with pre- harvest fruit bagging. Bagging is laborious and costly, benefit ratio must be investigated in order to promote adoption of the method in much of the World. The purpose of this article is to communicate the advantages of fruit bagging so that commercial growers may think about implementing this technique. The primary goal of fruit bagging is to protect the fruit from different external factors that can adversely affect its quality and marketability. These factors include pests, insects, diseases, adverse weather conditions, physical damage and exposure to excessive sunlight. By providing a protective barrier, fruit bags effectively reduce the risk of fruit infestation and damage, ensuring a higher yield of unblemished and visually appealing fruits. Moreover, fruit bagging helps to promote uniform fruit colour, size, and shape, which are crucial factors for consumer preference and market demand. The controlled environment within the fruit bag helps in optimizing the ripening process, allowing the fruit to attain a desirable colour, texture, and taste. This technique is especially beneficial for fruit crops such as apple, pear, peach, citrus fruits, mango, grapes, guava, etc. Fruit Bagging Techniques Fruit bagging can be carried out using various materials, depending on the specific requirements of the crop and grower preferences. Common materials include paper bags, plastic bags, fabric bags and netting. The choice of material is crucial, as it impacts factors like moisture retention, air circulation, and light penetration, all of which can influence fruit development. Necessity of Fruit Bagging Pest and Disease Management One of the primary reasons for adopting fruit bagging is the effective protection it offers against pests and diseases. Many insects and pathogens can wreak havoc on fruit crops, causing significant damage and reduced yields. Fruit bagging serves as a physical barrier, preventing direct contact between pests and the fruit. Common pests such as fruit flies, codling moths, and birds are unable to penetrate the barrier, thus protecting the fruit from external damage and infestation. Moreover, fruit bagging also shields fruits from environmental factors like wind and rain, which encourages the spread of fungal diseases. This also reduces pesticide usage which leads to a more sustainable and eco-friendly approach to fruit production. The bagging of fruits using brown paper bags before 6-9 weeks of harvesting in guava and 30 days before harvesting in mango reduced the incidence of fruit fly.
