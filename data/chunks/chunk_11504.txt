 For the management of soil borne diseases Trichoderma culture@ 5 kg/hectare mixed with vermicompost must be applied in the soil before sowing. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 324 Seed treatment must be done with Thiophanate-methyl + Pyroclostrobin 2 ml + 1.0-gram Boron+ 1.0-gram Molybdenum along with 5-gram Rhizobium and 5-gram PSB culture. Organic seed treatment should be done with 5 gram Trichoderma culture + 5 gram Rhizobium and 5 gram PSB culture. For the management of Pod borers, placing of 50 Bird perchers, 10 Pheroman Traps and 1 Light Trap per hectare. In the initial stage of pest infestation application of 750 ml Bacillus thuringiensis,500 ml NPV,750 ml Metarhizium anisopliae and 1 lit./hectare Beauveria bassiana must be done. Linseed Crop Linseed Use of high yielding multiple resistant varieties viz., JLS 66, JLS 73, JLS 95, RLC 148, RLC 164 under rainfed and JLS 79 RLC 167 under irrigated condition Seed should be treated with suitable fungicides Carbendazim 2g + Mancozed 1g and Imidacloprid 48 FS @ 1.25 ml/kg seed or by Trichoderma virdae @ 10 g/kg seed followed by PSB and Azatobactor @ 10g /kg seed for better germination and vigour. Seed rate less than 30 kg and 25 kg should be used under rainfed and irrigated condition respectively. Dry sowing followed by irrigated is more effective for better germination and plant stand. Fertilizers should be applied at 80:40:20: 20:5 and 40:20:20: 10:5 N: P: K: S: Zn is recommended under irrigated and rainfed condition respectively. For the management of weed metsulfuron methyl 4g a.i. + clodinophop 60g /1.25 ha land is effective against weed management at 2-3 leaf stage or 18-20 days after sowing. Mechanical weeding dora, kulfa, cycle or hand weeding is also effective for better aeration of the plant and earthling up. Foliar spray of N: P: K: 19:19:19 along with fungicide and insecticide at vegetative stage is effective for better growth of the crop and plant protection. Combine harvester under low RPM and ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 325 reaper cum binder may also use for harvesting of the crop in term of minimizing laborers cost. Mustard Varieties recommended for MP state are, Pusa Tarak, Pusa Mahak, Pusa Agrani and Pusa Aditya Soil and field preparation: Well drained, light soil, sandy loam, or light loam. Fine firm moist seedbed is required for this pre-sowing irrigation is required. Sowing time- Sowing time is most important it should be maintained. The best time is mid-October to mid-November. Delay sowing should be avoided as incidence of Aphid (insect) cause damage to crop. Seed rate and thinning: Use 5 kg seed/ha, sow the seed behind the deshi plough in line or with the help of seed drill machine at 30 cm row to row distance. To maintain the plant population in field, plant thinning operation after 15-20 days after sowing is needed.
