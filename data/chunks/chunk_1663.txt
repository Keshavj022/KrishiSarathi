 During 46 days of rearing period, larval survival was achieved up to 61.3 % at lowest stocking density (300 m-3). Hilsa was cultured in two ponds of 0.1 ha each at 15,000 and 30,000/ha stocking density, where fish grew to 134.71 mm/ 24.63 g and 119.7 mm/14.64 g from the initial size of 29. mm/0.27 g during 300 days of culture period. Hilsa fry could be weaned to accept artificial feed under pond culture condition. Transportation trial of eggs and larvae of hilsa revealed that the survival of eggs and larvae at 100 and 50 nos./ litre were 80 and 98%, respectively. After 31 months of culture, hilsa attained average growth of 83.80±27.38g/ 339.33±9.68 mm from initial body weight/length of 1.37±0.18 g / 52.97±5.50 mm. Significant number of matu- red female (358.18g-425.52g/352mm-370mm) with V-stage of oocyte maturation and matured male (139.35g/260 mm) in the cultured pond were found during October-November and January-February after 2 years of culture indicating possibility of brood stock maturation in captivity. The study also revealed that the main reason for decline of hilsa, is increased overfishing and altered flow regime. It was observed that 100 or 110mm mesh gillnet for hilsa fishing should be followed for harvesting of fishes. Decision Support System for enhancing water productivity of irrigated rice- wheat cropping system: Four year o f experimentation concluded that the S y s t e m o f R i c e I n t e n s i f i c a t i o n ( SRI) and D i r e c t S e e d e d R i c e ( DSR) methods of rice cultivation resulted in higher grain yield and saving of water as compared to puddled method. Further the crop simulation models, viz. AquaCrop and CERES- rice and wheat modules of DSSAT were calibrated and validated for all experimented rice and wheat cultivars under different rice cultivation methods and irrigation regimes and the water production functions were developed. The data acquired from field experiments were used as background data base for the development of water productivity decision support system for RWCS (WPDSS- RW).The developed DSS was operated with input data of different cultivars, cultivation methods, rainfall depths etc. for different locations to generate scenarios of grain yield under different irrigation depths, water productivity, water saving and consequent increase in the groundwater table information for enhancing water productivity of the study region. Harvesting of hilsa 47 Salient Achievements of the Projects Decision Support System for enhancing productivity of grapes under moisture and temperature stress conditions: Vitis Mod, a grape simulation model (beta version) is developed. It is a process based model designed to run at daily step and it can simulate the growth, development and yield of grape. It has a modular structure with modules to simulate phenology, canopy, dry matter partitioning, yield, stress of water and temperature on growth and yield.
