 Among the system, the maximum additional net returns was received with greengram - mustard + berseem (`46,300/ha) followed by paddy - mustard + berseem (`37,900/ha), pearl millet - mustard + berseem (`34,300/ha) and lowest with fallow - mustard + berseem (`29,000/ha). Higher net returns with relay berseem was owing to improve soil fertility and ability of the soil to absorb rainwater and supply it to crops. Also the higher B:C ratio was received with pearl millet, paddy and greengram based mustard relayed berseem compared to without relayed berseem. Total water-use The TWU in all cropping systems was higher with relay cropping than without relay cropping (Table 2). The maximum TWU with relay cropping was recorded with paddy - mustard + berseem (1141 mm/ha) followed by paddy - mustard (961 mm/ha), pearl millet - mustard + berseem (770 mm/ ha), greengram - mustard + berseem (703 mm/ha), pearl millet - mustard (565 mm/ha), greengram - mustard (495 mm/ha), fallow - mustard + berseem (362 mm/ha) and least with fallow-mustard (182 mm/ha). Water productivity The rainy season crop-based mustard relayed berseem cropping system increased WP from 5.5 to 13.2% as compared to without relay cropping (Table 2). The variations of WP due to higher yield advantage of relay cropping were due to constant soil moisture availability which supports the concept of better soil moisture environment. Overall WP of the system was maximum increased by 13.2% with paddy - mustard + berseem followed by greengram - mustard + berseem (6.5%) and lowest by pearl millet - mustard + berseem (5.5%), whereas decreased by 18.8% with fallow- mustard + berseem as compared without relay cropping. Physicochemical properties The positive changes in soil organic carbon (OC) and available macronutrients (N, P, K, and S) were observed, while electrical conductivity (EC) and pH were decreased with relay cropping as compared to without relay cropping showed systems (Table 3). The crop establishment with relay cropping showed slight decrease in EC (0.09–0.13 dS/m) and pH by 0.13–0.17 as compared with without relay cropping systems. The maximum additions of available macro-nutrients were 24–36 kg N, 1.8–2.1 kg P, 17–24 kg K and 1.8–2.2 kg S/ha as compared to without relay cropping. The nutrients accumulated due to retention of higher amounts of berseem residue (1.85–2.01 tonne residue/ha/year) rich in plant nutrients. Impact on technology adoption The results presented in Table 4 indicate that the diversification of mustard-based cropping with relay cropping berseem in mustard crop improved soil fertility resulting in improvement in grain yield and additional benefits. The berseem seed production increased income of farmers and also acted as flora for honey bees. This practice is supporting dairying and beekeeping enterprises.
