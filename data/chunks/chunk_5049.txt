 Spraying of Cynodon dactylon extract three times at 15 days interval starting from flowering stage reduced the fruit damage caused by Fig. 3.

However, Endosulfan 35EC at 0.07% gave the maximum control of the pest. There was no difference in the yield of healthy tomato in both Cynodon dactylon and Endosulfan treated plots. METHODOLOGY Location Indian Institute of Horticultural Research Bangalore. PRA and field study Unstructured interview was conducted and information were obtained on the methods and use of the ITK. Experiment A field experiment was conducted with 3 treatments, viz., (i) Chemical- Chlorothalonil, Hostothion and Imidacloprid spray, (ii) Spray of Cynodon dactylon extract _ 15 days interval till harvest, and (iii) Control _ No spray. Tomato (Variety PKM-1) was taken in 100 m2 plots. Extract of Cynodon dactylon which was used as one of the treatments was prepared in the following way: 1 kg grass was soaked in 12 litre water. Eight litre extract was obtained after 24 hours of soaking. Observations on wilt, leaf curl, early blight, fruit rot, leaf miner, borer and yield were recorded. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Experiment Observations on the incidence of wilt, leaf curl, early blight,fruit rot, leaf miner, borer and yield were recorded. Data presented in Table 2 give the results on different disease parameters observed with the three treatments. The results obtained indicated that Cynodon dactylon soaked water is effective in the management of pests in tomato. It was also observed that it is effective against wilt and root rots. The observations recorded have shown a reduction in the incidence of wilt, leaf curl, early blight, borer and leaf miner in Cynodon dactylon treated plots as compared to untreated control. However, yield of tomato was similar in all the 3 treatments. CONCLUSION Reduced incidence of pests and diseases was observed both at Coimbatore and Bangalore with the use of Cynodon dactylon soaked water in tomato as claimed by the discloser.

HORTICULTURAL CROPS Code :1416 Title of the ITK :Control of insect-pest by spraying starch, animal urine and dusting of cowdung ash in vegetables Description of the ITK : The sticky nature of starch and uric acid of animal urine helps in killing the insects. Dusting of cowdung ash helps in control of biting and chewing type insects specially aphids. Rice starch and animal urine are spread on vegetable plants.
