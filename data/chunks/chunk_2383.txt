 The Depreciation has been calculated for the current year on the basis of closing balance of Fixed Assets (except on Land & Livestock) as per Straight Line Method at rates prescribed under the Companies Act, 1956. The original value and the accumulated depreciation on the disposed off assets have been suitably incorporated in Schedule 5. 5. In the previous years, the sponsored projects were treated as a part of Earmarked Funds and exhibited in Schedule 3 (Earmarked/ Endowment Funds). As they do not have the characteristics of Earmarked funds (except that they are earmarked for specific objectives, this was changed in the Accounts of 2014-15 and the balances of Sponsored Projects (net of expenditure) have been distinctly shown under Current Liabilities in Schedule-4, to be in accordance with “item 12-Sponsored Projects” in the Significant Accounting Policies (Schedule 22). The units continue to depict the same regarding “Sponsored Projects”. 6. In the previous years, there was a separate head “Reserves” in the Balance Sheet, supported by Schedule 2. Values of Gifted Assets, Assets created out of Sponsored Project funds less Depreciation for the year on such assets, were added to this fund. As the concept of Capital Reserve in not relevant for autonomous organizations, they have been directly credited to Capital Fund and the depreciation on these assets, along with the depreciation on the other assets is debited to the Income & Expenditure Account, in the accounts for the year 2015-16. 7.
