 There is complementarity between farmer’s own conservation measures and community level interventions (such as those undertaken through programs such as IWMP), as well as conservation measures implemented by neighboring farmers. The influence of community level conservation activities and neighborhood SWC practices is more pro­ nounced in case of rainfed crops (such as maize) compared to the irri­ gated crops (such as paddy). Long-lasting technological intervention including contour bunding, afforestation and slope-leveling are necessary to arrest and prevent future erosion. In addition to community/watershed level conservation measures, the policy intervention could be in terms of encouraging farmers to undertake farm-level SWC measures for own benefits as well as for creating positive externalities in the neighborhood. Apart from providing incentives for implementing SWC measures, other policy in­ terventions could include setting-up model farms with location specific SWC measures implemented that could serve as role-models for the neighbors. In sum, the adoption of multiple SWC measures may be essential for farming in rainfed ecosystems. The government investment in developing infrastructure to neutralize soil erosion through water­ shed programme complements the farmers’ adoption of conservation measures. Implementing multiple farm level SWC measures through sustainable agricultural practices not only improves farmer’s income but also helps in sustaining the agricultural ecosystem.
