The Overall Methodology carried out in this research study presented in Fig. 2. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Assessing Hydrochemistry of the parameters In the analysis of 94 water samples with different physical parame­ ters like pH, EC, and TDS, and chemical cations parameters like Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+, and anions parameters like HCO3–, Cl−, SO4 2−, NO3−, and F−and are presented in (Table 3). 3.1.1. Distribution of physical parameters The pH scale, which measures the degree of acidity or alkaline a given groundwater sample, pH is a crucial parameter for assessing quality of water and determining its suitability for an irrigation use (Lkr et al., 2020). The pH concentration fluctuates from 7.12 to 8.28, with a mean concertation of 7.59 in the study area. Permissible pH value varies from 6.5 to 8.5 (WHO 2017). All samples are in the safe limits indicating slightly alkaline nature. pH above 8.5 rises the carbonate concentration in soils, causing rise in soil sodium concentration (Sodicity) (Bauder et al 2011; Aravinthasamy et al., 2020). According to Hem (1985), EC is commonly used to measure the ionic concentration of groundwater samples, and it fluctuates depending on the type of ions present, temperature and concentration. The mean value of EC is 1448 µs/cm, with a range of 330 µs/cm to 2990 µs/cm in the present study area. Higher EC indicates high level of dissolved salts in groundwater samples (Rao, 2016; Prabaharan et al., 2011). TDS is a term used to describe many types of diffused minerals found in water (Hem, 1985; Narsimha and Sudarshan, 2017). In Nature, water contains significant amounts of calcium, sodium, potassium, carbonates, chlorides, bicarbonates, phosphates, magnesium, sulfate and silica as dissolved solids (Adimalla and Venkatayogi, 2018). TDS is an important parameter in quality of water for irrigation as well as drinking (Adimalla and Taloor, 2020). TDS fluctuate between 231 mg/L to 2093 mg/L, with a mean concentration of 1016 mg/L. Of those 94 samples, 3 % (n = 3) have TDS levels above the acceptable limit of 2000 mg/L, then the samples are unfit for irrigational purposes (Westcott and Ayers, 1984).
