 It has also been noted that insect attack was comparatively more in blackgram, followed by greengram and least in lentil. Phase II (March to July) During the second phase, 10 experiments were conducted for three pulses, viz. lentil, blackgram and greengram, both for whole grain as well as for splitt grain. There were three treatments, viz. control with 3 drops and with 5 drops per kg pulse. Observations were taken after 2 months and after four months. After 2 months the stored grain pests were observed in 30 samples, out of 180 samples out of which 27 samples belong to control treatment (Table 4). In other words 50% of the control treatment indicated damaged after 2 months due to insect pests. Among the 27 samples 13 belongs to whole pulse grain (lentil 4, black gram 4 and  GRAIN/SEED STORAGE Table 4.

Two samples of whole pulse (blackgram and greengram one each) where three drops of mustard oil was applied showed damage of grains. Among split pulse only one sample of greengram in which five drops of oil was applied showed damage due to insect pests. In the samples of whole pulse grain which were observed to have the presence of insect after 2 months, the damage was 10 to 18 grains/100 grain. Similarly, the weight loss in whole pulse grain ranged from 85 to 200 g, whereas the loss in splitt pulse grain was 30 to 60 g/kg. After 4 months the damage was increased to 45 samples out of 180, out of which 36 samples belonged to control treatment where oil was not applied. Only in 9 samples out of 120 samples where oil was applied showed damage by insects. The damage was more in greengram (Table 5). In greengram 200 to 360 g. weight loss per kg (25 to 35 grains/100) was observed, whereas the weight loss ranged from 150 to 260 g (15 to 20 grain per 100) in lentil and blackgram. Damages were seen only in 5 cases out of 60 in the pulses where 3 drops of mustard oil were applied per kg grain. Similarly, where 5 drops were applied the damage was observed in 3 samples out of 60.
