 Pre-treatment of plant remains Botanical remains can be charred and preserved as the result of a number of different processes such as roasting, cooking, accidental fire, Table 1 Complete details of the archaeological and modern botanical remains analysed in this study.

Only well-preserved charred remains which conformed to the experimentally determined “optimal charring win­ dow” (Charles et al., 2015; Nitsch et al., 2015) were selected for analysis. Furthermore, charred archaeobotanical remains are susceptible to different kinds of contamination (by carbonates, nitrates, and humic acid) in the soil. In order to remove contamination that can distort the stable isotope values of the cereals, it becomes necessary to carry out pre-treatment. In light of the evidence that harsh acid treatments (which have sometimes been used to remove humic acid contamination) can cause a c. 1‰ decrease in the δ15N values of the material, the pre-treatment strategy outlined by Vaiglova et al. (2014) was adopted. For pre-screening a subset of seeds from each site representing different contexts and taxa was chosen and crushed. The crushed samples were analysed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy with Attenuate Total Reflectance (FTIR-ATR): Agilent Technologies (Stockport, UK) Cary 640 FTIR instrument with a GladiATR™ accessory from PIKE Technologies (Madison, WI, USA). The results were compared with the characteristic peaks of the different contaminants (carbonates, nitrates, and humic acid) provided by Vaiglova and colleagues (Vaiglova et al., 2014, Figs.
