 In scenario analyses, we tested impacts of 3 scenarios that we believe will be relevant when interventions are implemented at scale: reducing startup costs by 50%, reducing costs of monitoring by 25% and 50%, and replacing international staff costs with local staff costs. A detailed description of sensitivity and scenario analyses are presented in the Supplemental Material - Sensitivity and scenario analyses. Finally, we estimated the potential cost of delivering the AGRI- NUT + PLA intervention to all rural populations in Odisha state, by dividing the total intervention cost by the total population in the intervention clusters (based on census data) and multiplying by the total rural population of Odisha. Results Trial coverage and participation UPAVAN’s coverage and participation are described in Table 1. Throughout the 32-mo implementation period, the UPAVAN interventions covered a mean of 4567 primary intervention participants, and 9367 women of any age, per intervention arm. So, approximately one-half of participants were pregnant women and mothers of children aged 0–23 mo, and 17% of the total population directly participated in UPAVAN intervention activities, per arm. Assuming an average of 5 members per household (and 1 participant per household, and that household members discussed the interventions), the interventions reached a mean of 87% of the total population per arm. Program costs and program cost efficiency Program costs are described in Table 2 and presented by year in Supplemental Material Table S4. Total program costs of the AGRI, AGRI-NUT, and AGRI-NUT + PLA intervention arms were estimated as US$272,121, US$366,686, and US$386,907, respectively, and the mean annual costs of the intervention arms were estimated as US$79,645, US$107,323, and US$113,241, respectively. Start-up costs accounted for ∼26% of total costs, with the AGRI-NUT arm having the highest proportion of startup costs (30%) and the AGRI-NUT + PLA arm having the lowest (23%). The main reason for higher startup costs for the AGRI-NUT arm is that more staff time was spent preparing 2260 Haghparast-Bidgoli et al.
