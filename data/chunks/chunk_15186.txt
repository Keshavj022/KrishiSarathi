 According to the framework outlined by Wallace et al. (2013), these horsegram grains fall comfortably within ‘well-watered’ status for pulses. Horsegram, as a pulse, is a nitrogen-fixer and the data conform to the values expected for zero to minimal manuring. The similarity in the Δ13C values of the plant re­ mains from this site point towards the high water availability during A. Nayak et al.

Sanganakallu-Kupgal The δ13C values of the horsegram from this site ranged from −24.8 to −22.9‰, the Δ13C values from 16.9 to 18.9‰, and the δ15N values from 1.2 to 6.6‰. The average Δ13C value was 17.9‰ (standard deviation = 0.8‰), and the average δ15N value was 3.7‰ (standard deviation = 2.0‰). The δ13C values of the barley from this site ranged from −23.2 to −20.9‰, the Δ13C values from 14.8 to 17.2‰, and the δ15N values from 7.9 to 12.6‰. The average Δ13C value was 15.9‰ (standard deviation = 1‰), and the average δ15N value was 10.5‰ (standard deviation = 1.9‰). The δ13C values of the wheat from this site ranged from −23.4 to −22.7‰, the Δ13C values from 16.3 to 17.4‰, and the δ15N values from 9.7 to 13.7‰. The average Δ13C value was 16.9‰ (standard deviation = 0.4‰), and the average δ15N value was 11.0‰ (standard deviation = 1.5‰). According to the framework outlined by Wallace and colleagues (Wallace et al., 2013), the horsegram from the site falls within the well-watered range, the wheat within the moderate-to well-watered range, while the barley falls within the poorly watered range. Addi­ tionally, the high δ15N values for all three crops likely reflect the effects of aridity, as well as of manuring. 5.6. Paithan The δ13C values of the wheat from this site ranged from −22.8 to −22.3‰, the Δ13C values from 16.3 to 16.8‰, and the δ15N values from 11.6 to 14.9‰. The average Δ13C value was 16.5‰ (standard deviation = 0.4‰), and the average δ15N value was 13.2‰ (standard deviation = 2.3‰). The δ13C values of the barley from this site ranged from −22.7 to −21.2‰, the Δ13C values from 15.2 to 16.8‰, and the δ15N values from 12.6 to 16.5‰. The average Δ13C value was 15.9‰ (standard deviation = 0.7‰), and the average δ15N value was 13.9‰ (standard deviation = 1.8‰). The δ13C values of the rice from this site ranged from −25.6 to −24.5‰, the Δ13C values from 18.6 to 19.8‰, and the δ15N values from 5.4 to 7.9‰. The average Δ13C value was 19.1‰ (standard deviation = 0.5‰), and the average δ15N value was 6.6‰ (standard deviation = 0.9‰). Wallace and colleagues’ (Wallace et al., 2013) framework suggests that the wheat from Paithan is moderately watered, while the barley is poorly watered. The Δ13C values of the rice are similar to those of modern well-irrigated rice and this is likely an indication of it being well-watered. The stable nitrogen isotope values of all crops from this site are very high, and suggest intensive manuring. 6. Discussion 6.1.
