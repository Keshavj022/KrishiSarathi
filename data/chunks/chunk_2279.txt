 With support from SDC, IWMI has organized farmers in ten SKY feeders into feeder-level solar cooperatives and another six such cooperatives are currently awaiting formal registration. IWMI-SDC Regional Project on “Solar Irrigation for Agricultural Resilience in South Asia” (SoLAR-SA) was approved and initiated in December 2019, and groundwater sustainability study is an important component of this project. Community Irrigation Management Our impact assessment study of the “West Bengal Accelerated Development of Minor Irrigation (WBADMI) Project” based on instruments of household sample survey, FGDs, KII, field visits and application of RS and GIS tools has demonstrated increase in cropping intensity, cropped area especially in Rabi season, increased irrigated area, and crop diversification in Bankura, Birbhum, Purulia and Paschim Medinipur. The results suggest the advantage of community based irrigation management and value addition through integrating this with agricultural support services. This demonstrates that creating functional WUAs and value addition through providing agricultural support services is critical for increased agricultural production and livelihood generation. Workshops, Consultations and Outreach   About 10 Workshops, consultation meetings, seminar and capacity building events were organized in partnership with ICAR. ICAR-CGIAR | ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 68   IWMI –ICAR organised a joint session on ‘How Research is Contributing to Water, Food and Nutrition Security’ at the 3rd World Irrigation forum in Bali on 3rd September, 2019   IWMI together with ICAR – Indian Institute of Water Management (IIWM), Bhubaneswar organized a workshop on Economic Water Productivity and Irrigation Benchmarking using OIBS/SAMS tool in Maharashtra on June 7th, 2019   ICAR-IIWM– IWMI co-organized together with SAARC a short course on water management at Bhubaneswar.   IWMI provided DKMA- ICAR with a IBFI Photo story to be shared online for the website   Two success stories have been shared with DKMA for being uploaded on the ICAR website– IBFI and UTFI 69 World Agroforestry (ICRAF) is closely working with ICAR institutes under NRM Division in the domain of Agroforestry and allied aspects to compliment the overall aims and goals of ICAR; and to enhance livelihoods of farmers. As part of the ICAR-ICRAF Work Plan 2016-2020 and based on the priority areas decided during the last ICAR- CG Meeting for 2019-20, the salient achievements for the year 2019 are summarized below. MIR Spectroscopy based assessment of soil health for rapid assessment of important soil parameters that can be used in the soil health card scheme Ongoing MIR Spectroscopy based assessment of soil health continued to improve the models used in MIR spectroscopy to predict soil properties in Alfisols, and to establish suitable prediction models for estimation of additional soil properties in both Alfisols and Inceptisols.
