 Acknowledging the socio-economic importance, especially in backwater tourism, the Kerala government designated pearlspot as the ‘State Fish of Kerala’. The inherent quality of pearlspot is intricately linked to Kerala’s backwaters, imparting an authentic flavour. Locally sourced pearlspot is preferred over imports from neighbouring states, where the fish is reared in freshwater and often considered inferior. Nevertheless, the current annual production of 2,000 MT falls drastically short of meeting the escalating demand of 10,000 MT per annum for 'Kerala Karimeen’. This substantial gap between supply and demand has prompted farmers to explore pearlspot culture. However, a critical constraint in this endeavour is the low availability of seeds. The annual seed requirement stands at 40 million, and the existing availability of only 8 million in Kerala highlights the pressing need to enhance pearlspot seed production. Indian Farming Low fecundity The primary challenge arises from the low fecundity of the species. The intricacies of pearlspot reproduction, characterized by monogamous behaviour and parental care, pose formidable obstacles to achieving large- scale seed production. The meticulous egg-laying and guarding behaviours, combined with the species’ low fecundity, present significant challenges for traditional hatchery methods, rendering them economically unviable. One of the primary challenges in pearlspot seed production lies in its low fecundity when compared to species like Carp fish. The prolonged nursery-rearing period and the distinctive parental care behaviour exhibited by pearlspot further compound the difficulties in large-scale seed production. These factors set it apart from other fish species, presenting unique hurdles that demand innovative solutions for sustainable aquaculture. Addressing these challenges is crucial for meeting the increasing demand for pearlspot and enhancing its commercial viability in the market. In addressing these challenges, ICAR-KVK, Ermakulam has undertaken an initiative to significantly enhance seed production by utilizing pond systems instead of the commonly followed hatchery method. This innovative approach presents a promising solution to bridge the existing demand-supply gap.

However, the yield in pond systems tends to be substantially lower due to challenges such as water quality issues and attacks by predators. Natural pond conditions significantly influence successful egg production, emphasizing the importance of well-prepared ponds. Pond preparation involves several steps, including de-watering, removal of excess humus, and eradication of weed fish using tea seed cake (at the rate of 5 g per m2 pond area). Subsequently, the pond bottom needs to be sun-dried.
