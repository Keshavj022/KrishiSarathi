 Therefore, our analyses provide a better understanding of the spatio-temporal variations of CO2 over India during agricultural seasons in relation to biomass burning, vegetation and anthropogenic activities. Furthermore, it suggests a policy implication for enforcing sustainable measures to reduce CO2 emissions from agricultural activities in India. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Introduction Atmospheric CO2 is an important component of the global carbon cycle and also a major GHG. The global average concentration of atmospheric CO2 has risen from 280 to 415 ppm (about 48%) post industrialization (Krishnapriya et al., 2020; Buchwitz et al., 2018). India contributes nearly 7% (as per an analysis performed 2018) to global GHG emissions (Olivier and Peters, 2019). The increase in atmospheric CO2 can be attributed to anthropogenic activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels, forest degradation, edaphic factors and agriculture management practices.

Environmental Technology & Innovation 27 (2022) 102498 are continuously trying and testing different alternatives to cut the carbon emissions of edaphic as well as anthropogenic origin. Significant spatial and temporal variability in atmospheric CO2 levels have been observed due to changes in the release and exchange of carbon in ecosystems. Activities altering the carbon balance also trigger global warming (Ekwurzel et al., 2017) and changes in the rainfall patterns (Kuttippurath et al., 2021), which have a snowballing impact on ecology, economy and global climate (IPCC, 2018; Kuttippurath and Raj, 2021). The balance between natural processes of carbon fixation and human activities, e.g., changes in agricultural land management practices, tillage and fertilization techniques, significantly alters the carbon balance and thus, needs immediate intervention. Consequently, processes of natural carbon balance in ecosystems have garnered public attention and studies have been done to identify primary atmospheric CO2 sources and sinks in the troposphere. Based on previous studies, sources of CO2 emissions can be broadly categorized into two types: natural and anthropogenic. Natural sources include soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition, ocean release and basal respiration of organisms. Anthropogenic sources include industrial production, deforestation, burning of fossil fuels and modern agricultural practices (Leung et al., 2014).
