 For oil palm processing, a cottage-scale unit of 1 tonne/hr has been developed by the ICAR in collaboration with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Keeping quality of the betel leaves may now be enhanced by removing the petioles from the leaves and transporting them in bamboo baskets lined with straw or banana leaves. FLORICULTURE GES ue a es Rose SADABAHAR Rose DR G.S. RANDHAWA Research on the floricultural crops is rather recent. The efforts have been at collection, maintenance, assessment and cataloguing of germplasm; development of improved varieties; standardization of agrotechniques, improvements in propagation techniques; identification and control of pests and diseases and postharvest technology. Late Dr B.P. Pal, a famous wheat breeder and the first scientist Vice-President of the ICAR, began intensive work on rose breeding in 1960 as a hobby at the IARI, New Delhi. Dr Pal evolved 105 rose varieties of the 570 bred so far. Among them are Floribundas DELHI PRINCESS, BANJARAN, CHITCHOR, MADHURA and SURYAKIRAN; and Hybrid Teas DR HOMI BHABHA, SIR C.V. RAMAN, DR M.S. RANDHAWA, Mrs KB SHARMA and UMA RAO. The other very popular roses are MRINALINI, JAWAHAR, Dr B.P. PAL, PRIYADARSHINI, MOHINI (Hybrid Teas) and HIMAGINI, PREMA, SADABAHAR, KIRAN, Dr G.S. RANDHAWA (Floribundas). Hybrid Teas RAKTAGANDHA and ARJUN are preferred for export owing to their longer stalks. In Gladiolus, through hybridization and gamma-irradiation several improved varieties have been developed at the IIHR and IARI. The mildly fragrant Gladiolus 82-11-90 is resistant to Fusarium wilt. Both, the IIHR, Bangalore, and the PAU, Ludhiana, have improved the Chrysanthemum considerably. INDIRA, RAKHEE, RED GOLD (from IIHR), and SHANTI, VASANTI and BAGGI (from PAU) are in commercial cultivation. New Bougainvillaeas have been developed through seedling selection and hybridization. They number 150. The more popular are DRH.B. SINGH, SONNET, SPRING FESTIVAL, SUMMER TIME, WAJID ALI SHAH, BEGUM SIKANDER, MARY PALMER SPECIAL and CHITRA. Interspecific hybrids of orchids Vanda IIHR 164 and Dendrobium IIHR 38 have been bred at the IIHR, Bangalore. A few good varieties have also been released in Hibiscus, jasmine, Amaryllis and tuberose, and_ in annuals â€” hollyhock, marigold, China aster, Verbena, Amaranthus, Antirrhinum and Zinnia. A FEW OF THE RESULTS IN FLORICULTURE ROSE. Rootstocks Rosa indica var. odorata up North is better; a thornless one gives 100% budding success down South. For producing quality blooms, application of 600 kg N, 200 kg each of P and K per hectare are recommendations from the BCKVV, Kalyani. In close-density planting under plastic cover during November-February, 120,000 exportable cut roses have been grown by the PAU, Ludhiana.
