 The alterations obtained due to early and enhanced germination and GA3 induced improvements in source- sink development, reduced the critical gap in obtainable and theoretical yields, causing significant increase in crop harvest index. Foliar applications of ethrel @ 100 ppm at 60 DAP and GA3 at 90, 120 and 150 DAP in first ratoon crop reduced tiller cessation induced through dense tiller population and increased stalk extension rates. This led to an increase in cane yield by 66.5 tonnes/ha against control. Along with, in-situ decomposition of sugarcane trash (dispersed in field after harvest of plant crop @12 t/ha) with Pusa compost inoculant (@ 300 g/t of trash) increased Tmax (6.73 l/ha), reduced tiller mortality (54.5 %) and sustained NMC and cane yield to 3.06 l/ha and 183.2 tonnes/ha (per cane weight of 598 g), respectively against Tmax of 4.59 l/ha, tiller mortality of 66.7 %, NMC of 1.53 l/ ha and cane yield of 99.8 tonnes/ha (per cane weight CROP MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017â€“18 57 of 501 g) in absolute control (without trash and without GA3 application). In-situ decomposition of trash along with foliar application of GA3 increased ratoon cane yield by 16.9 t/ha. The effects were also assessed at Regional Centre, ICAR-IISR, Motipur, Bihar. The induced architectural changes increased Tmax to 5.64 l/ha and NMC to 3.02 l/ha with cane yield of 258 t/ ha (per cane weight of 853 g) against Tmax of 3.02 l/ha, NMC of 1.67 l/ha and cane yield of 108 t/ha (per cane weight of 643 g) in control. Forage crops Manuring schedule for organic forage production: In hot, dry, semi-arid and monsoon climatic conditions of Bundelkhand agro- ecoregion, a minimum 0.62% soil organic carbon (SOC) is required to sustain perennial guinea + (cowpea-berseem) based organic forage production. This level of SOC can be achieved in minimum 4 years by annual application of 65 tonnes FYM/ha (50 tonnes/ha to guinea + 15 tonnes/ha to berseem). Afterwards, maintenance dose of 12.5 tonnes FYM/ha in guinea +7.5 tonnes FYM/ha in berseem is required, and with proper forage conservation measures this production level can fulfil total dry matter requirement of 9-10 ACUs. This production system can be integrated with livestock based farming system to make carbon neutral footprint of the production system since it can sequester 0.96 to 2.51 t carbon/ha/year. HORTICULTURE Plant production Fruit crops: Intervention with center opening of the canopy and cutting the cross branches, 40-year- old sapota, Cricket Ball, trees recorded higher yield (35.5 kg/tree with 375 fruits/tree having 80g fruit weight) compared with the control (18.5 kg/tree with 280 fruits/tree having 68.5 g fruit weight) at Arabhavi. Similarly at Gandevi, rejuvenation of 36-year-old sapota, Kalipatti, trees topping terminal growth of 1 m recorded higher yield of 178.27 kg/tree with 2,790 fruits/tree having fruit weight of 64.
