 High Na2O content in off-white cruse supports the salty nature of the soil used in off-white pot manu- facture. MgO is about 3.14% in off-white cruse compared to 2.82% in red cruse imported from neighboring state of Gujarat due to aesthetic appearance. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra in Fig. 11 showed the appearance of quartz (794, 690 and 460 cm1), iron oxides (583 cm1–521 cm1) and Si-O stretching (1019 cm1) off white water cruse. The pronounced character of calcite spectra (1440 cm1) in the IR curve indicates that cruse was not ﬁred above 8001C. The presence of salt in local soil helps the cruse to be baked at comparatively low temperature. From Fig. 12, a non-linear variation of compressive strength as a function of cruse height is observed. The shape of the cruse can be modeled using the information of cruse height. Further the cruse thickness would vary as an antithesis to shape of the cruse (Satankar et al., 2018). Cooling Studies The graph in Fig. 13 shows water cooling studies with the off-white cruse and red cruse during the ﬁrst week of August (with a outside dry bulb temperature of 361C). Considerable cooling is obtained while using fully ﬁlled off-white cruse as compared to red cruse.

Water equal to seventy percent by volume of immingle is added and manual mixing is performed to form the green composite which is further shaped as disks as shown in Fig. 14(d). The disks are kept overnight in a moist cloth covering. The disks are press-formed to frustum shape using a 30 ton press. Fig. 11 FTIR Spectra of off-white water cruse.

Use of Clayey Salty Soils and its Composite Derivatives for Construction and Ceramics for Household Use 943 The dimensions of the green ware thus formed were set according to a commercially available plastic bucket of 38 cm height. The green ware thus formed has to be kept for 2 days in ambient conditions and then cured under direct sunlight for 3 days. Once cured, the green ware is baked in a vertical open hearth furnace (circular shape) of a minimum 5 ft radius and 5 ft height (Roux, 2015). This updraught baking furnace was introduced in Jodhpur in 1960s (Roux, 2015). The green wares were kept 2 ft above the ground in inverted position while baking (Roux, 2015; Ravi et al., 2007). The local potters informed that pure clay ﬂower vases were baked at very high temperatures (800–9001C) using a similar arrangement. These temperatures are similar to those set in factory mode sintering of ceramic water ﬁlters (Yakub and Soboyejo, 2013; Plappally et al., 2011a,b).
