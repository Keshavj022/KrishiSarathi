 Simulation study using INFOCROP – Potato model: A simulation study in Bankura, Hooghly, Jalpaiguri, Malda and Midnapur distrcts of West Bengal using INFOCROP – Potato model to develop adaptation strategies, i.e. the agronomic practices, to minimize/ offset the negative impact of climate change on potato varieties were used; Kufri Badshah (Long duration), Kufri Jyoti (Medium duration) and Kufri Pukhraj (Early bulking) for two climatic scenarios; RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0 of IPCC AR5, for three-time series (years 2030, 2050 and 2080). Under RCP 4.5 scenario the mean tuber yield for Kufri Jyoti, across the location, is likely to be reduced Effect of 2, 4-D on control of flower drop in pomegranate Control 2,4-D@20ppm Pollen storage in date palm The date palm pollen stored under refrigerated condition and defreezed can be used up to 12 months for pollination with 65-80% fruit set as against 89 to 91% due to fresh pollen and minimum (45-55%) due to pollen stored at normal temperature. Nutrient management in mandarin through organic sources: Application of 75% vermicompost (on N equivalent basis of RDF) + Trichoderma harzianum (30-40 ml/plant) + Azadirachtin (1% at 3-4 ml/l as spray) + Pseudomonas fluorescence (30-40 ml/plant) recorded maximum fruit yield (77.62 kg and ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 79 CROP MANAGEMENT has been standardized. Application of N, P2O5 and K2O @ 50% (60:25:75 kg/ha) within 90 DAP, 25% during 90-120 DAP and the rest 25% during 120-150 DAP was optimum and economical for fertigation in taro with 25% saving of N and K nutrients and 123% higher cormel yield (16.1 t/ha) over soil application (7.2 t/ha). Nutrient management under High Density and Ultra High Density Planting in cashew: The fertilizer dosage for high density planting (4 m × 4 m) in cashew has been standardized as 195:75:115 g N: P2O5 : K2O/ tree. The recommended optimum dose for Ultra High Density Planting (2.5 m × 2.5 m) system in cashew was 70:22.5:40 g N:P2O5 :K2O/tree (112 : 36 : 64 kg/ha) with 3.2 kg/tree equivalent to 5.12 t/ha raw nut productivity. Cryopreservation and in-vitro pollen germination in cashew: In-vitro pollen germination media and methodology for Cashew were standardized. Two different media were tried such as Sucrose (5, 10 and 30%) and PEG with Boric acid, Calcium Nitrite and Magnesium sulphate. Pollen grains were collected from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM. The pollen germination was observed with PEG (Polyethylene glycol) media when the pollens were collected between 9:30 to 11:30 AM, ‘Hanging drop’ technique was followed for successful pollen germination. PEG @15% elicited significant pollen germination. Jaw-type cashew fruit and nut collector: A jaw- type cashew fruit and nut collector with container unit by 7.5, 10.4 and 13.
