 Resistant genotype against blast • The centre at IARI evaluated 10 essential oils against juveniles of M. incognita and Brassica juncea, essential oil with LC50 and LC90, 0.20 and 1.92 μg/mL, respectively, had strongest action. Molecular docking and simulation studies of the major constituent (allylisothiocyanate) of Brassica essential oil showed -cation of electrostatic interaction, -donor H bonding and Interaction with fish farmers regarding antibiotics usage • The centre at LUVAS, Hisar developed Pasteurella multocida B:2 p 52 whole cell lysate (WCL) as antigens which was characterised. • Two novel synbiotic nutraceutical products were developed by the centre at IVRI: (i) A probiotic- polyphenol based nutraceutical containing a canine-origin probiotic and two different polyphenols (probiotic-PPE-JAE) intended for gut health promotion of dogs. (ii) A probiotic- prebiotic (probiotic-JA inulin) based nutraceutical intended for gut health promotion of dogs. • Inactivated IBD vaccine standard for quantification of IBD antigen in the inactivated vaccine was developed by the Centre at IVRI. This quantification will replace the use of birds for potency testing of IBD virus vaccine and save time of 21 days. Purified truncated VP2 proteins of IBDV • The cente at SKAUST-Kashmir, evaluated the whole cell vaccine against virulent foot rot. The vaccine elicited an optimal immune response and ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 109 AGRICULTURAL HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPENT the protection lasted for 5 months. The animals are protected from day 30 and continued to be as such till day 150. • Fifteen types of scaffolds (6 types of hydrogel, 8 types of electrospun scaffolds and 1 bead type) were developed at ICAR-IVRI centre. 61 summer/winter schools of 21 days, and 50 short courses for 10 days were organized at various ICAR institutes and SAUs. The skills, knowledge and capacity building of 2,513 (1,756 M/757F) faculty were enhanced. The 39 Centres of Advanced Faculty Training imparted training to about 1,500 (1,038 M/ 462 F) scientists/ faculty members from the National Agricultural Research System through 63 training programs in cutting edge areas of agriculture and allied sciences to 3,952 faculty members/scientists. All the training programs sponsored by Agricultural Education Division were monitored through workflow based online management system. Attracting talent All-India entrance examination for admission to UG: The 25th Undergraduate Examination for admission to 15% seats (100% seats at ICAR-NDRI, Karnal, RLBCAU, Jhansi and Dr RPCAU, Pusa) of degree programmes in agriculture and allied subjects, other than veterinary sciences, including the award of National Talent Scholarship (NTS) was held on 16, 17 and 22 September 2020. The examination attracted 197,902 applications, out of which 139,360 candidates (70.42%) appeared.
