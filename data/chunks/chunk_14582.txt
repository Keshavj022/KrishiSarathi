 Here, we find that paddy-growing and mixed crop-growing households have pronounced negative impacts of rising time constraints on their nutrient intakes, while cotton-growing households do not have the same experience. Our field experiences suggest that women think in terms of recipes and not food groups, and they also tend to misjudge the time it takes to cook a recipe. One can compare time savings in food preparation be­ tween ready-to-eat food and home-cooked food. However, the existing literature stops short when it comes to food prepared at home. We fill these research gaps by methodologically contributing to the existing literature; we conceptualized and standardized 502 recipes that are locally consumed—thus, considering the local context, tastes, and preferences—in terms of the time taken to prepare and cook a recipe and the weights of each ingredient used in every recipe. We find that this method is beneficial for the collection of panel data. Table 6 Effect of opportunity cost of time on daily nutrient intakes of women by land-ownership.

All regressions use individual fixed effect models. Women who have not participated in agriculture at all across 10 months are excluded from the sample. Standard errors are clustered at the household level. Significance levels: + 0.10, * 0.05, ** 0.01, *** 0.001. 2. The control variables include daily market prices of rice, wheat, onions, potatoes, spinach, tomatoes and pigeon pea, a dummy variable for sickness of children and dummy for sickness of others in the household, and season dummies and type of day dummies.
