The limited area under crossandra crop cultivation allows the crop to fetch optimum prices in the market throughout the year. However, a lack of knowledge regarding cultivation practices, available varieties, and quality planting materials poses significant challenges to its successful production. To address these issues, scientists of Farmer FIRST Programme of ICAR-CRIDA proposed an integrative approach to crossandra cultivation, providing comprehensive farm advisories throughout the crop growth cycle. This included guidance on procuring quality seedlings, applying manures and fertilizers at the right time and dosage, and implementing a drip irrigation system as part of the project. As a result, the farmer significantly increased his net returns, achieving a remarkable profit of ` 3,00,700. The success has also served as an inspiration for other farmers in his village to adopt crossandra cultivation, promoting agricultural diversity and economic growth within the community.

Nearly 85.8% of farm holders fall in the marginal and small farmerâ€™s category possessing 34.36 lakh hectares of cultivated land.

In the adopted villages, farmers commonly cultivated a variety of field crops such as cotton, maize, redgram, and horticultural crops include marigold, chrysanthemum, and tomato, etc. In these areas, the farmers face several challenges that impact productivity and profitability. Challenges The predominant issue, in adopted villages of FFP, is low productivity of crops driven by factors such as Indian Farming 74 (11): 32-35; November 2024 frequent pest and disease attacks, and untimely rainfall, etc. These issues not only reduce yields but also increase the cost of inputs like pesticides and fertilizers, adding to the financial burden of the farmers. Compounding these challenges is market volatility, particularly for crops like marigold and chrysanthemum, which face price drops during peak seasons due to market saturation.
