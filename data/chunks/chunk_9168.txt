About 1,000 million tonnes of crop residues are annually available in India, the major residues being the straw of wheat and paddy, poorly digestible and their voluntary intake very low. The wheat straw is treated with urea (4 kg urea dissolved in 65 litres of water, sprayed or sprinkled on 100 kg of straw) and stored for 10 days. Its digestibility improves by 40-45% and the voluntary feed intake by 86-100%. Crude protein content increases from 3.5 to 7.5% and growth rate by 200-250 gaday. The growth rate otherwise is 100-120 g a day. The approximate cost of treating straw is Rs 200-250 per tonne. The treated straw contains 55-57% TDN (total digestible nutrients) and 3-4% DCP (digestible crude protein). STEAM TREATMENT OF SUGARCANE BAGASSE. Nearly 20 million tonnes of the sugarcane baggase is available in the country annually. On treatment with steam (pressure of 7 kg/cm? for 30 minutes), the voluntary feed intake and the digestibility improves by 56%, NEWER FEED RESOURCES FOR LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY By-product Annual Nutritive value Level of availability (% DM basis) feeding (tonnes) DCP TDN Kenaf cake 300 18.7 63.8 20% in CM (Hibiscus cannabinus) of calves Babul seeds 600 13.8 59.0 30% in CM (Acacia nilotica) of calves Cocoa pods 300 6.6 63.5 20% in CM (Theobroma cacao) of calves Coconut pith coir waste 2,000 0.0 62.0 20% in CM (Cocos nucifera) of calves Damaged apple waste 200 20-700 30% in CM of (Malus pumila) calves and 12.5% in broiler mash â€”_- NEWER FEED RESOURCES FOR LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY (Continued) Decaffeinated tea-waste (Camellia sinensis) Karanj-cake (solvent extract) (Pongamia pinnata) Kokam-cake (Garcinia indica) Lac-cake (Schleichera oleosa) Mango seed kernel (Mangifera indica) Mahua seed-cake (Madhuca indica) Niger seed-cake (Guizotia abyssinica) Panewar seed (Cassia tora) Rubber seed-cake (Hevea brasiliensis) Sal seed-cake (Shorea robusta) Annatto-seed (Bixa orellana) Tapioca starch waste (Manihot esculenta) Tamarind seed (decorticated) (Tamarindus indica) Tea-waste (Camellia sinensis) Mesquite pods (Prosopis chilensis) Proso millet (Panicum miliaceum) CM, Concentrate Mixture; DCP, Digestible Crude Protein; and TDN, Total Digestible Nutrients 50 1,300 150 300 10,000 3,000 100 300 150 70 300 400 87,000 150 10,000 200 7.5 25.5 93 14.73 6.1 9.3 32.7 13,9 18.6 0.1 79 1.8 11.26 a7 7.0 4.5 58.0 62.0 80.0 79,62 70.00 49.8 49.4 66.0 66.0 57.8 67.2 64.0 63.92 43.3 75.0 57.
