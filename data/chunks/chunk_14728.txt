, 2002), leading to minimum losses from leaching and it may be the reason for better K availability for crops (Singh et al., 2018). Incorporation may lead to faster decomposition of residues and thus increasing available K at par with full CA based scenarios. Higher available K in maize-wheat-mungbean system may be due to compara­ tively higher amount of residue added in maize-wheat-mungbean sys­ tem (161 t ha−1) than rice-wheat-mungbean system (138 t ha−1) which apart from adding K may also augment other soil properties conducive for better nutrient availability. Improvements in soil organic matter as observed in CA systems have been reported to significantly affect plant nutrient availability due to both changes in the quantity of nutrients available, and their distribution in the soil profile (Page et al., 2020; Sithole and Magwaza, 2019). 4.2. Potassium intensity and quantity relations as influenced by CA based managements Change in the value of the concentration ratio of K+ (CRe K) in equi­ librium solutions provides a satisfactory estimate of K+ availability in soil. These variation may be accorded to the variation in the K+ con­ centrations of equilibrating solutions, change in the period of equili­ bration, the Ca++ and/or Mg++ contents, and probably due to the differences in the mineralogical makeup of the soils (Yawson et al., 2011). The desorption point has been curtailed at the same level of 0.25 mmol K L−1 of applied K+ in all the cases showing that these soils presented almost similar adsorptive capacity. Another interesting finding in this experiment was that this value of 0.25 mmol K L−1 of applied K+ is approximately equal to 10 mg L−1 which needs to be applied for predicting Q/I parameters with a single point approach as reported by Bilias and Barbayiannis (2020). Use of this single point concentration can be done in future research to overcome the time consuming nature of Q/I approach which is one of the limitations of this method. 4.2.1. Equilibrium potassium concentration ratio (CRe 0K) The values denote immediate availability of K to plants, higher value represents higher availability. It has been found in earlier studies that soils with higher values of CRe 0K has higher contribution of exchangeable (Schindler et al., 2005) and non-exchangeable K (Jagadeesh et al., 2005). In this case also, similar reasons may be applicable. Values of ARe 0K (here, CRe 0K) > 0.01, indicate that K exchanged during equilibra­ tion are adsorbed more on planar sites; whereas ARe0K< 0.001 indicate more K comes from the more specific wedge and edge sites (van Table 3 Coefficients of correlation between Q/I parameters and NH4OAc-K+ and their interrelations.
