 heterophyllus in Eastern and North-Eastern India CROP IMPROVEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 48 indicated that (i) 124 alleles were present in all the three populations, (ii) seven alleles were unique to Eastern Plateau and Hills population, (iii) seven alleles were present only in Eastern Plateau and Hills, and Middle Gangetic Plain Region populations, and (iv) four alleles were present only in Eastern Plateau and Hills, and Eastern Himalayan Region populations. Seven alleles unique to the Eastern Plateau and Hills population were those amplified by the primers JFSSR- 4, JFSSR-18, JFSSR-20, JFSSR-101, JFSSR-134, JFSSR-135, and JFSSR-172. Out of these seven unique alleles of the Eastern Plateau and Hills population, five were specific to a small pocket near the Jharkhand- Odisha border area. The finding further suggests that the Jharkhand-Odisha border area is a priority site for the in-situ conservation of A. heterophyllus. Seed production Breeder seed production: During 2019–20, total breeder seed production in field crops was 1,15,711.9q against the indent of 85,752.8 q. The cereal crops had a major share in total breeder seed production, i.e. 68,872.8 q as against the indent of 42,152.1 q. Under pulse crops, a total of 19046.8 q breeder seed was produced against the indent of 13,476.1 q. In oilseeds, total breeder seed production was 26,862.5 q against the indent of 29,433 q. Breeder seed produced in the case of fibre crops was 179.5 q against the indent of 85.6 q and in forage crops, 750.3 q was produced against the indent of 605.8 q. foundation seed, 1,63,159.06 q of certified seeds, 97,109.52 q of truthfully labelled seed and 39,267.5 q of planting material of field crops. In addition, 169 lakh planting material and 8 lakh tissue culture plantlets were produced against the targets of 187 and 7 lakh, respectively. HORTICULTURE Crop Improvement Fruit crops Pummelo: Arka Chandra has high yield (35–40 kg/plant at 4 years) potential with 0.8–1 kg fruit weight, creamy white pulp (White group 155 A), 11–12°B TSS, 0.89% acidity, low (344.75 ng/ ml) bitter principle ‘naringenin’ and suitable for fresh consumption. Arka Anantha: It has higher yield (45–50 kg/plant Quality seed production: During the year 2019– 20, total production of quality seeds including all classes was 4,20,812.6 q against the target of 3,76,553 q. Seed production comprises of 1,21,276.54 q of at 4 years) potential with 0.9–1.2 kg fruit weight, pink pulp, 11–12°B TSS, 0.9% acidity, very low (156.64 ng/ml) bitter principle ‘naringenin’ and suitable for fresh consumption. Avocado Arka Supreme: A full grown tree yields 370–400 kg fruits, with 367– 428 g fruit weight. The fruits are oblong, have 7.8°Brix in juice and 20% fat. Pomegranate: Solapur Lal (NRCP H-6) is the first biofortified hybrid pomegranate, useful for juice or fresh consumption. This variety is of early maturity (160–165 days); higher yield (23–27 t/ha); higher TSS (17.5–17.7°B); vitamin-C (19.4–19.
