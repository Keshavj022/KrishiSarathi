The BPD units successfully nurtured and developed the skills of entrepreneurs and helped in commercialization of technologies. The salient progress of these BPDs are summarized as follows: In order to institutionalize the policy and operational guidelines, ICAR launched a scheme titled Intellectual property management and transfer/commercialization of Agricultural Technology Scheme in XI Plan. This, consequently, led to establishment of an IP governance mechanism in a three tier mode across all the institutes of ICAR. The Institute Technology Management Units (ITMUs) have been established in all ICAR institutes to pursue matters related to IP management with the purpose of accelerating transfer/commercialization of technologies in the institutes. The ten Zonal Technology Management Centers (ZTMCs) have been established to facilitate the ITMUs in their subject domain. The Intellectual Property and Technology Management (IP&TM) Unit at ICAR Hqrs does the overall facilitation; and has led by developing policy guidelines, undertaking training programs and helping the units on difficult issues beyond the capacity of ITMUs or ZTMCs. The success achieved laid the basis for providing a continuum in the ICAR for technology commercialization, incubation and entrepreneurship development. The Scheme ‘National Agriculture Innovation Fund’ (NAIF) is operating at ICAR with the following major objectives: i. Nurture the national agriculture innovation system for accelerated intellectual property (IP) generation and better protection of IP through well-established formal institutional mechanisms, that are in tune with the need of the time; and incorporate suitable instruments for incentives, awards, and other innovation- recognition mechanisms that encourage greater and rapid innovativeness in system. ii.
