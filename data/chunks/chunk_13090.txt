 On the other hand, relatively less credit will be given while awarding marks for : (a) appointment on deputation outside ICAR system where the func- tions performed by the scientists reflected by publications in recognised scientific/professional journals as are not related to job requirement at ICAR Institutes; (b) higher studies such as completion of Ph. D degree in areas unre- lated to the job requirement of the scientist at the Institute. 2. While giving credit for publications due weightage will be given to the achievements of the scientist. Publications of the scientists should specifically mention those which have been submitted for publication as also those which have been published. Only such of the publications as relate to th^. period of assessment!'re-assessment should be included. 3. Since direct recruitment to grade S-l of ARS is made on the basis of a competitive examination, such scientists take some time for training and adaptation to the system with the result that their rvsearch output may not match with that of the scientists appointed by induction/promotion. (This will gradually get reduced as there will be no induction from existing employees in due course). Suitable credit may be given to direct recruits while awarding marks on the basis of evaluation of their work. 80 ICAR AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE 4. The evaluation of the performance of the scientist will be carried out by the Members of the Assessment Committee in a proforma to be devised by the ASRB with the weightages as given above. The marks awarded by all the Members of the Assessment Committee including its Chairman will be pooled and their average will be the score of the assessee scientist. The grant of assessment benefit to the assessee scientist will be regulated on the basis of the following score : Scientist grade 'S' (Rs.550-900) (i) Promotion (ii) Three advance increments (Hi) Two advance increments (iv) One advance increment (v) Neither promotion nor advance increments. Scientist grade S-J (Rs. 700-1300) (i) Promotion (ii) Three advance increments (ii) Two advance increments (iv) One advance increment (v ) Neither promotion nor advance increments. Scientist grade S-2 (Rs. 1100-1600) (i) Promotion (ii) Three advance increments (iii) Two advance increments (iv) One advance increment (v) Neither promotion nor advance increments. Scientist S-3 (Rs. 1500-2000) (i) Promotion (ii) Three advance increments (iii) Two advance increments (iv) One advance increment (v ) Neither promotion nor advance increments.
