 The results are published in the international Journal Genome Announcements [Draft Genome Sequence of Two Monosporidial Lines of the Karnal Bunt Fungus Tilletia indica Mitra (PSWKBGH- 1 and PSWKBGH-2)]. These genomes have been deposited at GenBank under the accession MAPW00000000 (PSWKBGH-1) and MAPX00000000 (PSWKBGH-2). Validation of 50K SNP chip in rice-based on single copy genes:A unique genic-SNP genotyping chip for genetic and evolutionary studies as well as molecular breeding applications in rice has been designed and validated. The chip designed for Affymetrix platform incorporated 50,051 SNPs from 18,980 different genes spanning 12 rice chromosomes, including 3,710 single- copy (SC) genes conserved between wheat and rice, 14,959 SC genes unique to rice, 194 agronomically Circular genome map of Pseudomonas koreensis P2 (Genome size: ~6.07Mb) developed by CGview program Synteny analysis of Pseudomonas koreensis P2 strain with closest homolog Pseudomonas moraviensis by SyMap (Synteny Mapping and Analysis Program) Annotation and functional characterization of draft genome of Pseudomonas koreensis P2 PCR amplification of (A) Pgx1 (~781bp), (B) Pgx3 (~500bp), (C) Pgx2 (~620 bp), (D) ADH (~1100 bp), (E) IGS (~633 bp) and (F) Pgx5 (~1100 bp) genes in Fusarium isolates and fungal outgroup representing district geographical lineages. Lanes 1–24 are different Fusarium isolates and outgroup fungal isolates. M is a 100-bp DNA marker CROP IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 50 clearly discriminated. This genotyping system in castor is highly robust, rapid and cost-effective (~`10/data point). Marker-assisted selection in soybean: Genes for yellow mosaic virus resistance from Glycine max PI 171443 and Glycine soja have been mapped and pyramided in a single line, JS 335, using marker-assisted selection. Pulses Introgression of insect-resistance in chickpea and pigeonpea: Ten insect resistant (IR) transgenic events, five each in chickpea and pigeonpea, were identified for event selection trial. Three F1s were developed by crossing transgenic chickpea line BS 6 L (cry2Aa) with desi chickpea genotypes ( JG 11 and DCP 92-3) for insect resistance breeding programme. DNA fingerprinting A rice mini-core germplasm set (194 acc.) was designated using data from 50K Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) markers chip. Crop-specific GMO matrices of 199 GM events (with 143 GM maize events with 75 genetic elements) and 56 cotton events (with 44 genetic elements) were developed. Imported transgenic lines (207) of different species were tested for absence of embryogenesis deactivator gene- employing primers specific for cre recombinase gene. Transgenic pigeonpea lines developed The lines were developed with two Bt ICP genes, cry1AcF and cry2Aa, following a non-tissue culture- based in planta transformation for pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera) resistance. The putative transformants were selected based on kanamycin resistance and presence of T-DNA by PCR analysis.
