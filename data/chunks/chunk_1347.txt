 The team of scientists has linked farmers with the State Department of Horticulture for the construction of mushroom houses and the procurement of mushroom compost and spawn bags at subsidized rates, with technical support from university experts. An exclusive five-day certificate course on mushroom cultivation was conducted for interested farmers in collaboration with the State Department of Horticulture. Farmers in the area have now established their own mushroom units and are independently purchasing compost and spawn, in addition to participating in demonstrations conducted under the project. Farm women involved in mushroom cultivation are also preparing various value- added products during periods of market surplus and are earning substantial returns. *Corresponding author email: drc_dee@rediffmail.com Table 1.

R. Bhardwaj, Neeraj Singh*, Shubhadeep Roy, S. K. Singh and Yashpal Singh ICAR-Indian Institute of Vegetable Research, Jakkhini, Kelabela, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh 221 305 ICAR-Indian Institute of Vegetable Research, Varanasi has developed 24 improved climate-smart varieties/hybrids that are spread across the country with high yields and resistance/tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, along with numerous production and protection technologies. Additionally, protocols for processed products like bottle gourd kheer mix, bitter gourd chips, petha, and parwal sweet have been developed. The adoption of these cucurbit-based technologies is greatly benefiting small and marginal farmers in securing economic prosperity. River-bed cultivation of cucurbitaceous vegetable crops, using natural methods with minimal input, has proven highly profitable for resource-poor farming communities. Keywords: Climate-smart cultivars, Crop diversification, Cucurbits, Disease resistance, Post-harvest management I NDIAâ€™S diverse climate ensures year-round availability of various cucurbits such as pumpkin, cucumber, muskmelon, watermelon, long melon, squash, and others. Cucurbits are rich sources of vitamins (A, B, C), minerals (potassium, magnesium, manganese), carotenoids, antioxidants, polyphenols, and dietary fibre and are known for their low-calorie content. Intensive research and development by public and private sectors have boosted cucurbit production, though a significant gap remains between current and potential productivity.
