Poultry health management and their impact Indian poultry is facing a major challenge in the control of diseases. Despite strict bio- security protocols, enhanced housing facilities, and caring nutrition, India is witnessing repeated occurrences of emerging and re-emerging diseases, especially in the organized sector. Now the most alarming concern is that the post-mortem based diagnosis and treatment is often confusing since mixed infections are becoming dominant and pose difficulty for differential diagnosis. Even vaccine strains are sometimes causing the disease in birds after vaccination. The north-eastern part of India shares a porous border with China, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Myanmar adding high burden of infectious diseases to Indian poultry flocks. Pathogenic and emerging diseases namely avian influenza often causes heavy loss both in the domestic market and international trade. Respiratory disease complex and complicated chronic respiratory disease in poultry are other major challenging issues posed to the Indian poultry industry. 8.1. Avian influenza Except for avian influenza, all poultry disease outbreaks are going almost unnoticed, hence remain underreported. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5 subtype of Type A influenza virus has emerged as an economically most important disease with a significant impact on marginal and rural backyard poultry farmers (DAHD 2015). The outbreaks have occurred as epidemic waves during 2008-09 and thereafter established as sporadic occurrences.
