 Fried products such as potato-sago papads, dehydrated chips, potato sticks and potato waris can be produced by the cottage industry, which, apart from providing employment can bring remunerative returns to the rural folks. Dehydrated chips and potato sticks contain low fat and are most suited for the calories conscious people. TROPICAL TUBER CROPS Germplasm collection of 3,968 accessions comprising cassava (1,635), sweet potato (884), yams (734), aroids (551)and minor tuber crops (164) were maintained at CTCRI, Thiruvananthapuram. A total of 1,464 accessions of tuber crops, viz. cassava (1,026), sweet potato (110), Dioscorea alata (75), D. rotundata (123), D. esculenta (28), Dioscorea sp. (28), Colocasia esculenta (71) and Chinese potato (3) were transferred to in vitro medium term conservation. Two cassava hybrids, Sree Rekha (48.0 tonnes/ha) and Sree Prabha (42.0 tonnes/ ha) with good cooking quality under upland and lowland conditions were released for cultivation in Kerala. True Cassava Seed Technology was developed in order to overcome the biological constraints of cassava like low multiplication rate and bulk of seed material requirement, and to enhance rapid spread of the crop to non- traditional and far-flung poverty-stricken areas. Two sweet potato lines RS III-3 and CIP 4 90056.2 with a yield potential of 25-28 tonnes/ha were promising in on farm trials and are in pre-release stage. Five high-yielding accessions of greater yam (Dioscorea alata), 3 of elephant-foot yam (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius) and 2 of taro were identified for further evaluation. Three cassava genotypes, CE 165, CE 328 and CI 301, were drought tolerant with more than 25% extractable starch content and maintained optimum leaf area index (LAI), green canopy and high light interception under drought conditions. In greater yam, non-pruned, non-trailed crop produced comparable yield as trailed crop, pruned at 2m height. Significantly higher tuber yield could be obtained from non-trailed, widely spaced crop as compared to trailed, closely spaced crop. Maximum tuber yield (9.28 tonnes/ha) could be obtained, by planting Chinese potato on flat beds at a spacing of 45 cm Ã— 30 cm in vertical position. On farm technology validation on sex pheromone impregnated 4 mm ID rubber tubing, conducted at Thiruvananthapuram, Hyderabad, Dapoli, Dholi, Ranchi, Kalyani and Faizabad showed that the septa were effective in the mass trapping of weevils. Survey on white fly (Bemisia tabaci) and its natural enemies led to the identification of 2 new parasitoids, viz. Encarsia sp. and E. strenua, 3 new predators, THREE-ROW SUB-SOILER DESIGNED The 3-row sub-soiler designed and developed with an effective field capacity of 0.55 ha/hr and it required 55-60 HP for 300-500mm deep penetration. A potato digger for potato-sugarcane intercrop was also designed.
