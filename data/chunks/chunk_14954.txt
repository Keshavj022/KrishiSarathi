Baraj et al. Heliyon 10 (2024) e29586 8 Among these 359 articles, the highest number of publications (56 articles) were conducted in Zone 10, the Southern Plateau and Hills region, which includes parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana states. As depicted in Fig. 6, this region emerged as the primary geographical area of focus. It was followed by Zone 6, encompassing the Trans-Gangetic plains covering New Delhi, Punjab, and Haryana states, with 48 articles. Zone 4, the Middle-Gangetic Plains, covering most parts of Uttar Pradesh, had 46 articles, and Zone 2, the Eastern Himalayan region, had 40 articles. In contrast, the number of CCRASAI publications is relatively low in Zone 15 (the Islands region), Zone 13 (the Gujarat plains and hills), and Zone 14 (the Western Dry region), with only 23 articles combined. The reason for more research in the Trans-Gangetic and Middle-Gangetic plains might be due to the increased attention these regions have received as a result of higher crop production after the Green Revolution. It could also be attributable to the presence of numerous research institutes and government offices in these regions, particularly in New Delhi and its surrounding areas. Similarly, the higher number of research studies in the Southern Plateau and Hills region, which covers parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana, might be due to an increased focus on dry land agriculture and drought, and the presence of agricultural academic and research institutes in these areas. The regions where there has been less research on CCRASAI are also vulnerable to CC, suggesting a need for more research in these agro-climatic regions and states in India. 3.7. Knowledge structure of climate resilience research: Co-word analysis The keyword network is represented in Fig. 7, where the size and color of each circle indicate the frequency and type of the cluster, respectively. Details of each cluster are discussed below. The proximity of the circles indicates the frequency of co-occurrence, while the thickness of the connecting lines (links) represents the strength of co-occurrence between the two circles. VOSViewer software was utilized to assign different colors to the clusters based on their weight or significance. The colors range from yellow (very low score) through blue (low score), green (average score), to red (high score) [27]. 3.8. Sustainable agriculture (cluster 1) The sustainable agriculture cluster is a critical research area that aims to develop agricultural practices that are environmentally sustainable, socially responsible, and economically viable.
