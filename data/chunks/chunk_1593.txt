 Technology-driven services and agri-tech innovations Digital platforms like Kisan Network and DeHaat help farmers sell directly to buyers, improving profit margins by eliminating intermediaries. E-NAM (National Agriculture Market) enhances transparency and provides better market access, helping farmers secure fair prices. The RKVY-Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) supports the adoption of these technologies, offering financial assistance for advanced tools. Entrepreneurs can seek support from Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) and NABARDâ€™s Rural Innovation Fund, making agri-tech solutions more accessible. Agriculture machinery services Custom hiring centers offer an affordable way for smallholder farmers to access costly machinery like combine harvesters, threshers, rotatvators and laser land leveler. The Custom Hiring Center (CHC) Scheme under RKVY-SMAM provides subsidies for machinery rentals and eventually can lead to enhancing crop productivity. Contract-based services for pest management like plant protection in commercial crops such as cumin, cotton and pomegranate allow farmers to benefit from low-cost and low pesticide residue in the produce while reducing labour burdens. NABARD offers loans for establishing such services, supporting efficiency and specialization in agriculture. Agri-business and entrepreneurship support ICAR Institutes like CAZRI, Jodhpur through Agri- Business Incubation initiative provide mentorship and technical assistance to agri-entrepreneurs by turning innovative ideas into viable businesses. Moreover, Agri-business Incubators under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY-RAFTAAR) offer funding and guidance, reducing start-up risks. Besides knowledge, access to funding is vital for scaling ventures, and schemes like Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) support infrastructure development for agro-processing units. Mudra Loans provide financial support to small-scale entrepreneurs and are promoting rural development. Agri-tourism and cultural heritage Arid regions like Rajasthan offer rich cultural heritage that can attract tourists, providing a new source of income for farmers. Farm stays, camel rides, and traditional meals give visitors an authentic rural experience. The Swadesh Darshan Scheme supports infrastructure development for agri-tourism, helping farmers create visitor-friendly setups. During events like the Pushkar fair, Maru Mahotsav etc. engaging tourists with hands-on farming activities boosts local tourism. Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC) provides promotional support, increasing the visibility and attractiveness of such initiatives. Impact of entrepreneur diversification in arid regions Each diversification initiative is to be evaluated based on its potential to contribute to local community well-being.
