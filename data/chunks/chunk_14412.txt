 Similarly, AGRI and AGRI-NUT were less cost-effective than Mama SASHA at improving maternal diet diversity, but AGRI-NUT + PLA was more cost-effective (cost per food group increase for: AGRI US$517; AGRI-NUT US$603; Mama SASHA US$324; AGRI-NUT + PLA US$325) (47). For NEEP-IE, effects on maternal diet diversity were not reported. Taken together, our findings show broadly similar cost profiles, cost-efficiency, and cost-effectiveness for UPAVAN, NEEP-IE, and Mama SASHA. Although the UPAVAN trial was not designed to detect differences between intervention arms, we note that the higher cost-effectiveness in the AGRI-NUT + PLA Economic evaluation of UPAVAN trial 2263 TABLE 5 UPAVAN intervention consequences, measured as effects on trial outcomes among trial participants included in the endline survey1 Control AGRI vs. control AGRI-NUT vs. control AGRI-NUT + PLA vs. control n n aRR (95% CI) n aRR (95% CI) n aRR (95% CI) Child minimum diet diversity (ate ≥4 food groups) 757 822 1.06 (0.91, 1.23), 812 1.19 (1.03, 1.37)2 863 1.27 (1.11, 1.46)2 Maternal minimum diet diversity (ate ≥5 food groups) 997 1100 1.21 (1.01, 1.45)2 1055 1.16 (0.98, 1.38) 1139 1.30 (1.10, 1.53)2 Child minimum acceptable diet 790 862 1.01 (0.86, 1.19) 829 1.19 (1.02, 1.41)2 895 1.30 (1.12, 1.52) Women made ≥2 decisions in agriculture or health 997 1100 1.05 (1.00, 1.11)2 1055 1.05 (0.99, 1.1) 1139 1.02 (0.96, 1.07) Total value of agricultural production over 1 y, US$ 996 1100 108 (31, 231)1 1053 −5 (−134, 118) 1138 70 (−2, 190) Net value (total value minus input costs) of agriculture production over 1 y, US$ 996 1100 97 (25, 219)2 1053 −3 (−131, 112) 1138 76 (12, 196) 1AGRI, nutrition-sensitive agriculture intervention; AGRI-NUT, nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific agriculture intervention; AGRI-NUT + PLA, nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific agriculture intervention using participatory learning and action approach; aRR, adjusted RR, only reported for the statistically significant outcomes of the trial; PLA, participatory learning and action; UPAVAN, Upscaling Participatory Action and Videos for Agriculture and Nutrition; vs., versus. 2Significantly different from the control arm, P < 0.05. intervention compared with that in the control arm suggests that the AGRI-NUT + PLA intervention is a better value for the money than the AGRI or AGRI-NUT interventions. Therefore, the Participatory Learning and Action component may help to increase cost-effectiveness of NSA interventions. The choice of which intervention to scale up will depend on transferability of intervention models across contexts, and policymaker priorities for other outcomes.
