Grain hardness score of DBW 316 is 77.2, whereas, hectolitre weight is 74.0. Economics and health benefits: Farmers can save roughly `2400 per hectare by forgoing the use of fungicides for disease control because the new wheat variety is resistant to all major diseases that might lower wheat grain yield. While DBW 316 has the highest grain protein (13.2%), this variety can fetch higher price for having Table 2. DBW 316 (Karan Prema) package of practices along with attainable yield levels Suitability of the variety for the area North Eastern Plains Zone (NEPZ) of India under irrigated late sown conditions Selection of field and/land preparation Flat fertile soil, pre-sowing irrigation followed by ploughing with disc harrow, tiller and leveller at field capacity for optimum field conditions. Seed treatment Systemic and contact fungicide (carboxin 37.5% + thiram 37.5%) @2–3 g/kg seed. Sowing time 5–15 December. Seed rate/sowing method 125 Kg/ha. Sowing with seed drill keeping with spacing of 18 cm between the rows. Fertilizer doses Under restricted irrigation best performance can be achieved by applying 120: 60: 40 kg NPK/ha. Half dose of nitrogen at sowing and remaining ½ at first node stage should be applied. Weed control For the control of broad-leaf weeds 2,4-D @500 g/ha or metsulfron @4 g/ha or carfentranzone @20 g/ha can be sprayed using about 300 litres of water/ha. In multiple herbicide resistant P. minor infested areas, use pre-emergence pendimethalin 1500 g/ha or pyroxasulfone 127.5 g/ha. For the control of complex weed flora combination of isopruturon with 2,4-D/metsulfuron or sulfosulfuron with metsulfuron or grass herbicide followed by broad-leaf herbicide should be applied at 30–40 DAS at sufficient soil moisture. Pest and disease control DBW 316 is resistant to stripe, leaf and stem rust and other diseases. However, for the control of rusts, powdery mildew, apply propiconazole/triademefone/tebucanazole @0.1% (1 ml/litre) as foliar spray after initial appearance of disease should be done. Irrigation 3–5 irrigations depending upon moisture status and weather conditions. Harvesting Harvest and thresh as soon as crop is fully ripe. The grain should be thoroughly dried before storage. Mean yield 41 q/ha under late sown irrigated conditions of Eastern Plains. Potential yield 68 q/ha. inherent biofortified value. The increased nutritional value for high protein and zinc content translates into huge health benefits at no extra cost to the poor strata of society.
