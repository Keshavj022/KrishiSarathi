 The flock mortality was quite low (6.21%) during the period. Kids at a farm based unit of Sirohi breed at the CSWRI, Avikanagar, Rajasthan, attained a body weight of 20.36 kg at 6 months of age. Their body weight gain was 83 g/day during 3-6 months of age. The part lactation yields for 90 and 150 days were 66.67 and 84.85 kg, respectively. The breeding efficiency was 82.69% on the basis of does tupped. CAMEL Age at first calving in Bikaneri, Jaisalmeri and Kachchhi was, respectively, 2,017.93±87.65, 2,088.79±70.78 and 1,971.33±200.59 days. Calving interval was 740.76±10.67 days. The gestation period of Kachchhi females was 385.17±1.53 days, Bikaneri 390.20±0.93 days and Jaisalmeri 389.52±0.98 days. Pedigree information related to herd of centre was created. An informative database on reproductive performance (1992-2000), health (1984-2000), body biometry measurements, hair and milk production of all camels maintained at the Centre was created. Breeding tract database of Jaisalmeri camel was created. PIG At the ANGRAU, Tirupati, breeding programme was drawn with boars and sows of 50% LWY group and boars and sows of 75% LWY group. At the AAU, Khanapara, halfbred and Hampshire gilts were mated. Average litter size at birth in the second crop was 7.920±0.57 in 50% H and 9.31±0.33 in 75% H group. At the KAU, Mannuthy, breeding programme was drawn with gilts and boars. Litter size averaged 6.53±0.40 at birth and 6.39±0.39 at weaning. Average litter weight was 7.38±0.71 kg at birth and 51.68±3.44 kg at weaning. In addition to the existing centers two new research centers one each at BAU, Ranchi, Jharkhand, and another at the ICAR Research Complex, Goa, were initiated. MARWARI GOAT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMME Field based centre of Marwari breed under the RAU, Bikaner, has four village centres in the home tract of Marwari goats. The average body weight at 2-4-6 teeth and full mouth were 24.44±0.48, 28.18±0.035, 29.43±0.61 and 33.31±0.19 kg, respectively. Milk productions for 30, 60 and 90 days were 55.14±1.12, 108.43±2.11 and 158.72±2.84 kg respectively. The number of goat breeders having agriculture along with the animal husbandry was highest (82.55%). Breeders having more than 25 goats earned 4% more income than those having less number of goats. An informative database on camels was created at the NRCC DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 98 RABBIT Rabbit for Meat At Avikanagar, 907 kits were produced during this period from White Giant (WG) (344), Soviet Chinchilla (SC) (533) and Black Brown (BB) (30) breeds. Breeding stock was selected with high selection differential. The selection differentials in 12 weeks were 227.26 g in WG and 203.7 g in SC breeds. Among litter traits, the selection differential for litter size at birth (LSB) was 0.54 in WG and 1.79 in SC for litter size at weaning (LSW), 1.11 in WG and 1.98 in SC. Males were selected on the basis of 12-week body weight while females were selected on the basis of litter traits.
