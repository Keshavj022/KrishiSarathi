 2016 Pusa Double Zero Mustard 31 (PDZ-1) and RLC 3: First two varieties of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) with double zero quality (<2% erucic acid and <30 PPM glucosinolates content) released. Achievements in Field Crops in Independent India 99 Year Milestone 2018 NRC127: First Kunitz Trypsin Inhibitor (KTI) free marker-assisted selection derived soybean variety developed by an introgressing null allele of KTI in cv JS 97-52, ISH- 185: CGMS based safflower hybrid released. 2019 Girnar 4 and Girnar 5: For the first time, high oleic acid (upto 78%) containing two groundnut varieties centrally released. ISF-1: First high oleic (70% oleic acid) safflower variety released. 2021 NRC 147: Release of first high oleic acid soybean variety; NRC 132: Release of first lipooxygenase 2 free soybean variety. 3.7. Sugarcane Sugarcane is cultivated on an area of about 5.0 Mha, which is about 3% of cultivated land in the country. India ranked second among sugarcane growing countries of the world by contributing 18.01% in area and 19.76% in the production of sugarcane during 2018. During 2019-20, India produced 404.74 Mt of cane, 27.39 Mt of sugar and 13.81 Mt of molasses. India became the largest sugar producer during 2018-19 (33.16 Mt) which accounts about 17.6% of the total sugar produced in the world. Improved sugarcane varieties have made a major contribution in increasing yield from 36.4 t ha-1 in 1947-48 to 80.5 t ha-1 during 2019-20 and sugar recovery from 9.91% to 10.84% in the same period (the highest being 11.01% during 2018-19). Since 1947, a total of 2,795 ‘Co-clones’ have been evolved by the ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute led to the identification of 566 Co and Co-allied varieties for different agroclimatic zones. AICRP-Sugarcane came into existence in 1982 which facilitated the multi-location evaluation of improved varieties. In independent India, 134 varieties have been developed and notified for cultivation in the country. Co 740, Co 1148, Co 6304, Co 6907, Co 7717, BO 91, CoJ 64, CoC 671, CoS 767, CoSe 92423 are worth mentioning varieties that have contributed to expanding the sugar industry and sustaining the sugarcane cultivation in the country. Among the recent varieties, Co 0238 and Co 86032 are mega varieties with 2.77 and 0.89 Mha, respectively in subtropical and tropical India (Bakhshi Ram 2021). Box 8: Co 0238: A Wonder cane The variety Co 0238 has revolutionized the sugarcane cultivation in sub-tropical India and covers about 84% area in the sub-tropical region with 53.4% of the total sugarcane area of India. As a result, 19.7 t ha-1 and 2.44 per cent improvement in average cane yield and sugar recovery, respectively of five sub-tropical states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
