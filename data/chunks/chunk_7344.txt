Palamu goat of Jharkhand: Small size goat is also known as Medini. Its distribution area is Palamu, Latehar and Garhwa of Jharkhand. Average flock size is 5.36±0.19. Average age at first mating in males is 8.32±0.86 months; and in females 7.22±1.35 months. Machrela sheep population of Andhra Pradesh: Macherla sheep is famous for meat production and distributed in Guntur, Krishna, Prakasham of Andhra Pradesh and Nalgonda district of Telangana state. More than 99% of females are polled and males are horned. Average adult body weight of males is 53.95±1.87 kg. The age at first lambing in ewes is about 18 months as reported by most of the farmers. Balangir goat of Odisha: Goats are black or brown in colour with border on ears. Average age and weight at slaughter is 17.48±1.89 months and 20.56±1.15 kg. Average age at first kidding, kidding interval and kidding rate are 11.09 months, 218.16±0.09 days and 1.94, respectively. Average herd size is 8.02 and estimated population is 2 lakh. Poonchi chicken of Kashmir: Landless or marginal farmers rear them for meat and egg. Adult body weight is 2.78±0.25 kg in males and 1.90±0.04 kg in females.

Genetic characterization of livestock populations: Five indigenous livestock populations of Kathani cattle, Balangir goat and Marwari, Sindhi and Kharai camel were characterized using a panel of 25 microsatellite markers, specific for each species. Establishment of National Bovine Genomic Centre–Indigenous breeds: A total of 1,676 animals belonging to diverse breeds were sequenced at a coverage of 10x, yielding 60 GB of data per animal. The chips created and tested on 480 each of cattle and buffalo had given 99.8% call rate. Both the chips were validated for the informativeness of their markers. Total 14,006 animals belonging to CHRS Ajmer, CHRS Rohtak, CHRS Ahmedabad and BAIF were recorded for milk traits. About 4,000 animals have completed the lactation, their DNA was isolated. Serum metabolome of animal germplasm of Ladakh region: Metabolic profile of serum samples (33) of livestock species in Ladakh (Ladakhi cattle, Jeresy cattle, Ladakhi donkey and Changathngi goat) adapted to high altitude was evaluated assessing a complementary systems-wide approach to elucidate the influence on these species. Such kind of analysis will help to delineate the metabolites that are making these species to naturally adapt and survive in harsh and hypobaric conditions. Transcriptomic analysis of Bandur (Mandya) sheep meat: Among the meat type sheep breeds in India, organoleptic characteristics of meat of Bandur sheep are highly preferred by consumers.
