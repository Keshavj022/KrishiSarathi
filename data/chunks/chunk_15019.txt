5 The transport infrastructure that I examine in this paper is a much smaller system of local roads that link villages to other nearby villages or to the local road network. Such 2 For example, Foster and Rosenzweig (1995) document that information frictions serve as a barrier in the adoption of HYV seeds, and explore the role of learning by doing and learning from others in alleviating this barrier. Munshi (2004), Bandiera and Rasul (2006) and Conley and Udry (2010) further explore the role of social learning in the diffusion of new technologies. Suri (2011) demonstrates that low rates of adoption of technologies such as hybrid maize are correlated with high costs of acquiring the technologies due to poor infrastructure, and Porteous (2019) shows using a counterfactual estimation that agricultural technology adoption only increases farmers’ income when trade costs are low. See Feder et al. (1985) for a survey of barriers to technology adoption in agriculture in low-income countries, and Foster and Rosenzweig (2010) for a more recent survey on barriers to technology adoption generalized to a range of technologies and settings. 3 Rural labor markets in developing countries are characterized by substan- tial frictions (Singh et al., 1986; Benjamin, 1992; Fafchamps, 1993; Bryan et al., 2014; LaFave and Thomas, 2016; Kaur, 2019) that are consequential for labor market functioning (Breza et al., 2021). Recent work by Jones et al. (2020) illustrates that labor and land market failures constrain farmers’ adoption of a profitable agricultural technology — hillside irrigation — in Rwanda. 4 For example, Burgess et al. (2015) find evidence of ethnic favoritism in the provision of paved roads across the post-independence period in Kenya; districts that shared the same ethnicity as the president had double the amount of expenditure on roads, and five times the length of paved roads. 5 For example, Banerjee et al. (2021) estimate the effect of highways in China on per capita GDP levels and growth; Allen and Atkin (2016) examine the effects of expanding India’s highway network on trade costs and subsequently, farmers’ revenue volatility and portfolio choice; Jedwab and Moradi (2016) estimate the effect of colonial railroads in Ghana on the spatial distribution and aggregate level of economic activity; Donaldson (2018) estimates the impact of railroads in India on agricultural trade costs, interregional price gaps, trade volumes and real income; and Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016) estimate the effect of the expansion of railroads in the US on agricultural land values.

This paper makes several contributions to the literature on small- scale, local infrastructure.
