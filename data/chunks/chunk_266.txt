 Colour: Colour is the property of a fibre, which distinguishes its appearance as redness, yellowness, greyness etc. It consists of incandescent light source, sensor, display and wooden platform to place the sample. In this instrument, incandescent source of light and Artificial intelligence has become crucial in detecting, identifying, and measuring objects, including jute fibre and fabric defects, using machine learning and deep learning techniques. This demonstrates the feasibility of using AI-powered tools for jute grading as well. Researchers should concentrate on developing integrated instruments capable of measuring all parameters for jute grading. Exploring the possibility of mobile/scanner gadgets/tools using image machine learning alongside a few mechanical setups, like bundle strength measurement, could offer a comprehensive solution. The main focus should be on providing these instruments to farmers rather than industrial players, as farmers are essential in maintaining the quality of jute. Hands-on training and demonstrations can familiarize farmers with the quality of jute fibre based on their testing experience. SUMMARY The traditional organoleptic and visual method of jute assessment has certain drawbacks, including bias and lack of scientific basis. In order to achieve a more objective assessment of jute fibre, digital grading instruments have been developed and are currently in use. The method of grading using digital instruments provides a more scientific and objective approach. Additionally, these instruments significantly reduce the time required for fibre assessment compared to mechanical instruments. By employing instrumental grading at procurement centers, farmers can obtain a fair price for their produce due to the fast and accurate readings provided by these instruments. *Corresponding author e-mail: nagesha.kumar88@gmail.com Automatic bundle strength tester Digital fineness meter Digital colour and luster meter photodiode sensor are used to accept the reflected light from the sample under test. The digital colour and luster meter has good correlation with mechanical colour meter. Way forward The digital instruments demonstrated promising performance characteristics, indicating their potential for rapid and accurate assessment of fibre quality. The current standard recommended by BIS includes both grading methods. However, the hand and eye method is preferred due to its simplicity and faster process, especially when digital instruments are scarce. To ensure unbiased grading, BIS should enforce the use of instrument-based grading exclusively. In addition, BIS should consider reducing the number of samples required for testing jute fibre, as the current preparation process is time-consuming. Researchers and instrument developers should focus on creating user-friendly, fast, accurate, and convenient instruments to measure grading parameters.
