 In all, five different mutants were generated, and from this two SDN1 type mutants free from introduced exogenous DNA were identified. As per Department of Biotechnology (DBT) SOPs for regulatory review of genome edited plants under SDN-1 and SDN-2 categories, data were generated. These two mutants identified, produced significantly higher grain yield in Summer 2023 under transgenic field condition in irrigated environment. Two mutants of DST gene free from exogenous introduced DNA are being evaluated in AICRIP 2024. 2 Salient Achievements of the Projects Glimpses of National Agricultural Science Fund (2006-2023) 10 Grain yield of DST gene edited mutants (∆366bp and ∆2bp) produce significantly higher grain yield than WT MTU1010 under irrigated (top panel) and drought stress (bottom panel) conditions. Earlier, high yielding CKX2 mutants of rice cultivar BPT5204 (Samba Mahsuri) were developed. Molecular analysis led to the identification of one homozygous and transgene free edited line, referred to as GeD7-26. Under transgenic network conditions, the GeD7-26 showed significant increase (>35%) in grain yield as compared to BPT5204 (WT). The required molecular/physiological/morphological data have been generated. The mutants of CKX2 gene free from exogenous introduced DNA were evaluated in AICRIP 2023. Thus, the DST and CKX2 mutants are the first set of genomes edited mutant lines that have been exempted from Rules 7-11 of Rules 1989 (noted in 259th RCGM on 31st May 2023) and were evaluated under AICRIP. were identified at two stem elongation stages. The RNAseq and the qRT-PCR results showed a significant correlation (r2 = 0.82; P < 0.01) between the methods. The results obtained by the RNAseq experiment were in agreement with qPCR, and hence, considered reliable. Six miRNAs with differential expression in dwarf phenotype were identified. BC3F4 seeds carrying alternative dwarfing genes Rht14 and Rht18 were obtained in the background of HD 2967, HD 3086, HI 1544 and HI 1500 by marker- assisted backcross breeding. Similarly, BC3F4 plants in the background of C-306, HI 8498 and NP 200 carrying Rht14 and Rht18 were selected for further advancement. The average genetic background recovery observed in Rht14 and Rht18 introgressed lines were 85.35% (HI 1544), 88.90% (HD 3086) and 79.24% (HD 2967). Lines with improved coleoptile length, seedling shoot length, plant height and resistance to leaf and stripe rust were identified. These results provided advanced wheat breeding lines with alternative dwarfing genes and better seedling establishment traits suitable for conservation agriculture. Fine mapping and marker-assisted breeding for alternative dwarfing genes Rht14 and Rht18 to develop semi-dwarf wheat genotype: The fine mapping was carried out to understand the molecular mechanism of alternative dwarfism in wheat. The Rht18 region was delimited to 7.5 Mbp with closest SSR marker at 0.23 cM.
