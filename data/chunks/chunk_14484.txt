 [40] Payload weight The adoptability of UAVs is primarily impeded due to the load-carrying capacity. This challenge is exceptional in the case of adopting UAVs, especially for spraying fertilisers. [41] Social Infringe of privacy Deploying UAVs over the buildings may not be acceptable to all the community residents as the UAV movement can make the community residents cautious since UAVs are known for monitoring and surveillance. [42,43] Threat to property and animals UAVs if crashed within the building promises could either harm residents, animals and can also damage the property. [44] Educational background Educational qualification indirectly influences the choice of adopting the use of UAV in agricultural activities. [45] Noise Pollution Community residents may experience noise pollution during the flight of the UAV due to propellers rotating at high speeds. [46] Behavioural Attitude to adopt It refers to the subjective probability of an individual explaining if they perform a specific task or demonstrate specific behaviour. Considering this help to analyse the intention of the farmer to adopt using UAV for various agricultural purposes. [47] Awareness Lack of subjective knowledge about UAVs impediments to understand its benefits. Considering this parameter help to [42] Perceived ease of use It signifies the degree to which an individual believes using the UAVs would involve no effort. Considering this parameter help to test the comfortable levels of farmers to adopt UAV for agricultural purposes. [48] Fear of unemployment Intervention of autonomous systems in any sector may substitute the need of manpower which consequently create the fear of unemployment as agriculture is the primary occupations in the rural areas. [49] Perceived behavioural control It demonstrates the behavioural ease of the person in adopting UAV for agricultural purposes. [50] Operational Skilled workforce Deploying a drone requires necessary skill set and the needs training to get comprehensive understanding of the drone regulation and guidelines which is lacking among the farmers. [43] Meteorological parameters The regional climatic conditions control the UAV deployment. For instance, the typical wind speed in agricultural farms will be high leading the drifting of UAVs. Also, the weather conditions impact the deployment. [51] Flying/non-flying zones Different countries have classified the regions into flying and non-flying zones based on their own country-specific rules and guidelines. If an agricultural farm is within the proximity of restricted places, it may fall within a non-flying zone making deployment of UAVs a challenge. [52] Economic challenges High maintenance cost Since the technology is in nascent stages, the involved maintenance cost is relatively high. [48] Cost of components Drone industry being at the evolution stage, the cost of components as of today are relatively high.
