 In May, 2016, two more scenarios were imposed to include water man­ agement practices into consideration (sub-surface drip irrigation). The plot size is 20 m × 100 m and the treatments are replicated thrice with Table 1 Basic physical and chemical soil properties (0–15-cm soil depth) of the experi­ mental site at CSSRI, Karnal, India at the start of the experiment (year 2009) (Gathala et al., 2013). Soil properties Value (Mean± SE) Soil texture Loam Sand (%) 34.03 ± 0.77 Silt (%) 46.07 ± 0.76 Clay (%) 19.89 ± 0.50 Particle density (g cm−3) 2.57 ± 0.01 Soil pH (1:1:: soil:water) 8.00 ± 0.02 EC (dS m−1) 0.37 ± 0.02 Total carbon (%) 0.56 ± 0.01 Total nitrogen (%) 0.06 ± 0.002 Total potassium (%) 2.28 ± 0.001 Available phosphorus (mg kg−1) 5.74 ± 0.29 Available potassium (mg kg−1) 130 ± 1.73 Mineralogy Illite (39%), mixed layers (37%), vermiculite & chlorite (6%), smectite (13%) (Kapoor et al., 1981) K. Rani et al. Soil & Tillage Research 228 (2023) 105644 3 randomized block design. The treatment differences in management practices adopted under this experimental set up are given below: Scenario 1 (Sc1). : Conventional till rice-wheat cropping system with residues removed. This scenario mimics farmer’s practice of soil and crop management based on the survey of about 40 farmers from 10 to 12 surrounding villages in the year 2009–2010 and 2010–2011 prior to the rice and wheat seasons (Gathala et al., 2013). Rice–wheat–fallow was adopted as this is the dominant cereal cropping system in this region. Both rice (Oryza sativa L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were sown with conventional tillage, manual transplanting of 30-days-old rice seedlings in puddled soil and wheat by manual broadcasting. Scenario 2 (Sc2). : Partial CA based rice-wheat-mungbean system. In this system, rice was transplanted in puddled soil and subsequently wheat and mungbean (Vigna radiata L.) both were sown by seed drilling in zero-till (ZT) conditions, residues were not retained instead they were incorporated during rice. Scenario 3 (Sc3). : Full CA based rice-wheat-mungbean system. Crop residues were retained on soil surface and crops (rice, wheat and mungbean) were sown under ZT condition. Scenario 4 (Sc4). : Full CA based maize-wheat-mungbean system. All the three crops i.e. maize (Zea mays L.), wheat and mungbean were drill seeded under ZT with residue retention. Scenario 5 (Sc5). : Same as Sc3 with sub surface drip (SDI) installed 20 cm below the soil surface. Scenario 6 (Sc6). : Same as Sc4 with SDI installed 20 cm below the soil surface. All the crops were sown with happy seeders at a depth of 5 cm except in case of CT (Sc1) practice where rice was transplanted and irrigated (5–7 cm depth of standing water).
