 Devices or Things: These are the physical objects equipped with sensors and actuators that gather and transmit the data. Sensors are essential components that collect environmental data, such as temperature, humidity, motion, light, etc. Connectivity: This includes the network technologies that facilitate communication between devices, ensuring secure and efficient data transfer. Generally, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks are used to transmit data. Data processing: Data collected from devices must be processed to derive meaningful insights, which can be done on the device or in the cloud. User interface: The user interface could be any mobile application, web dashboard, or control system allowing data monitoring, device control, and configuration settings. It allows end users to interact with IoT devices. Cloud computing and analytics: The cloud provides storage and computing power for a large amount of data, and analytics tools help interpret that data. Security: Security measures like data encryption, authentication, secure communication protocol and regular updates are essential to protect IoT systems. Types of sensors In horticulture, various types of sensors are used to monitor and manage the environmental conditions that affect plant growth. These sensors help by providing real- time data on various parameters that can enhance crop management and ultimately increase efficiency. Technical challenges The implementation of IoT in horticulture presents several technical challenges that need to be addressed. A major challenge is the lack of communication infrastructure in rural areas, where many regions remain unconnected to the Internet. Additionally, the cost of components, such as sensors, automated machinery, farm management software, and cloud services, can be expensive, making them difficult to afford. Maintaining IoT devices also incurs extra costs, and regular maintenance and repairs require technical expertise that is not always readily available, especially in rural areas. Moreover, existing agricultural systems, such as irrigation and climate control, may not be compatible with new IoT technologies, creating operational bottlenecks. Devices manufactured by different companies often use various communication protocols, leading to interoperability issues. Data management is another significant challenge, as IoT sensors generate vast amounts of data.
