 In the Cryo- gene bank, 113 accessions of seeds and pollen genomic resources of different crop species were successfully cryo-preserved, making the total collection of 11,839 accessions belonging to 850 species. In addition, 80 genomic resources were cryo-banked, making the total to 2,194. Germplasm exchange: A total of 159,687 samples were imported from more than 23 countries including 31,226 germplasm accessions and 154,601 samples of CGIAR trial/nurseries. A total of 968 samples were exported under collaborative research projects. Important trait specific accessions that were imported are as follows: Wheat: wild wheat from Germany (EC1009520–1009548); paddy: landraces of rice from IRRI, Philippines (EC101559–101582), low amylose lines from Philippines (EC1030717–EC1030726); maize: genetics stocks in maize from USA (EC1040934–1040942); pulses: susceptible and resistant lines of chickpea, to five races of fusarium wilt, from USA (EC1023944–EC1023949); vegetables: improved chilli varieties (sweet pepper and hot pepper) namely redskin, liberty belle, atomic, longhorn, chenzo, garden pearl, loco, fire cracker, megabite and others (EC1030751–EC1030762) from UK; carotenoid rich lines of cucumber from USA (EC1024114–EC1024117), downy mildew resistance germplasm of cucumber from USA (EC1041437–EC1041438); oil seeds: high yield potential lines, herbicide tolerance to imidazolinone and high oleic acid composition in the seed oil and resistance to Sclerotinia and Phomopsis stem canker lines in sunflower from USA (EC1035329– EC1035331); soybean variety Polanka (EC1026157); fruits: avocado variety Gwen (EC1027328), cold tolerant avocado variety Fuerte (EC1027330); wild species of papaya Vasconcellea spp. from USA (EC993392– EC993397); and wild species of persimmon Diospyros digyna from USA (EC1033578–EC1033580). Besides, a total of 968 samples of wheat, taro and different leguminous crops were exported under collaborative research projects, out of which 5 accessions each of Dolichos were sent to Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Namibia, and Uganda and 211 samples of crops, namely Dolichos (50), mungbean (50), horsegram (50), cowpea (9), pigeonpea (2) and mothbean (50) were sent to Namibia under a collaborative research project. Germplasm characterization/evaluation: A total of 26,320 germplasm accessions were characterized for agro-morphological traits at New Delhi. Agro- morphologically diverse core set is being developed in lentil, cowpea, linseed, sesame and pea. Screening against biotic, abiotic stresses and herbicide resistance in different crops was done in 1,450, 1,130 and 2,000 accessions respectively. Biochemical evaluation of 3,200 accessions was undertaken in different crops for oil content, fatty acid profile, protein, sugar, minerals, amino acids, antioxidants and active principles.
