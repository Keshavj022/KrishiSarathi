Colony morphology of Phytophthora and Pythium s.l. isolates on PDA medium incubated for 7 days in the dark at 25 °C. P. acerina (a), P. cactorum (b), P. gonapodyides (c), P. megasperma (d), P. palmivora (e), P. plurivora (f), P. oleae (g), P. aphanidermatum (h), P. irregulare (i), and P. schmitthenneri (j). Agriculture 2025, 15, 435 7 of 15 Figure 4. Phylogenetic tree of Phytophthora and Pythium s.l. isolates associated with olive root rot. The tree was constructed using maximum-likelihood analysis of rDNA ITS gene sequences from the 21 isolates and reference sequences from GenBank. The Kimura two-parameter model was performed in MEGA 11 software (v11.0 13), with 1000 bootstrap replications to evaluate the tree. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences revealed that three Phytophthora species clustered within ITS clade 2, making it the most represented clade. Clade 6 included two species, while clades 1 and 4 were represented by one species each. Similarly, the Pythium s.l. species were distributed across three distinct clades (A, F, and E), highlighting the genetic diversity of the oomycete populations associated with olive root rot. Agriculture 2025, 15, 435 8 of 15 3.3. Pathogenicity The pathogenicity of all tested species was evaluated on olive saplings (var. Picholine Marocaine). Results demonstrated that both Phytophthora and Pythium s.l. species were pathogenic when inoculated into wounded plants (Figure 5). After three months, signiﬁcant diﬀerences in disease severity were observed among the tested species (Table 2). P. schmitthenneri was the most aggressive, causing 100% disease severity, followed by P. palmivora and P. plurivora, each with 92%. The remaining species exhibited variable disease severities, ranging between 50% and 75%. Figure 5.
