 Precision farming Technologies like AI enables precision farming, where plants are precisely monitored through real-time data collection and analysis. AI algorithms determine the precise amount of water, nutrients, and light required for optimal growth. This level of precision minimizes resource wastage and ensures that crops receive the ideal conditions precisely for their ideal growth and development. Data-Driven decision making Automated growth monitoring: In vertical farming systems, crops are often grown in compact, controlled environments where traditional methods of monitoring are inefficient. AI-powered cameras and sensors installed in vertical gardens collect real-time data about plant growth. These systems utilize image recognition software to analyze plant health and development by identifying factors such as leaf colour, texture, and growth patterns. AI algorithms compare this data with predefined healthy plant models, detecting early symptoms of diseases, nutrient deficiencies, or pest infestations. For example, yellowing leaves may indicate a nitrogen deficiency, while brown spots might signify fungal infections. AI can quickly identify such issues and recommend interventions, minimizing crop losses. Predictive crop modelling: AI-driven predictive models can simulate and optimize crop growth by analyzing large datasets, including historical data on plant performance, environmental conditions, and management practices. These models predict the ideal times for planting, pruning, and harvesting, based on specific crop requirements and current environmental conditions like light, temperature, and humidity. The goal is to maximize yields by adjusting growth schedules and managing environmental factors for individual crop. For example, leafy greens may require different light intensity than fruiting plants, and AI models can adjust light exposure accordingly. Water and nutrient management: AI modules designed for irrigation and fertigation management are equipped with moisture sensors that monitor the water levels in the growing medium. These AI systems use machine learning November–December 2024 43 algorithms to assess plant water needs based on factors such as growth stage, temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels. The system adapts irrigation schedules in real-time, ensuring that plants receive the optimal amount of water and nutrients, preventing both overwatering and nutrient leaching. Furthermore, AI-integrated fertigation systems deliver precise doses of nutrients, adjusting nutrient composition based on the plant’s growth stage and nutrient uptake rates, thereby improving nutrient-use efficiency. Climate control automation: Vertical farming systems are highly dependent on controlled environments to achieve consistent results, especially when growing crops year-round. AI modules automate climate control systems, managing variables like temperature, humidity, light intensity and CO2 levels.
