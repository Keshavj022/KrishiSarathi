 For embryo rescue, interspecific crossed bolls with immature developing ovules were brought to the lab, surface sterilized with 70% alcohol for 3-5 min followed by thorough washing in distilled water 3 times with 2-3 min each. Bolls were treated with 0.1% HgCl2 for 5-10 min followed by thorough washing in distilled water 3 times with 2-3 min each. Ovules were carefully detached from the ovaries and placed on to the modified solid culture medium succeeded in establishing more than 100 healthy seedlings from interspecific crosses. Seed technology During 2016-17, total breeder seed production in field crops was 121,988.5 q against the indent of (a) Interspecific cross between G. hirsutum and G. arboreum; (b) crossed bolls. Established interspecific F1 hybrid seedlings through embryo rescue technique. (b) (a) CROP IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017â€“18 45 104,045.7 q (production comprises 83,105.0 q against GOI indent of 67,463.3 q; 25,476.9 q against state indent of 24,378.1 q and additional production of 13,406.5 q against ICAR Seed Project targets of 12,204.3 q). The major share in total breeder seed production belongs to cereal crops 70,092.8 q against indent of 51,440.7 q. Under pulse crops, a total of 20,578.1 q breeder seed was produced against the indent of 18,018.9 q. In oilseeds, total breeder seed production was 30,288.3 q against the indent of 33,692.9 q. Breeder seed produced in case of fiber crops was 130.8 q against the indent of 83.2 q and in forage crops, 898.48 q was produced against the indent of 810.0 q. In order to promote Seed Replacement Rate (SRR) and Varietal Replacement Rate (VRR), to equip seed production centers of NARES with world-class infrastructure and to make quality seed available to the farmers by means of model deployment, ICAR Seed Project entitled, Seed Production in Agricultural Crops is being implemented under the aegis of ICAR. During the year 2016-17, total production of quality seed including all classes was 620,743 q against the target of 462,404 q. Production comprises 124,576 q of foundation seed, 273,681 q of certified seeds, 981,99 q of truthfully labelled seed and 30,422 q of planting material of field crops. In addition, 239 lakh planting material and 1.9 lakh tissue culture plantlets were produced against the targets of 288 and 2.6 lakh, respectively. Horticulture Fruit crops: In guava, CISH-G-14, a half-sib of cv. Allahabad Safeda was found promising. The variety has 12.5 oBrixTSS. It is soft- seeded (breaking force 12 kg) with attractive appearance. In aonla, Aonla - CISH A-33, a seedling selection having large-sized fruits (32-35 g), promising in terms of yield (55.45 kg/tree), rich in neutraceuticals (ascorbic acid 490.13 mg/100 g; polyphenols 1.718 TAE g/100 g and FRAP value 235.76 mg/g FeSO4) was identified. In banana, cv. Udhayam is one such recalcitrant type where bacterial contamination is a major problem hindering multiplication through tissue culture.
