 Intercropping : Under agro‐climatic situations of north and central zone, the intercropping of 2 rows of forage sorghum / pearl millet (25 cm row to row spacing) in pigeonpea planted at 75 cm realizes significantly higher (40‐45 percent) fodder equivalent yield and net monetary return than sole stands. 2. Nutrient management in forage crops and forage based crop sequences • In south zone, the inoculation of Azospirillum to forage maize increases green fodder (2.0%) and dry matter yield (2.8%) and net monetary return (29.4%) over control ( no fertilizer). • Application of molybdenum (Mo) @ 0.5 kg/ha and boron (B) @ 2.0 kg/ha to Berseem increase the seed yield by 20‐23 per cent over control in the deficient soils during initial years in North west zone. • In Lucerne growing areas of western region, the supplementation of molybdenum (Mo) @ 1.0 kg/ha and boron (B) @ 2.0 kg/ha to lucerne increase the seed yield by 15‐25 per cent over control in the deficient soils during initial years. • At Bikaner, Pearl millet‐oat‐cowpea fertilized with 75% recommended dose of NPK+10 t/ha FYM in kharif season was best in terms of forage yield (Green fodder‐624.9 q/ha and dry matter‐146.2 q/ha) and net monetary return (Rs. 31288/ha/year). www.icar.org.in 35 2002 ‐ 2007 3. Weed control in forages • Application of Fluchloralin @ 0.90 kg a.i./ha PPI produced highest green fodder (658.5 q/ha) and dry matter (84.8 q/ha) of shaftal dominated with Poa annua and recorded remarkable weed control efficiency (65.9%) in north‐west region. 4. Forage production from problem soils • In acidic soil, the application of 40 kg P/ha as single super phosphate (SSP) enhances the green fodder yield of cowpea and ricebean by 26.2 and 45.3 per cent, respectively over control. It shows equal effect with the application of 20 kg P/ha + FYM @ 0.5 t/ha. • In alkali soil, application of gypsum to rice and 90 kg P2O5 /ha to berseem yielded significantly higher green fodder ( 885 q/ha) and dry matter ( 146 q/ha) of berseem than the other treatments, closely followed by pyrite application. • In acidic soil , application of lime + recommended dose of P & K + VAM to Kharif & Rabi in Rice bean‐Oats sequence produced highest forage yield (green fodder‐541.9 q/ha & dry matter‐114.6 q/ha) and realized highest net monetary return (Rs. 13905/ha/year). • In acidic soil (pH < 5.5) at Bhubaneswar, intercropping of Ricebean (Fodder) + Maize (Grain) in row ratio of 2:2 after liming (100% LR) realizes higher forage equivalent yield (467.5 q/ha) with percentage increase of 275 over rice bean without liming. 5. Intensification of forages after rice • In central and North West Zone, Berseem sown after rice with optimum tillage produces superior forage yield than no tillage. However, in North East Zone, Berseem sown in standing rice crop with no tillage and 50 kg seed/ha produces 15.0 per cent higher forage yield.
