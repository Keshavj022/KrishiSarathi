 Climate change and resilient agriculture: A district level vulnerability map of Indian agriculture to climate change was updated with 5th Assessment Report (IPCC 2014) climate projections. Climate resilient integrated organic farming system model (one ha) was developed for small and marginal farmers for semi-arid region and sloppy land of NEH region. The carbon footprint of milk production for small (2–3 cattle), medium (4– 6 cattle) and large dairy (>10 cattle) farmers was calculated as 1.03, 1.01 and 1.27 kg CO2-eq/kg FPCM (Fat Protein Corrected Milk) respectively. An excel based model was developed for life cycle assessment of greenhouse gas from dairy farms of Karnataka. The estimation of annual enteric methane emission revealed that livestock at national level emit about 2.62 Mt methane/km2. In Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh more enteric methane is produced than the national average owing to dense livestock population (t204/km2). A comprehensive database of differentially expressed miRNAs in cattle during thermal stress was developed. Broiler litter was found to be a methanogenic substrate, but hatchery and slaughter wastes and dead birds were suitable for composting. Genetic resources: Important plant genetic resources collected include cold tolerant barley and wheat (46) and Allium spp. (21) from Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir; landraces of paddy (93), taro (10), chilli (9), 1. Overview DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 1 DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 2 OVERVIEW cowpea (12) and urd (8) from Assam, rice landraces (32) from Manipur, rice landraces (28) and legumes (mainly urd and pigeon pea) from Meghalaya; rice landraces (15) from Upper Siang, Arunachal Pradesh; vegetables (189) from Tripura; maize (11) from Mizoram; cucurbits (65) from Bihar; coriander (54) from Madhya Pradesh; and tropical underutilized minor fruits (39) from Goa and Konkan regions. Overall 2,623 accessions were collected during this year from 23 explorations. The National Herbarium of Cultivated Plants (NHCP), New Delhi has a total of 23,942 specimens of which 376 sepcimens have been added during the reporting period. Currently the base collection of National Genebank has a total of 4,42,909 accessions with the addition of 12,417 accessions during this year. The in vitro Genebank, has a total collection of 1,879 accessions in the form of ~38,000 in vitro cultures of 54 genera of which 24 accessions have been added during the reporting period. In the Cryogenebank, 491 accessions of seeds pollen and genomic resources of different crop species were successfully cryopreserved, leading to total collection of 13,814 accessions belonging to 820 species. A total of 1,59,687 samples were imported from 40 countries, and 2,041 samples were exported under various collaborative research projects.
