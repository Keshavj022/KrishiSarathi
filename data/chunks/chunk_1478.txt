 In addition to local engagement, effective water governance must focus on promoting equitable access to harvested water, ensuring that all community members benefit from the available water resources. Policies and regulations should also emphasize on sustainable use of both surface and groundwater resources to prevent over-extraction. Reuse of harvested water for supplemental irrigation In rainfed agricultural regions, the reuse of harvested rainwater for supplemental irrigation is a critical strategy for enhancing water security and improving crop productivity. Supplemental irrigation addresses this challenge by providing additional water when natural rainfall is insufficient, particularly during sensitive periods such as flowering, fruit development, and grain filling. The reuse of harvested water for supplemental irrigation offers a reliable alternative to groundwater extraction. Effective reuse of harvested water for supplemental irrigation involves the application of water-saving irrigation techniques (sprinkler, surface drip, sub-surface drip and rain gun) that maximize the efficiency of water use. Micro-irrigation is one of the most efficient methods, as it delivers water directly to the root zone of plants, minimizing water loss through evaporation or runoff. Soil moisture based micro- irrigation is an advanced method that ensures that plants receive just the right amount of water, helping to reduce the waste and optimize the use of harvested water. Conjunctive use of surface and groundwater, and ground water sharing Conjunctive use refers to the coordinated and planned utilization of both surface water (such as rivers, ponds, and reservoirs) and groundwater (from wells and aquifers) in a way that optimizes the use of both sources. This approach helps farmers to meet their water needs more efficiently by balancing the use of surface and groundwater resources according to availability, demand, and environmental conditions. Successful implementation requires careful planning, management, and governance to ensure sustainability and equity. Over-extraction of either resource can lead to environmental and social consequences, such as the drying up of rivers or the depletion of community wells. Therefore, effective water governance is essential to regulate the allocation and use of water, prevent conflicts over resources, and promote practices that protect both surface and groundwater systems. Another challenge is the variability of surface water availability in rainfed regions. During periods of heavy Indian Farming 17 January 2025 rainfall, surface water supplies may be abundant, but during extended dry spells, they can become scarce. In such cases, communities must rely more heavily on groundwater, increasing the risk of over-extraction. To manage this dynamic balance, local water management systems must be designed to allow for flexible switching between surface and groundwater use depending on seasonal and climatic conditions.
