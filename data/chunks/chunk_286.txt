 Northeast plains region, encompassing central and eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam, has historically been a traditional habitat for long-duration pigeonpea cultivation. This crop typically takes 8-9 months from sowing to harvesting and was traditionally grown under rainfed conditions in mixed or intercropping systems, often alongside tall cereals like maize, sorghum, and minor millets.

This traditional cropping system, predominantly practiced in upland areas, not only ensured dietary diversity but also helped in maintaining the soil fertility. However, with the onset of the Green Revolution, sole cropping of semi-dwarf varieties of rice and wheat became prevalent, replacing the traditional mixed cropping system. This shift in agricultural practices posed tough competition to the less lucrative mixed cropping, particularly popular maize-potato intercropping system in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Additionally, unpredictable rainfall patterns resulting in unstable yields of arhar (pigeonpea) forced farmers to explore alternative cropping systems. This ongoing transition contributed to a continuous decline in acreage devoted to arhar cultivation. In 2017-18, arhar cultivation area in Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal had decreased by more than 51% and 82%, respectively, compared to levels in 1970-71. In Bihar, the arhar cultivation area had dwindled to 66.2 thousand hectares, a 56% reduction by 1990-91. Even after the partition of Bihar, the area dedicated to arhar cultivation continued to decline, reaching an all-time low of 18.49 thousand hectares in 2017- 18. This declining trend was not limited to arhar alone but extended to all pulse crops in the most states of NEP, except for Jharkhand. Adverse effects of rice-wheat system on agricultural productivity have become increasingly evident. Arhar, being rich in protein and densely packed with essential micronutrients such as iron and zinc, gradually became less accessible in regular diet of low-income individuals who had limited access to animal sources of protein and micronutrients. All these factors have sparked renewed interest in diversifying current narrow cropping systems to enhance overall system productivity, maintain soil health, and combat micro-malnutrition. This entails the incorporation of arhar and other pulses into the cropping system.
