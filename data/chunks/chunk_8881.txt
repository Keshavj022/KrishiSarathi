90 tonnes/ha) of wheat requiring 6 irrigations of 6 cm depth each. At Hisar, in sandy loam soils, under shallow water-table conditions, scheduling 6 cm irrigation at 60% depletion of available water requiring 3 irrigations produced 4.07 and 4.03 tonnes/ha wheat yield in PBW 343 and RJ 3765, respectively. Nitrogen schedule of 1/4 N at sowing + 1/2 of remaining at 35 DAS + remaining at 55 DAS was observed most appropriate. Under rice wheat cropping system, in slit clay loam soils at Pantnagar, late sown wheat (Cv UP-2338) receiving 6 cm irrigations at CRI + boot + milk stages of crop growth, produced 4.13 tonnes/ha grain yield under shallow water-table conditions. Favourable response of late sown wheat to nitrogen was observed up to 150 kg N/ ha in silt clay loam soils while 4 irrigations each of 6 cm depth to late sown wheat produced 2.76 tonnes/ha optimum wheat grain yield. Application of nitrogen @ 150 kg N/ha was observed to be optimum. Water Management for other Crops At Pusa, in sandy loam soils, two irrigations each of 5 cm depth to mustard at IW/CPE= 0.8 produced 1.57 tonnes/ha maximum seed yield with 41.8% oil content. Sulphur application @ 15 kg S/ha was observed to be optimum. At Rahuri, irrigation at 75 mm CPE to summer groundnut (Cv. TG-26) produced maximum pod yield of 3.50 tonnes/ha with 52% oil content. Use of 7 micron plastic mulch with spray of 8 per cent kaoline produced 3.53 tonnes/ha pod yield. At Faizabad, in silt loam soils, 5 light irrigations each of 3 cm depth besides two common irrigations each of 6 cm scheduled at 50 mm CPE produced 21.55 tonnes/ ha fruit yield of tomato (Cv. Narendra-2). Paired planting on raised beds proved better than other configurations. At Kota, in clay loam soils, 5 post sowing irrigations each of 6 cm depth scheduled at IW/CPE 0.8 besides a common irrigation of 10 cm produced 2.01 tonnes/ha optimum yield of dried red chillies. The crop gave a linear response to nitrogen application up to 160 kg N/ha. At Morena, in sandy loam soils, 7 light irrigations each of 2.5 cm depth scheduled at 30% depletion of available soil moisture produced 25.3 tonnes/ha bulb yield of onion. For higher productivity, onion must be planted in the second week of January. Whereas 8 light irrigations each of 4 cm depth scheduled at IW/CPE =0.8 to December planted onion, produced 36.9 tonnes/ha bulb WATER MANAGEMENT IN PULSES At Chiplima, in sandy clay loam soils, 4 irrigations each of 6 cm depth scheduled at IW/CPE 1.0 produced optimum seed yield (0.90 tonnes/ha) of rajmash. Sowing in the second week of November was observed to be appropriate. At Faizabad, in silt loam soils, 4 irrigations each of 5 cm depth scheduled at IW/CPE = 0.9 produced 2.26 tonnes/ha seed yield of rajmash. Application of 100 kg N/ha along with FYM @ 5 tonnes/ha was observed to be optimum. At Jorhat, in sandy loam soils, 6 m drain spacing produced maximum kharif moong seed yield of 0.92 tonne/ha.
