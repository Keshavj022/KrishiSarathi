The database is useful for monitoring the progress made by districts with introduction of developmental programmes/ schemes operated by state and federal governments. It enables the researchers in selecting rainfed regions/ low productivity regions for sample/ case studies. A screen shot of trend (using line diagram) in area sown, area sown with irrigation and productivity in cotton in Warangal district of Telangana generated from web enabled Database Management System, was prepared. Decision support system to bridge yield gaps in major rainfed crops: The Decision Support System (DSS) was developed for accommodating 15 rainfed crops, viz. rice, sorghum, pearlmillet, maize, fingermillet, chickpea, pigeonpea, blackgram, greengram, groundnut, soybean, sunflower, sesame, castor and cotton. User has to select a crop and a SOIL AND WATER PRODUCTIVITY DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 15 district cultivating the crop. The DSS provides climate and available water-holding capacity (AWHC) of soil of district and share of irrigated area and of a particular season (in rice, sorghum, maize, blackgram and greengram) in area under the crop and yield of the district. The DSS gives unreaped yield potential and its percentage to potential yield and nutrient use in terms of N, P, and K and extent of adoption of HYVs in target district.
