 arboreum x G. herbaceum) released in 1990 and high yielding G. herbaceum cotton genotype G. Cot. 21 released in 2001 proved to be well adapted to coastal areas of Gujarat. Bt cotton in India has proved to be a game-changer as its area witnessed a sharp rise after 2002 (Jayaraman 2002). The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) approved the commercial cultivation of three Bt cotton hybrids of Mahyco (MECH 12, 164 and 184) in 2002. Later, RCH-2 hybrid of Rasi Seeds was approved in 2004. Cotton area got a boost from 7.7 Mha area in 2002-03 to 13.3 m ha area by 2020-21 with >93% share of Bt cotton hybrids (ISAAA 2020) (Fig. 4). ICAR-CICR developed and released nine. Indian Agriculture after Independence 102 Fig. 4. Area under cotton and Bt cotton in India Box 9: Great Adoption of Bt Cotton by Indian Farmers The Bt cotton containing Cry 1Ac Mon 531 event that confers resistance to Lepidopteron pests of cotton, was commercialized in India in 2002 after stringent assessment for bio-safety and profitability studies. Subsequently, Bollgard II containing cry1Ac and cry2Ab MON 15985 event was approved in 2006. The area under Bt cotton increased from 0.29 lakh hectares in 2002-03 to 11.13 Mha (91.4% of the cotton area) in 2011-12 making Bt cotton unarguably the fastest technology adopted by Indian farmers. During 2020-21, around 12.29 Mha (94.1%) of the 12.95 Mha under cotton is under Bt cotton along with associated agro-techniques propelled India to become the world’s largest producer and the largest exporter of raw cotton. The insecticide usage for the control of bollworms declined from 9410 metric tonnes in 2001 to 121 Mt in 2013 (Kranthi 2014). It also improved the socio-economic status of 6 million farm families.
