 In general the productivity is low in north coastal districts due to low fertility status of soils in adequate irrigation and poor facilities, adoption of improved varieties and management practices. This zone receives a rainfall from 1100 to 1400 mm. Horticultural crops, millets, pulses, chillies, turmeric and pepper are the important crops grown. Strategy and Interventions for North Coastal Zone & High Altitude and Tribal areas Strategy 1: Productivity Enhancement   Introduction of flood tolerant MTU & RGL paddy varieties   Reviving rice fallow pulses with introduction of Yellow Mosaic Virus disease tolerant varieties in black gram and green gram.   Establishment of seed hub for pulses in Srikakulam for production of 1000q/year.   Promotion of sugarcane clones for rainfed situations in Visakhapatnam district with productivity of >75 tonnes/ha   Introduction of high yielding varieties of sesame with a productivity of >1 ton/ha e.g., YLM-136   Replacement of seedling orchards with grafts in Cashew & rejuvenation of aged orchards of mango, cashew, guava Strategy 2: Cost reduction   Paddy + Fish IFS model   Direct sowing of paddy using drum seeder in uplands to reduce costs   Zero till cultivation of rabi maize   Green manuring and organic production of paddy   Soil test based nutrient application in paddy, maize, sugarcane   Integrated pest management practices in paddy, pulses, sugarcane and oilseeds   Establishment of nurseries for pro- tray production and supply of vegetable seedlings   Farm mechanization - Power tillers, Power weeders, Paddy threshers, Maize Sheller, power operated paddy reapers and harvesters State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 10 Strategy 3: Quality Improvement / Processing/ value addition/ niche markets   Millets – primary processing & value addition.   Good agricultural practice of trellising in vegetable crops ( tomato, brinjal, cucumber, capsicum) for increasing good quality marketable produce yield upto 80% and quality by 20%   Cultivation of open pollinated chilli varieties (LCA-625) to reduce costs and increase profitability   Organic jaggery production   Organic coffee in high altitude tribal areas   Value added products from Palmyrah Strategy 4: Generation of additional income   Mother units / small hatchery units for backyard Poultry improved breeds of Srinidhi, Rajeshwari, Gramapriya etc.   Efficient feed management utilizing crop residues like maize stover, straws of legume crops etc for dairy   Cluster farming @500-1000 broiler birds by 8-10 youth in low cost housing   Year round fodder production with hybrid napier and guinea grass   Semi-intensive sheep production in Horti-pastoral system (mango)   Intercropping/ multi-storied cropping in coconut and oilpalm with banana, pineapple, black pepper, turmeric, yam, colocasia, cocoa, long pepper, heliconia, red ginger with a cost benefit ratio ranging between 2.18 to 2.
