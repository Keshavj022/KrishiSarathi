 Citrus plantations Advanced Sensing and Imaging Technologies for Detection of Maturity Indices Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) A non-destructive method for assessing fruit ripeness by analyzing sugar content and other internal quality parameters. This helps in accurate determination of the best harvest time without damaging the fruit. NIR is used to assess the sugar content and maturity of apples and peaches, helping farmers to plan harvest operations at the optimal time for better quality and market prices. Apple, Peach Hyperspectral Imaging Uses light in different wavelengths to assess fruit ripeness and internal quality parameters like sugar content and acidity levels. This technology helps farmers pick fruits at the peak of ripeness, ensuring better quality. Mango and banana growers in Maharashtra use hyperspectral imaging to detect ripeness without physically touching the fruit. This technology is especially beneficial for export markets, where uniform ripeness is critical. Mango, Banana etc. Thermal Imaging Cameras Thermal cameras detect temperature differences in crops, allowing farmers to monitor crop stress and fruit maturity. These cameras help in identifying when fruits are ready for harvest by measuring heat signatures. Farmers use thermal cameras to assess water stress and monitor fruit ripening, enabling them to optimize irrigation and plan timely harvests for better quality fruit. Pomegranate, Grapes November–December 2024 65 Application of digital tools in horticulture–Success stories Success Story 1: Revolutionizing crop protection with drone technology KVK, Gurugram conducted drone-based spraying demonstrations across various villages in the district to raise awareness and promote the use of drone technology in horticultural crops among farmers. A total of 19 demonstrations were carried out, covering 19 hectares of farmers’ fields in the villages of Gurugram district during 2023 (Table 2). The demonstrations were conducted on crops such as cauliflower, cucurbits and okra, where drones were used to spray insecticides, pesticides, and nutrient solutions on a rental basis. Across all crops, drone spraying consistently resulted in greater pest reduction and slightly higher yields compared to traditional manual spraying (Table 3), indicating Table 2. Demonstrations conducted in Gurugram district Date Name of village Block Area covered under demonstration (ha) No. of farmers participated Pesticide/ Nutrient applied 14-15 March, 2023 Uncha Majra, Safeda Nagar Pataudi 19.0 28 Pesticide and nutrient application in cucurbit, cauliflower, okra that drone technology is more efficient in terms of both pest control and productivity. Farmers in Gurugram district typically spend ` 625 per hectare on manual spraying, which takes around 30 minutes per hectare, while drone spraying completes the task in just 15 minutes.
