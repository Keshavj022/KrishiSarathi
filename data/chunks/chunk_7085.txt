 The map was utilized to identify 15 quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with drought traits Location of QTLs on the genetic linkage map of chickpea developed from the cross Pusa 362 × SBD 377. QTLs are depicted as coloured vertical bars to the right of the linkage groups. MSI (Membrane Stability Index), RWC (Relative Water Content), SW (100 Seed Weight) and YLD (Yield under stress condition). (Contd...) Variety Area of adoption Characters CROP IMPROVEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 57 (membrane stability index, relative water content, seed weight and yield under stress condition) accounting for phenotypic variations ranging from 11.8–27.1%. Phenomics of transpiration and water-use efficiency in rice: At Nanaji Deshmukh Plant Phenomics Centre (NDPPC), New Delhi, ML and AI aided Computer Vision methods such as SpikeSegNet for spike detection and counting in wheat, and leaf tip detection and counting methods in rice were developed in collaboration with ICAR–IASRI, New Delhi and IIT, Mumbai. Towards mapping of QTLs for components of transpiration and water use efficiency, 170 RILs of BVD109 × IR20 of rice were precision phenotyped. This set was also genotyped with 50K SNP genotyping Chip. Under irrigated conditions, three QTLs (qWUE 8.3 and qWUE 6.1 and qWUE 6.2) for WUE with PVE of 17.43%, 10.32% and 16.98% were mapped on chromosome 8 and 6, respectively. In confirmation to this, three QTLs related to day time water-use efficiency (qWUEd 6.2 and qWUEd 8.4 and qWUEd11.5) also located very close in the same location with high PVE of 17.15%, 18.39%, 10.16%, respectively. QTL related to night time WUE was mapped successfully in chromosome 8 (qWUEn 8.2) with high PVE% of 13.02%. Under drought stress, two QTLs related to whole day transpiration rate (qTRBM 6.3 and qTRPSA 6.4) have been mapped in chromosome 6 with high PVE value of 31.84% and 34.12%, respectively. These QTLs will be useful to elucidate molecular basis and genetic improvement of WUE in rice. chromosomes with a very high N50 of 78.27 Mbp. In total, 34,680 protein-coding genes have been predicted in the guar (clusterbean) genome. The high-quality chromosome-scale clusterbean genome assembly will facilitate understanding of the molecular basis of galactomannan biosynthesis and aid in genomics-assisted breeding of superior cultivars. Identification of a QTL hotspot for transpiration and WUE traits in rice using phenomics Chromosome scale reference genome of cluster bean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba): A chromosome-scale reference genome assembly of clusterbean, from a high galactomannan containing popular guar (clusterbean) cultivar, RGC 936 was done. The initial assembly of 1,580 scaffolds with an N50 value of 7.12 Mbp was generated. Then, by anchoring these scaffolds to a high- density SNP map, a genome assembly of 550.31 Mbp was obtained in 7 pseudomolecules corresponding to 7 (a) The 31-mer frequency distributions of the sequencing reads, (b) The cluster bean genome features.
