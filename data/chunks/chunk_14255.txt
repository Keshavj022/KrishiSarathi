 The increase in temperature upto 4 ◦C does not bring the temperature to the optimum temperature, after which the yield might decrease. The model yield predictions are applicable to irrigated medium duration (130 days) rice varieties plan­ ted in September. The optimum temperature for rice was taken as 30 ◦C (TNAU, 2020). For temperatures higher than this optimum temperature, there will be uncertainty in simulations of biomass and phenological development (Wang et al., 2017). 4.4.2. System risks due to climate change and variability To understand whether the future climate conditions generated by incrementing the aridity index and climate variability is in fact a plau­ sible one, the projections of the selected climate models under both RCPs and in both future periods, were overlayed on the stress response surface (Fig. 18). Climate projections are indicated as black dots in the figure and historical value as white diamond. The range of climate futures has been constructed to take care of the uncertainty in projections and contributes to robustness in planning. To that end, the overlay has shown that future conditions are very much plausible to lead to failure. Historical yield ratio lies within the threshold limit, but all projections are below the threshold in both cases showing that the generated future conditions are plausible ones. Risks to the system are also defined as a function of impacts and plausibility. A risk matrix is created (Fig. 19), by categorizing the risks as low, medium, high and critical based on the performance metrics and the plausibility or the number of RCM projections in both near and mid Fig. 13.

The categories chosen for classification of risk matrix is shown in Fig. 18. Accordingly, in the case of yield ratio, 13 projections come within 0.9 and the risk is classified as low. However, for supply–demand ratio, all future projections are below the threshold value and hence all future climate conditions are plausible with a supply–demand ratio less than 1. All future conditions (40) will be having a supply demand ratio less than 0.9, and hence is at high risk to climate change and variability. Fig. 14.
