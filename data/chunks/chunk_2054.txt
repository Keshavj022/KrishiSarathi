 Furthermore, AI-enabled skills could aid in recognising and resolving a number of problems. This is especially helpful in the northern states, where smallholder farmers may not have access to new technologies yet largely depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. In general, Indian farmers in a variety of geographical settings are empowered by the integration of AI and IoT in irrigation systems to make well-informed decisions, maximise water use, and sustainably enhance agricultural results, all of which support the nation's food security and economic growth. In India, the use of AI and IoT-enabled irrigation systems can vary from small-scale installations on a single farm to extensive rollouts across whole agricultural districts. Using a local network or cloud-based platform, individual farmers, especially in southern India, may implement AI and IoT technologies on a small scale to optimise water usage and increase agricultural yields on their fields. In western states, agricultural groups or cooperatives may put in place medium-sized irrigation systems with AI and IoT capabilities that service several farms or areas of land. In order to gather data on crops, weather, and soil moisture, these implementations entail extending a network of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors over a wider region. Data is then analysed using AI algorithms to forecast and optimise resource management and irrigation scheduling. Large-scale installations of AI- and IoT-enabled irrigation systems across vast agricultural regions may be the result of government-led projects or collaborations with the private sector in states in central and northern India. These programmes seek to significantly increase agricultural output, modernise irrigation infrastructure, and improve water efficiency. In general, many criteria including the scale of the agricultural operation, the degree of technology adoption, and the accessibility of resources and infrastructure influence how AI and IoT-enabled irrigation systems are used in India. These technologies have the power to completely change the way water resources are handled, resulting in more resilient and sustainable farming methods, whether applied to individual farms or to large agricultural landscapes. Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report With the use of data analysis, artificial intelligence algorithms can create irrigation plans that are optimally tailored to the soil's characteristics and other variables. Farmers who live in areas with limited water supplies can increase crop yields while conserving water by using this precision irrigation technique. Furthermore, Al-enabled skills could aid in recognising and resolving a number of problems. This is especially helpful in the northern states, where smallholder farmers may not have access to new technologies yet largely depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.
