 Leucocytosis is the reactive response to an acute viral disease (Rosenberger, 1979). The post-treatment mean values of total leucocytes count of sick animals in treatment Groups I and II were 7,361.66 ± 99.70 and 5,670.00 ± 25.44/ml (Table 3). The mean values of total leucocyte count of sick animals showed no significant decrease when compared to apparently healthy group. For differential leucocyte count, Rosenberger (1979) stated that the normal absolute number of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils in cattle were 1,250 to 4,500, 2,250 to 6,500, 50-800 and 50 to 1,000/ml respectively. Their mean values of apparently healthy cattle in absolute number were 1,703.23 ± 16.52, 3,491.73 ± 24.49, 98.13 ± 6.75 and 76.87 ± 5.55/ml (Table 3). The pre-treatment mean values of neutrophils in sick animals of Groups I and II were 4,001.17 ± 36.49 and 3,988.17 ± 77.48/ml respectively (Table 3). The pre-treatment mean values of lymphocytes in sick animals of Groups I and II were 4,606.47 ± 37.04 and 4,573.40 ± 87.67/ml respectively (Table 3). The pre-treatment mean values of neutrophils and lymphocytes of foot and mouth disease affected cattle varied significantly from the mean of apparently healthy group. There was a marked response to neutrophils with lymphopenia in all the sick animals. These observations with increased total leucocyte count of all sick cattle indicate inflammatory reaction (Rosenberger, 1979).  VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY The post-treatment mean values of the total leucocyte (TLC), neutrophils and lymphocyte of sick animal in Groups I and II were found to be marginally higher than the normal values of apparently healthy cattle. The sick animals showed clinical recovery from the disease, but their haematological examination indicated the persistence of infection. All the 30 sick animals were treated for oral lesion in Group I with gingelly oil, pig fat and banana fruit mixture, twice a day for 7 days. Reduction of salivation in these animals was observed on the fifth day and healing oral and tongue lesions following its application. The animals in this group started consuming water and succulent grasses. There was no improvement in healing of foot lesion in animals treated with neem oil alone. There was no healing of foot lesion in animals treated with Gloriosa superba and liquid paraffin. Animals in subgroup C were treated for foot lesion with a mixture Gloriosa superba and neem oil for 7 days and the healing of lesion was appreciable and they exhibited lameness. In Group II of 30 animals, which received an application of boroglycerin for oral lesion twice a day for a period of 7 days, there was a remarkable reduction of salivation on the third day itself, and from the fourth day onwards the animal showed some interest in nibbling succulent grass and drinking water. Further, Lorexone ointment was applied twice a day for 7 days to the foot lesions for all the animals in Group II.
