 The positive features of these hill districts are that they have an enormous potential for off-farm income through eco-tourism and a suitable climate for high-value agriculture. These must be harnessed for a development strategy. Recently, the study conducted by ASSOCHAM jointly with the research firm RNCOS said, “The performance of Uttarakhand in agriculture and allied activities haves not been up to the mark as its share in the gross state domestic product (GSDP) had declined sharply from over 22% in 2004-05 to just over 9% in 2014-15,” Therefore, Uttarakhand needs to promote a separate hill farming policy as the State has a meager 14% net sown area, more so as three-fifth of the State’s total working population is engaged in agriculture. Low level of land holdings is a key challenge in the farm sector as 73.6% of the State’s farmers hold less than one hectare of land. The agriculture sector in the state recorded just about 3% Compound Annual Growth Rate between 2004-05 and 2014-15 (ASSOCHAM).

Creation of additional water storage tanks in Sult, Dwarahat, Syaldey and Tarikhet block for lean season. 2. Promotion of rain water harvesting and drip-fertigation system in vegetable clusters in this zone. 3. Creation of trenches for high percolation of water in slope/ terraces in all blocks of this zone. 4. Promotion of water conservation techniques like mulch, sprinkler and drip for juvenile plants in Dwarahat, Syaldey, Sult and Tarikhet blocks of this zone. 5. Popularisation of roof water harvesting system in all blocks of this zone. 6. Rejuvenation and popularisation of traditional water harvesting systems (Naula) in all blocks of this zone. Adoption of cluster approach for holistic development 1.
