 It leverages biomass to produce electricity and gas, positioning itself as a crucial component in decarbonization initiatives. Unlike other renewable energy sources, bioenergy not only generates green electricity but also extends utility to various energy sectors, including biogas-powered electricity, liquid biofuels, and hydrogen production. Biomass is a significant and abundant renewable energy resource, accounting for 50% of the total renewable energy portfolio [3]. The key characteristics include extensive availability, broad distribution, sustainability, and renewability. Biomass can be categorized into various types, including crops, forestry products, dedicated energy crops, animal and agricultural residues, industrial byproducts and waste, municipal solid waste, and sewage [4]. Agricultural residues and wastes represent the non-woody biomass category, as illustrated in the global biomass distribution pie chart (Figure 1). Various methods are available to produce energy from non-woody biomass with the selection depending on factors such as cost and raw material availability. Biomass is primarily converted into energy through two main processes: thermochemical and biochemical [5]. Thermochemical methods offer advantages like faster reaction times and higher conversion efficiencies, achieving complete lignin breakdown. These methods include pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, gasification, direct combustion, and torrefaction. Conversely, biological processes encompass anaerobic digestion, fermentation, and acidic hydrolysis. Figure 1. Global waste distribution [1]. Thermochemical conversion of agricultural residues offers a promising pathway for producing hydrogen, methane, and biofuels. Optimizing the production process requires a detailed understanding of process parameters, yields, and comparative evaluations of different technologies. Thermochemical conversion methods, such as pyrolysis and gasification, enable the transformation of biomass into valuable fuel products like hydrogen, methane, and biofuels. Pyrolysis, an advanced thermal treatment, converts biomass into syngas, which can be further refined into biofuels. This method is particularly effective for producing bio-oils with high energy density. For pyrolysis, the process parameters include a temperature range of 400–600°C, a heating rate of 10–100°C/min, and a residence time of 0.5–2 h [6]. The yields for pyrolysis include 35–50% bio-oil, 20– 30% biochar, and 15–25% syngas, with a productivity of 0.5–1.5 kg/h per kg of feedstock [7]. Gasification, on the other hand, is a promising technology that harnesses the energy within various biomass types and converts it into valuable products for diverse industrial uses.
