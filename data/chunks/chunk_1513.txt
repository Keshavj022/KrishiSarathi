 Keywords: Employment opportunities, Enhancing income, Integrated farming systems, Rainfed agriculture R AINFED agriculture constitutes a major part of Indian agriculture, covering about 51% of the country’s cultivated land and contributing approximately 40% of food production. This form of agriculture is complex and varies greatly due to unpredictable monsoon patterns, making it vulnerable to climate change impacts. Consequently, it experiences low productivity and requires a strategic, interdisciplinary approach to ensure food and nutritional security, alongside sustainable natural resource management. The Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) approach provides a holistic solution by combining multiple agricultural components such as crops, livestock, fisheries, and horticulture into a cohesive system. IFS aims to achieve minimal competition and optimal complementarity between components, leveraging advanced agronomic practices to sustainably increase farm income, improve family nutrition, and support ecosystem services. This system not only boosts farm productivity but also minimizes the need for external inputs through recycling within the system, which can reduce costs by up to 45%. By integrating diverse activities like field and horticultural crops, livestock, and poultry, IFS presents a resilient model for rainfed agriculture, helping farmers cope with the challenges posed by limited water resources and erratic rainfall. The IFS approach holds significant potential for increasing farmers’ incomes and supporting the livelihood of small-scale and marginal farmers by building a more stable and sustainable agricultural framework. Indian Farming 75 (01): 40-42; January 2025 Key features of rainfed IFS • Soil and water conservation practices: Rainfed IFS emphasizes in-situ moisture conservation techniques such as contour farming, bunding, and mulching. Water harvesting structures like farm ponds and percolation tanks are also commonly used to capture and store rainwater, enabling crop growth during dry spells. • Systems of diverse cropping: Rainfed IFS encourages intercropping, crop rotations, and mixed cropping with drought-tolerant varieties suited to local climatic conditions. Common combinations include cereal-pulse or cereal-oilseed systems that make efficient use of water and nutrients. • Livestock integration: Including livestock like goats, poultry, sheep, and cattle in rainfed farming systems serves as a buffer against crop failures. Livestock provides a steady income source through the sale of milk, meat, eggs, and manure, which can also be used to enrich soil fertility. • Horticulture and agroforestry: The inclusion of fruit trees and forage crops enhances system productivity and adds a variety of produce that can be sold or consumed. Agroforestry improves soil moisture retention, reduces soil erosion, and increases biomass availability.
