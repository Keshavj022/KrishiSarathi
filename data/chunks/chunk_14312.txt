 Crop management practices The experimental particulars and attributes of crop varieties are shown in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Before Table 1 Soil characterization in the 0–15 cm soil depth before the start of the experiment (2020), the methods and references used for each soil parameter analyzed.

K. Nthebere et al. Heliyon 11 (2025) e41196 3 sowing of the crops (cotton and maize), the field was plowed twice followed by rotovation and levelling field operators in conven­ tionally tilled (T1) plots, whereas in no-till (ZT) plots, seeds dibbling was performed. For Sesbania, sowing was done directly in solid rows (30 cm spacing) between the maize stubbles in the T2 and T3 treatments without any tillage operations. Conversely, the CT (T1) plots were fallowed during summer i.e., there was no Sesbania in such plots. This distinction in management practices reflects the specific treatments applied to each plot in the experimental design. The crops particularly cotton and maize were raised in accordance with recommended dose of fertilizers (RDFs), cultural practices and typically advanced with rainfall in monsoon and supplemental irrigation in winter. At 30 days after sowing (DAS), Sesbania rostrata was knock-down and removed in the T2 while in the T3, shrub master was used to shred and retain Sesbania as surface mulch to the soil. The details on the dates of sowing and harvesting for each crop are presented in Supplementary Table 4. 4. Sampling 4.1.
