Quantity of exudates: Quantity of exudates was scored as per the method of Bigbie et al. (1991): 0=none (apparently dry wound); 1=slight (wound is moist but no oozing on pressing the 3. Peripheral swelling: Peripheral swelling was recorded as follows at weekly intervals: 0=nil; 1=moderate; and 2=marked wounds); 2=moderate (wound is moist and slight oozing on pressing the wound); and 3=extreme (exudate is visible and pressure leads to excessive 4. Warmth and pain: Warmth around the affected area was compared with that of the normal area by touching with palm. This was done by the same person at 10.30 am. The warmth was graded as per the 1a.

Pain on manipulation of the area was recorded as: 0=no pain on extensive manipulation; 1=pain on extensive manipulation; 2=pain on moderate manipulation; and 3=pain on slight manipulation. 6. Colour of wounds: Colour of wounds grossly depicts the status of healing and was scored as follows: 1=pale yellow, 2=pale red; and 3=pink 7. Area of wound: Area of wound was recorded at 7_day intervals as per the method described by Kumar and Tyagi (1972). Margins of wound, area of granulation and area of epithelialization was marked and the percentage of healing was calculated. Finally time taken for complete healing was recorded. 8. Granulation tissue evaluation: At each dressing change the granulation tissue was categorized according to the standards (Bigbie et al. 1991): 1=grade I (granulation tissue depressed below skin edges); 2=grade II (granulation tissue proliferated to the level of skin edges); 3=grade III (granulation tissue elevated above skin edges); and 4=grade IV (elevated above skin edges, projecting over the advancing border of epithelium). 9. Scab formation: Scab formation was evaluated according to the scheme suggested by Jean et al. (1985). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Field survey using PRA matrix was conducted in the villages of Bareilly district. The results (scores out of 10) on different criteria both for ITK as well as for allopathic medicine are given in Table 1. Table 1.
