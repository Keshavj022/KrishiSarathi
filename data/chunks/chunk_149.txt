 Objectives The objectives of the project ‘Out-scaling of Natural Farming through Krishi Vigyan Kendra’ are promoting the widespread adoption of natural farming practices across India, eliminating or minimizing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture, encouraging the utilization of locally available resources for nutrient management and pest control, enhancing the economic viability of farming by reducing production costs and increasing farmers’ net incomes, improving agricultural productivity and overall farm profitability, building resilience to climate change and environmental degradation in agriculture, popularizing integrated farming approaches that incorporate sustainable agriculture and animal husbandry practices, facilitating knowledge dissemination and capacity building among farmers to adopt natural farming techniques effectively, collaborating with stakeholders including farmers, agricultural experts, and policymakers to promote sustainable agriculture practices, and contributing to environmental sustainability by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preserving natural resources. Major components of natural farming • Beejamrit, an ancient and sustainable agricultural technique, is utilized for treating seeds, seedlings, or any planting material. This fermented microbial solution is rich in plant-beneficial microbes and is applied as a seed treatment to protect young roots from fungal infections. By colonizing the roots and leaves of germinating seeds, the beneficial microbes in beejamrit contribute to the healthy growth of plants, promoting their vigour and resilience. • Jivamrit, serves as a biostimulant by stimulating the activity of microorganisms in the soil and enhancing the activity of phyllospheric microorganisms when applied to foliage. It functions as a primer for microbial activity, initiating and supporting the growth of beneficial microbial communities in the soil and on plant surfaces. Additionally, Jivamrit contributes to the proliferation of native earthworm populations, further enriching the soil ecosystem and promoting soil health. • Mulching is the practice of covering the soil surface with a layer of material, which can include live crops or straw (dead plant biomass). This technique serves multiple purposes, including the conservation of moisture by reducing evaporation, moderation of soil temperature around plant roots, prevention of soil erosion by wind or water, reduction of runoff during rainfall events, and suppression of weed growth by blocking sunlight and hindering weed seed germination. Residue mulching also saves seeds from birds, insects, and animals. Overall, mulching is a valuable practice for promoting soil health, water conservation, and weed management. • Whapasa refers to the mixture of 50% air and 50% water vapour present in the pore spaces between soil particles.
