 These innovations have revolution- ized the way agricultural processes are managed, providing real-time insights and enabling precise actions to optimize crop growth and resource utilization. Table 7 lists some notable developments in smart sensor technologies for pre- cision agriculture. These developments have revolutionized precision agri- culture by offering farmers a data-driven approach to decision-making, resulting in enhanced resource efﬁciency, improved crop yields, and reduced environmental impact. As technology continues to advance, we can expect even more innovative smart sensor solutions to further transform agricultural practices. 4.1. Drone-Based Sensors: Remote Sensing and Aerial Data Acquisition. Drone-based sensors have become an integral part of remote sensing and aerial data acquisition, revolution- izing various industries, including agriculture, environmental monitoring, construction, and disaster management. Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), equipped with sophisticated sensors, have opened up new possibilities for data collection and analysis from above, offering unique advantages over traditional ground-based methods [29]. Figure 4 describes some of the key aspects of drone-based sensors and their applications: 1. Remote sensing capabilities: Drones are equipped with a range of sensors that can capture various types of data. Common sensors include RGB (red, green, blue) cameras for high-resolution imagery, multi- spectral and hyperspectral sensors for capturing speciﬁc bands of light related to vegetation health, thermal sensors for measuring temperature varia- tions, LiDAR (light detection and ranging) for gen- erating detailed 3D maps and more. 2. Aerial data acquisition: Drones offer a swift and efﬁ- cient means of gathering data from the air across vast areas that are typically challenging or time-intensive to access using traditional methods. This aerial per- spective allows for comprehensive data collection, making it well-suited for monitoring expansive agri- cultural ﬁelds, forests, coastlines, and infrastructure. 3. Precision agriculture: In agriculture, drone-based sen- sors are pivotal for precision farming. They deliver real-time data on crop health, soil moisture levels, nutrient distribution, and pest presence. Farmers can utilize this information to optimize strategies for irrigation, fertilization, and pest management, thereby increasing crop yields and minimizing resource usage. 4. Environmental monitoring: Drones equipped with various sensors serve as valuable tools for environ- mental monitoring. They can assess the health of ecosystems, detect changes in vegetation patterns, monitor water quality in lakes and rivers, track wild- life populations, and aid in identifying illegal activi- ties such as deforestation or poaching. 5. Infrastructure inspection: Drones equipped with high-resolution cameras and LiDAR sensors are employed for inspecting infrastructure tasks.
