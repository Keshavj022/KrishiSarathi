A recent study from seven European countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and Belgium) showed a strong correlation between veterinary antimicrobial use and antimi­ crobial resistance in food-producing animals [24]. However, the wide­ spread utilization of veterinary antimicrobials contributes significantly to antimicrobial resistance, with important consequences for animal health, and potentially human health [25]. In our study, it was reported that the 81.1 % of the animal feed additives were sourced from the open market without the input or recommendation of professionals. Feed labelling is sometimes misleading and does not list nutritional infor­ mation or ingredients including antimicrobials added and farmers may not know if commercially-purchased feed contains antibiotics [26]. This lack of awareness can result in unintended antibiotic exposure to ani­ mals and the environment, potentially contributing to the spread of AMR. Our study also sheds light on the environmental consequences of antibiotic use in animal feed. Additionally, antibiotics in animal feed that are not digested by the animals enter the soil sediments. Manure is another way that antibiotics enter the environment. The majority of manure produced by animal farms is used to fertilise the soil [27]. These findings emphasize the need for sustainable and responsible agricultural practices that reduce the environmental impact of antibiotic use. In our study, 67.9 % of the green feed for animals was homegrown and pesti­ cide use was also reported, indicating the potential presence of toxins arising from pesticide application in animal feed. It was reported in our study that government guidelines were not followed in the use of pes­ ticides which is concerning as a multicentric study from India has shown that pesticide residue poses serious concerns to human health [28]. The prevalence of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms that frequently cause infections in the community and healthcare facilities remains high in India [14]. One of the main factors determining the outcome of treatment is medication compliance, or taking medication as prescribed by the doctor. Self-reported adherence to prescribed medi­ cine was high (92.3 %) in our study which is similar to the findings reported by a cross-sectional survey [29].
