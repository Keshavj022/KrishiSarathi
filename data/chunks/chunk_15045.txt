 (1985) write, ‘‘New technologies may increase the seasonal demand for labor, so that adoption is less attractive for those with limited family labor or those operating in areas with less access to labor markets.’’ Journal of Development Economics 152 (2021) 102686 14 Y.

I run the pooled regression in Eq. (8), restricting attention to 𝛿1, the treatment effect on households further away from towns. I construct two measures of relative labor density: (1) an indicator that takes the value 1 if the labor density of a village is below the mean labor density of its surrounding villages (columns 1 and 5), and 0 otherwise (columns 2 and 6); (2) an indicator that takes the value 1 if the labor density of a village is lower than the labor density of its surrounding villages (columns 3 and 7), and 0 otherwise (columns 4 and 8). Outcome in Columns (1)–(4) is the total number of labor-days per cultivated acre. Outcome in Columns (5)–(8) is the total number of hired labor-days per cultivated acre. The regressions are conditional on households that are cultivating some land in both periods. Observations are weighted using 1999 sample weights. Standard errors, clustered at the village level, are reported in parentheses. *𝑝< 0.10, **𝑝< 0.05, ***𝑝< 0.01. measures of relative labor density: an indicator that takes the value 1 if the labor density of a village is below the mean labor density of its surrounding villages, and an indicator that takes the value 1 if the labor density of a village is lower than the labor density of all its surrounding villages. Results from this heterogeneity analysis are presented in Table 8. Consistent with my hypothesis, I find that the positive treatment effects on labor use (total labor-days and hired labor- days per acre of cultivated land) are driven by ‘‘labor shortage" villages that have relatively lower labor densities at baseline (columns 1, 3, 5 and 7) using either constructed measure. Third, I examine the reduced form effect of improved road connec- tivity on households’ ownership of bicycles and scooters, two important modes of transport in this setting, in Table 9.35 I construct indicators that equal 1 if the household reports owning a bicycle and scooter respectively.
