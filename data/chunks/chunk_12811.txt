 The phenomenon of climate change and aberrant weather conditions are major issues to be tackled with new innovations in crop improvement and production systems. Apart from these, the challenges are many, namely, nutritional security, need for new plant genotypes for diversified end uses, degradation of soil health, production deficit and gluts, lack of infrastructure in commodity value-chain, retail chains and organized market systems, farmer producer companies, and export promotion.   There is only 22% crossbred/ up-graded cattle and the rest 78% cattle are indigenous and low-productive in West Bengal.   Average milk yield of dairy animals available in West Bengal is below than the national average.   Lack of adequate scientific post-harvest storage facilities both for perishable and nonperishable agriculture produce is one of the problems associated with the agriculture production in the State. The storage capacity is considered to be grossly inadequate. Similar situation prevails in respect of cold storage facilities for perishable horticulture produce.   The annual post-harvest fruit and vegetable losses incurred by West Bengal, which is facing a 12 lakh metric-ton shortfall as far as cold storage capacity is concerned. Though 90 per cent cold storage facilities of the State is for potato crop and located in the potato growing regions, still it falls far below the requirement. At present 20-25 % of horticultural produce is wasted prior to reaching the consumer in the State and during the periods of rains losses of produce increased further.   There are many climate-related problems that people in West Bengal are already 640 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 facing, such as diminishing water resources and frequent natural disasters, which are likely to be further aggravated by the impending changes in the climate. In the present situation, a heavy rainfall lead to flood and a deficient rainfall could lead to drought. The paradox of flood and drought occur simultaneously almost every year, making agriculture highly vulnerable and unstable in many districts of the State. Every summer many parts of Purulia, Bankura, Paschim Medinipur, and Birbhum suffer water shortage with respect to the entire State. About 42% of the State area is flood prone and is manifested across the State by various modes. The devastating impact of natural calamities that we experienced in the recent past – Cyclone Aila in West Bengal, is fresh in our mind, and perhaps, are the warning signals of what is imminent in the future on account of climate change. With over 70% of Indian agriculture being rain fed and totally dependent on vagaries of monsoon and an equal percent of population depending agriculture for subsistence, the consequences of climate change could be to say the least, disastrous. There may be adverse impact of sea-level rise on coastal agriculture and settlements in the State.
