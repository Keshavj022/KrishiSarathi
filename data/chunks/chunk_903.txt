 This article aims to discuss the immediate need of shifting our focus to these crops and the identification and management strategies for the insect pests attacking them. Keywords: Insects, Management, Millets, Production M ILLETS are coarse grain cereals that are nutrient-rich, drought-tolerant and short-duration crops. India is the highest producer of millets, with a production of 10 lakh tonnes/year. They are cost- effective and provides food and fodder security to dryland and rainfed agriculture. Millets are the most secure crops for small farmers as they are the hardiest, most resilient and climate-adaptable crops in harsh, hot (up to 50°C), and drought environments. The majorly grown millets in our country are sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet, foxtail millet, kodo millet, little millet, proso millet and barnyard millet. The Sorghum is grown to a 4.6 mha (million hectare) area in the country with a production of 4.5 million tonnes and productivity of 1 tonnes/ha. India produces 19.85 lakh metric tonnes of finger millets from 11.94 lakh ha area. Foxtail millet and kodo millet are grown in 0.87 lakh ha and 1.96 lakh ha with the production of 0.66 lakh tonnes, 0.84 lakh tonnes, and Indian Farming 73 (03): 17-20; March 2023 productivity of 762 kg/ha and 429 kg/ha, respectively. Little millet, proso millet and barnyard millet are grown in 2.34 lakh ha, 0.41 lakh ha, 0.146 million ha with the production of 1.27 lakh tonnes, 0.22 lakh tonnes, 0.147 million tonnes and productivity 544 kg/ha, 531 kg/ha, 1034 kg/ha respectively. Health benefits and nutrient composition These grains are nutrient- rich and cereal substitutes. Due to their high digestibility, health benefits and mineral composition, they are highly recommended for diabetic and anemic patients. They regulates the blood glucose level, helps in weight loss, and is good for heart functioning. The nutrient composition of the majorly grown millets is enlisted in Table 1. Insect pests of millets Insects are major constraints in the production of millets. Correct identification and timely management of insects are important to protect the crops. It is very important that we should adopt an integrated pest- management approach and not spoil our miraculous crop with pesticide residues.
