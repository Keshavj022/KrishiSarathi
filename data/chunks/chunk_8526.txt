 The use of satellite WiFS data was found satisfactory to estimate the potato Muskmelon DMDR 2 Red-skinned potato hybrid MS/92-2105 TRANSGENICS OF POTATO Eighteen transgenics of Kufri Badshah encoding fused cry1 AB + cry1B gene and 20 transgenics from 4 cultivars with AmA1 gene providing better resistance to insects/ pests and nutritional qualities respectively, were developed. The osmotin gene from wild potato species, Solanum chacoense, was cloned and a part of the gene was also sequenced. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 60 acreage in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal using remote sensing and GIS. WiFS was found unsuitable in Bihar where it could not capture a large tract of potato area, which was being cultivated in small fields. An INFOCROP- POTATO model was developed following extensive sensitivity analysis and validation, which could satisfactorily simulate potato development, growth and yield both under potential (no stress of N and water) and sub-optimum (N and water) conditions. A computerized ‘management tool for identification and management of major potato pests and diseases’ was also developed. Varieties of potato, wheat and rice identified and recommended for cultivation in rice–potato–wheat system at Jallandhar (Punjab), Hisar (Haryana), Modipuram (western Uttar Pradesh), Faizabad (Eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Patna (Bihar) are as follows: Varieties of potato, wheat and rice suitable for rice–potato–wheat system Location/region Potato Wheat Rice Jalandhar (Punjab) Kufri Pukhraj PB 373 PR 106 Hisar (Haryana) Kufri Ashoka PB 373 Gobind Modipuram (Western Uttar Pradesh) Kufri Pukhraj PBW 226 Saket Faizabad (Eastern Uttar Pradesh) Kufri Ashoka Malviya 234 Narendra 97 Patna (Bihar) Kufri Ashoka PBW 226 Proagro 6107 POTATO BREEDERS SEED The CPRI, Shimla, supplied a total of 17,746.1 q and 14,28.20 q breeders’ seed from the plains and hills, respectively. Nearly 50,000 disease-free micro-tubers of 11 Indian varieties and 2 parental lines were produced in vitro at Shimla and supplied to regional stations at Jallandhar, Gwalior, Patna and Modipuram for net house multiplication. The emergence of micro-tubers was found to be between 25.4 and 54.1% depending upon the size of micro-tubers and variety and resulted in production of nearly 64,065 mini-tubers. l The potato germplasm has been en- riched by 77 new accessions. l MS/92-2105, a new potato hybrid is likely to be released. l About 18 transgenics of potato vari- eties have been developed l A computerized Management Tool for management of potato pests and dis- eases has been developed. l About 173 new accessions of vari- ous tubers have been added to germplasm l Four triploid cassava hybrids have been identified. l Sree Arun and Sree Varun, new sweet potato varieties, have been released. l About 30 tonnes of planting material of tuber crops was distributed to farm- ers.
