 These promising lines have already accomplished three years of testing and exhibited stable grain yield and other traits in North Eastern Plain Zone (NEPZ) of India (Table 1). The variety SHIKHAR (IPFD 19-1) has the average grain yield of 1917 Kg/ha in NEPZ with potential grain yield of 27 q/ha. It has portrayed a yield advantage of 24.72% and 28.83% over the best check variety SKNP 04-9 and HFP-4 in NEPZ, respectively. Additionally, it has demonstrated 44.14% yield superiority over the landmark variety HUDP-15 in the NEPZ. It is a dwarf and leaflet less type in growth habit with average plant stature of 74 cm. It has white flower, green glabrous stipules, spherical and creamish white smooth seed. It takes 120-125 days to mature, hence, comes under medium maturity groups and has medium bold seed size (18.0 g). The variety ARAPN (IPFD 19-3) also gave average yield of 1767 Kg/ha in NEPZ with yield potential of 26 q/ha. It has demonstrated a yield benefit of 14.96% and 18.75% over the best check variety SKNP-04-09 and HFP-4 in NEPZ, respectively. Moreover, it has also depicted 32.86% yield supremacy over the ruling check variety HUDP-15 in the NEPZ. It has white flower, green glabrous leaves, spherical and creamish white smooth seed. It has medium maturity duration with average of 122 days and medium bold seeds (18.55 g). The field pea crop performance is adversely affected by fungal diseases like powdery mildew, rust and ascochyta blight in terms of grain quality and grain yield. Therefore, dedicated efforts were made to incorporate the resistance/tolerance against the above mentioned biotic stresses which will certainly help in realization of actual yield potential of variety. Shikhar and Arpan varieties demonstrated resistance reaction to powdery mildew as well as ascochyta blight and moderate resistance reaction to rust (Table 2). Furthermore, both varieties were Table 1.
