 None of the rice pests crossed ETL and based on this, 826 advisories and 68,670 SMS were sent under ICT based project in Tripura. Large scale integrated pest management validation conducted in 10 ha in Perambalur (Tamil Nadu) resulted in higher yield of 1,650 kg/ha and 2.87 CBR in IPM as against yield of 902 kg/ha and CBR of 1.62, respectively, in farmers’ practice. IPM implementation in cotton in whitefly hot spot of Fazilka, Punjab resulted in significant reduction in chemical pesticides from nine sprays (5.625 kg a.i./ha) in FP to 3 sprays in IPM (0.537 kg a.i./ha) with higher yield. IPM validation also resulted in conservation of natural enemies. IPM technology validated in bulb onion in Pune district, Maharashtra resulted in reduced chemical pesticide sprays to 3 from 10 in FP, and higher CBR of 1:2.1 in IPM from 1:1.71 in FP. Low but clean and better quality onion of 300 q/ha was recorded in the organic trial. Adoption of IPM technology in cucumber crop resulted in reduced pesticide usage to five sprays from nine sprays in farmers’ practices in Karnal, Haryana. FP fields recorded only 29.6 t/ha compared to 32.1 t/ha in IPM fields. Guava: For the control of guava tea mosquito bug, Beauveria bassiana (IIHR formulation) in talc formulation (10 g/l) or wettable formulation (1 g/l) effectively reduced the fruit damage percentage (15%) with a benefit cost ratio of 2.35 compared to the standard check (Lamdacyhalothrin-0.05%) recording 25.60% of fruit damage at Tinsukia. Litchi: An integrated mite management package in litchi comprising two sprays of chlorfenapyr 10 EC (0.03%) or Spiromesifen 22.9 SC (0.034%) at 15 days interval during July and pruning of affected twigs (in October) was standardized. For successfully managing CROP MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 73 the litchi nut borers with higher yield, two sprays of flubendiamide 39.35 SC @ 0.2 ml/l or spinosad 45 SC @ 0.32 ml/l or novaluron 10 EC @ 1.5 ml/l water at an interval of 7 days starting from the colour break stage of the fruit were recommended. Plantation crops Coconut: Bio-suppression of rugose spiralling whitefly (RSW) by conservation biological control using Encarsia guadeloupae, in situ preservation of sooty mould scavenger beetle Leiochrinus nilgirianus and adoption of palm health management strategies (nutrition and water) were developed. More than 50% of the hard scales were found parasitized by the aphelinid parasitoid, Aphytis sp. and the population of the parasitoid was considerably higher in the coconut scale insect inflicted garden. Besides, Chilocorus nigritus, Sasajiscymnus sp., and Pharoscymnus horni and their grubs were recorded feeding voraciously on scales at Kayamkulam, Alappuzha, Kerala. A simple nylon net covering in the entry points of the pest, viz. spear leaf base and adjoining axils proved effective in reducing the rhinoceros beetle damage to seedling of coconut. Leaf damage was reduced from 62.18 to 25.49%.
