Received 25 January 2006; revised accepted 8 October 2007 1847 1.5 ANNEXURE-III-A Discussion with Drs. I.S. Katageri, B.M. Khadi, S.S. Udikeri and H.M. Vamadevaiah on March 23, 2012 2. In your opinion what is the order of these institutions on the basis of their contribution in the development ofBikaneri Nerma Bt (BN Bt) and 'Bt NHH 44'? 1. NRCPB, New Delhi 2. UAS, Dharwad 3. CICR, Nagpur. 3. What was the seed source ofBN that was used for transformation? - - - - - I. 4. How was the work on the development of 'BN Bt' cotton divided among the three institutions, namely NRCPB, VAS and CICR? a) NRCPB, New Delhi:(Lead centre NATP Project) (i) Providing gene construct for genetic transformation, conducting gene integration studies through PCR and southern and other molecularjmalysis. (iI) Providing required information on gene construct and molecular analysis information to RCGM and GEAC for approval. (iii)Coordination and monitoring the NATP project in terms oftechnical and financial aspect as a lead centre. b) UAS, Dharwad: (Cooperating centre ofNATP Project) (i) Genetic transformation (iI) Screening and advancement of transgenic material based on ELISA and PCR results from CICR, Nagpur and NRCPB, New Delhi. (iiI') Providing transgenic seed material for conduct of RCGM, GEAC, Environmental safety and Biosafety trials (Iv) Seed production and Supply c) CICR, Nagpnr: (Cooperating centre of NATP Project) (i) Time to time conduct ofELISA and PCR tests oftransgenic material. (iI) Conduct ofenvironmental safety studies ofBt cotton; (iii) Facilitating to conduct biosafety studies through outsourcing. (Iv) Making application to RCGM, GEAC and PPV and FR. (v) Procurement, packing and distribution of Bt seeds received from UAS, Dharwad. BN seed material was obtained from CRS, Nanded of MAU, Parabhani for gelletic transformation studies. How can you explain the morphological differences in BN Bt and non-Bt BN as presented in PPV & FR application? The application was made by the Director, CICR, Nagpur and the information is available iu the Directorate, CICR, Nagpur only. - 5.
