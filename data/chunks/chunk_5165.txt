 Score sheet Parameter Intervals of observation 0 Day 7 Day 14 Day 21 Day 30 Day Swelling (scores) Pain (scores) Weight bearing in standing position (scores) Weight bearing in motion (scores) graded as: 0=no swelling; 1=mild swelling; 2=moderate swelling; and 3=severe swelling. Pain: Pain at the site was observed and graded as: 0=no pain; 1=mild pain; 2=moderate pain; and 3=severe pain. Weight bearing in standing position: Weight bearing in standing posture at rest was graded as: 0=no weight bearing; 1=toe touching the ground; 2=moderate weight bearing; and 3=full weight  VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Table 1.

The mean scores of swelling decreased after application of ITK technology at the affected part. The results of pain scores (Fig. 3) show that the mean scores of pain also decreased after application of ITK technology at the affected part. The pain score that was 2.23 on day 0 was reduced to 0.16 on day 30 after treatment. The results after application of ITK on the joints and limb swelling are presented in the Table 3 and Fig. 4. The reduction in mean scores of swelling was observed after application of ITK technology at the affected part. The results of pain scores at different time intervals after treating joints swelling of limbs are presented in Fig. 5. The mean scores of pain were decreased after application of ITK technology at the affected part. The pain score that was 3 on day 0 was reduced to 0.71 on day 30 after treatment. The results of weight bearing scores in standing position at different time intervals after treating joints swelling of limbs are presented in Fig. 6. There was gradual improvement in weight- bearing scores and on day 30 after treatment the mean score was 2.5. The results of weight bearing scores during walking at different time intervals after treating joints swelling of limbs are presented in Fig. 7. There was gradual improvement in weight- bearing scores and on day 30 after treatment the mean score was 3.5. The results of shoulder swelling showed that there was significant decrease in swelling and pain scores at different time intervals after commencement of treatment. It indicates that after treatment there was decrease in pain as well as swelling of the shoulder.
