 Hence, tissue culture protocol has been developed using various explants (shoot tip, cormlet and male flower bud along with suckers of cv. Udhayam). Regular package of practices were adopted and observations on vegetative parameters were recorded 3, 5, and 7 months after planting. The plants derived from different explants showed highly significant differences in plant height, girth, number of leaves, leaf length, width and petiolar length. Crop duration was lowest in male flower buds (373 days), followed by suckers (391 days), shoot tip (406 days) and cormlet (433 days). Similarly, yield was also highest in male flower buds (26.0 kg), followed by sucker (20.30 kg), shoot tip (19.0 kg) and cormlet (18.0 kg). Evaluation of 32 progenies of banana obtained from open-pollinated seeds of natural tetraploid, Bhat Manohar, resulted in identification of promising progeny (progeny No. 667) that performed better in yield and quantitative traits. This recorded a bunch weight of 19.5 kg, which is 90% higher than original Bhat Manohar (10.5 kg). Fruit length (14.5 cm) was 50% Progress under ICAR Seed Project–Seed Production in Agricultural Crops during 2016-17 Guava CISH-G-14 Aonla CISH A-33 Paddy seed production at CIARI, Port Blair Groundnut (Trombay Konkan Tapora) seed production at Dapoli CROP IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 46 more than the normal (9.5cm). This could either be used directly in commercial cultivation or be used in the development of superior triploids. Preliminary evaluation trial in banana conducted with 16 hybrids of Saba × Pisang Lilin cross- combination, revealed that three progenies namely progeny No 684, 685 and 690 recorded an average bunch weight of 22, 42 and 32 kg, respectively over a period of three years. Bunch and fruit characteristics of Progeny No.684 were like Saba (dark green fruits, blunt tip), while progeny No. 685 had green and pointed tip as in Kothia (ABB). Fruit hands of progeny No.690 are loosely packed, matured fruits are green and slightly wax coated. The preliminary sensory analyses suggested that these hybrids are more suitable for culinary purpose. Three exotic varieties of citrus, viz. US Pummelo- 145, Cutter Valencia and Flame grapefruit have been introduced and two varieties have been developed through indigenous material, viz. NRCC Pummelo-5 and NRCC Grapefruit-6. These varieties will fulfil long standing demand of citrus growers of central India for diversification and citrus varieties for processing. In litchi, three new varieties were released. Litchi, Gandaki Sampada, is late-maturing, ripens during mid- June with larger fruit (36.85 g), high pulp recovery (>80%) and yield of 120-140 kg/tree. Gandaki Yogita is late-maturing with dwarf plants. It is tolerant to fruit-borer and fruit cracking and, suitable for high- density planting with an yield potential of 70-80 kg/ tree. Gandaki Lalima is high-yielding (130-140 kg/ tree) with fruit weight of 28-32 g.
