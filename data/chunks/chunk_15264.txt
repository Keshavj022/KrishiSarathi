 We discussed the traditional irrigation method and its modernization for enhancing water use efficiency, PIS monitoring and controlling, architecture, data sharing communication technologies, the role of artificial intelligence for irrigation water-saving, and the future prospects of the PIS. Based on the brief literature review, the present study concluded that the future of PISs seems bright, driven by the need for efficient irrigation water management systems, technological advancements, and increasing environmental awareness. As the water scarcity problem intensifies due to climate change and population growth, the PIS is poised to play a critical role in optimizing and modernizing water usage, increasing water use efficiency, and reducing environmental footprints, thus ensuring sustainable agriculture development.

Introduction Compared to other natural resources (such as soil), water is one of the most critical resources and factors considered for performing agricultural activities. Studies have reported that globally, the agriculture sector utilizes around 70% of available freshwater annually to irrigate only 25% of the arable land [1,2]. Also, water is essential for many other agricultural activities, such as livestock and aquaculture development. Both sectors have significant contributions to the gross domestic product of several countries and are necessary for manufacturing several value-added products; thus, water availability is often a limiting factor in agricultural production [3,4]. He et al. [5] stated that water resources are fundamental natural and strategic economic sources that can retain the sustainable development of agriculture. Climate change further increases water stress issues, making water availability less predictable by changing world weather patterns. Now, the annual temperature and precipitation trends are changing, and several regions are facing unpredictable weather patterns.
