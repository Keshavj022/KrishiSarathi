 Experiment The experiments were conducted at Regional Centre of Central Tuber Crops Research Institute farm and in the farmers’ field during 2002 – 2003 with three treatments , viz. (i) ITK method ( treatment with fresh cowdung slurry) , (ii) recommended practice ( treating with 0.05 % Bavistin and ash or cowdung slurry), and (iii) control (no treatment).The experiment was laid out in randomized block design with 10 replications. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field survey It was found that sprouting was higher when 200 g yam setts were treated with fresh cowdung slurry, followed by recommended (treating with 0.05% Bavistin and ash or cowdung slurry) practice and control methods (Table 1). Efficacy of cowdung slurry was also found to be superior in terms of good field establishment, less disease incidence, obtaining more number of planting materials, ease in operation, low cost, high yield and good taste as compared to treatment with 0.05% Bavistin+ash or cowdung slurry and control practice. Experiment Sprouting of yam setts was determined at Research Station and also under on-farm conditions. The efficacy of indigenous knowledge (treating with fresh cowdung slurry) was compared with the recommended practice (treating with 0.05% Bavistin + ash or cowdung slurry) with a control treatment. Cowdung used contained 0.30–0.45% nitrogen, 0.15–0.25% phosphorus, 0.05–0.15% potassium with 14.6% total organic material and 82–85% moisture. Results obtained are presented in Table 2. It Table 1.

Germination studies using isolated organisms Germination studies were conducted with fresh the experiment, the phenol content of non- germinated tubers and sprouts were studied and results are presented in Table 4. It is indicative that lower phenol content in fresh cowdung might have promoted higher generation in tubers. No definite trend could be seen between germination and phenol content in sprout. Table 2.
