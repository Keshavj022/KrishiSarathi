 As per MoU signed between ICAR-CIRB and the Department of Animal Husbandry, Punjab, quality Nili Ravi semen straws were produced to supply frozen semen in the Nili Ravi tract of Punjab. Buffalo breeding herd analyser: A novel tool “Kalrumpscale” was designed for measuring 3D angular and linear orientation of buffalo external rump/ pelvic surface. Sheep In Muzaffarnagari sheep, the overall least-squares means of body weights of lambs at birth, 3, 6, 9 and 12 month age were 3.40±0.04, 15.13±0.25, 24.93±0.39, 27.22±0.60 and 35.18±0.60 kg, respectively. Male lambs gained higher body weights as compared to female lambs at all growth stages.The average daily gain of Muzaffarnagari lambs during 0-3, 3-6 and 6-12 months were 130.17±3.87, 100.04±3.35 and 63.83±1.93g/day, respectively, under semi-intensive feeding management. Muzaffarnagari Rams selection for better growth and wool production. Presently, there are six cooperating centres with its coordinating unit at ICAR-CSWRI, Avikanagar. Four of these units are farm based units while two are field based units. In Marwari and Deccani sheep, an improvement of 3.94 and 10.48% in six-month body weight was recorded over the last year. Progeny born from quality Magra rams had higher body weight at birth (3.08 vs 2.90 kg), weaning (16.24 vs 14.97 kg), six-month (23.92 vs 22.01 kg) and twelve- month (29.03 vs 27.56 kg) than progeny born from farmers’ ram. In Magra sheep, the average fibre diameter, medullation and staple length were 34.20μ, 35.48 % and 6.34 cm, respectively. In Deccani sheep, average ewes’ age at first service, age at first lambing and ewes’ weight at first lambing were 481.23 days, 630.03 days and 30.77 kg, respectively. Inter-lambing period was 316.71 days. In Muzaffarnagri breed, average weight at first service, age at first service, age at first lambing and ewes weight at lambing ewes were 36.1 kg, 488 days, 649 days and 36.4 kg, respectively, and lambing rate was improved by 3.30% over the last year. Overall flock survivability improved in farm flock and was 98.00% in Marwari, 97.81% in Muzaffarnagri, 92.67% in Deccani and 94.20% in Nellore breed. Mega Sheep Seed Project: The project has two inter-linked components: (i) Development and maintenance of nucleus flocks of the indigenous sheep breeds in the Institutional farm located in the respective breeding tracts, their genetic evaluation, selection and production of superior males, (ii) distribution of superior breeding males and other necessary inputs to the registered farmers and evaluation of progenies of the distributed rams in the field. Oestrous synchronization and artificial insemination with fresh liquid diluted semen are being implemented for faster propagation and wide coverage with semen of superior germplasm. Chhotanagpuri Sheep Unit, BAU, Ranchi: The flock has 668 Chhotanagpuri sheep including 419 breedable females for production of high performing sheep seed.
