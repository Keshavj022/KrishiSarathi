Mail Id: krishnegowda1974@gmail.com Abstract: The Indian economy relies on four major sectors: agriculture, industry, information technology, and others. Among these, the agriculture sector plays a significant role in the economic development of the country. Its contribution to GDP has steadily increased, demonstrating its vital role in supporting the Indian economy. The share of agriculture in national income is often seen as an indicator of a country’s economic development. Developed economies are generally less reliant on agriculture compared to underdeveloped countries. Since globalization, numerous technological advancements have transformed the agriculture sector in India. The government has also implemented various measures to foster its growth and development. Cropping patterns in India are primarily determined by natural factors such as rainfall, climate, and soil conditions, with technology serving as a supporting factor. Additionally, factors including economic, historical, social, and governmental policies influence cropping patterns. This study examines the role of cropping patterns, trends in agricultural production, and key crops in India. Secondary data has been analysed with the help of statistical tools such as tables, ratios, and percentages. Keywords: Agriculture, Cropping Patterns, Trends, Land utilisation, India. *Authors for correspondence: E-mail Id: krishnegowda1974@gmail.com Received:13/12/2024 Accepted:28/12/2024 DOI: https://doi.org/10.53555/AJBR.v27i5S.5737 © 2024 The Author(s).
