 Integrating livestock with crop systems allows for the ef- ficient use of crop residues as animal feed, thereby reduc- ing the need for additional feed production and its associ- ated carbon emissions. Nutrient management Dryland agriculture accounts for 68% of India’s culti- vated land, supporting 40% of the human population and 60% of livestock. It contributes 44% of the country’s food supply, playing a crucial role in India’s food security (Singh et al., 2019). However, irregular monsoon rainfall often leads to droughts, severely affecting resource-poor farmers. The challenges of dryland agriculture, such as degraded soils with low water-holding capacity, nutrient S50 DAS ET AL. [Vol. 69, deficiencies, and declining groundwater levels, result in low crop yields and further land degradation. Carbon foot- print analysis of major crop groups reveals that pulse crops have the lowest emission rates (16%), followed by cereals (25%), commercial crops (29%), and oilseeds (30%) (Devakumar et al., 2018). Pulses, being legumi- nous, fix atmospheric nitrogen, reducing the need for chemical nitrogen fertilizers (Kakraliya et al., 2018). Al- though blending legumes with cereals is a traditional prac- tice, it needs renewed emphasis for its environmental ben- efits in the face of climate change. Between the two crop- ping seasons, the Kharif season has a higher carbon foot- print than Rabi due to the larger area and number of crops grown, including both irrigated and rainfed crops (Singh et al., 2022). The Kharif season is predominant as it coin- cides with the south-west monsoon, while Rabi crops are limited to irrigated regions. Irrigated agriculture requires more inputs than rainfed farming, with energy for irriga- tion being a significant contributor to emissions. Addition- ally, the small landholdings typical of rainfed agriculture enable manual farming operations, resulting in lower emission rates in semiarid regions, which warrants due recognition. In dryland semiarid regions, major crops such as jowar, bajra, ragi, maize, wheat, Bengal gram, red gram, soybean, groundnut, and cotton exhibit varying carbon footprints of approximately 0.09, 0.01, 0.06, 0.06, 0.009, 0.02, 0.04, 0.04, 0.03, and 0.04 Tg CE per year, respectively (Devakumar et al., 2018). The carbon emissions per kilo- gram of grain product are 0.80 kg CO2e for canola (Bras- sica napus L.), 0.59 for mustard (Brassica juncea L.) and flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.), 0.46 for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and 0.20 to 0.33 kg CO2e for chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), dry pea (Pisum sativum L.), and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.). Notably, durum wheat following an N-fixing crop (i.e., pulses) emits 673 kg CO2e, 20% lower than when following a cereal crop. Similarly, durum wheat after an oilseed emits 744 kg CO2e, an 11% reduction compared to after a cereal. The carbon footprint for durum grown after a pulse is 0.25 kg CO2e per kg of grain, and 0.
