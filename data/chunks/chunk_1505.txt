 This leads to improved water and nutrient-use efficiency when compared to the conventional cereal crop which possess C3 pathway. Reduced crop failure risk: By including the millets to diversify the crop, farmers can reduce their dependence on a single crop. If the primary crop of the farmer fails due to a pest infestation, diseases or adverse weather conditions, millets can provide a best alternative source of income. Adaptability to climate variability: Millets have a shorter life cycle than rice and wheat, which helps to reduce stress. Plants with low stature, small leaf area, thicker cell walls, and deep root systems are more resistant to stress. Also, a shorter cycle means reduced exposure to prolonged dry spells. Millets benefit from the C4 photosynthetic feature, which helps them survive even under low CO2 concentration (8-10 ppm). Millets have the potential to adapt to shifting climates, making them a promising next-generation crop. Lower inputs and market diversification: Millets often require less inputs like fertilizers and pesticides, when compared to other food grain crops. This reduces the dependency on costly inputs which has less financial risk. Also, at present, most people are choosing millets in their day-to-day diet as they are nutritionally rich and possess other major health benefits. So, with consumer demand, millets offer new opportunities in the market. By diversifying into millets, farmers can emerge their crop into new markets to reduce financial risk associated with the traditional crops like rice and wheat. Promote biodiversity: Millets enhances the biodiversity in the agricultural systems, promoting a healthier ecosystem. Different millets support diverse habitats for insects, birds, and other wildlife, contributing to a more balanced ecosystem. A diversified ecosystem reduces the diseases and pests naturally, further reducing risks associated with crop production, particularly in rainfed agriculture. SUMMARY Millets, belonging to the Poaceae family, are ideal crops for rainfed agriculture and for climate change conditions, outperforming traditional cereals like rice and wheat. They are extensively grown in diverse soil and climatic conditions. They excel in rainfed areas due to their drought tolerance and pest resistance. Economically, millets are minimal maintenance compared to conventional crops, reducing risks under unpredictable rainfall. They thrive in low rainfall and elevated temperatures, thanks to their unique physiological traits. Even if grain production is low, millets can serve as fodder for livestock. With rising awareness of their dietary benefits, demand for millets is increasing, making them a valuable choice for rainfed farming where conventional crops are riskier. *Corresponding author email: pc.sorghummillets@icar.gov.
