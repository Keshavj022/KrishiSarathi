 As a result, the cost of farming also increased, making the MSP and input subsidies (to fertilisers, water, and electricity) necessary to make it a viable venture for farmers. This means, even from an economic angle, the practice of Rice-Wheat-System (RWS) in states like Punjab and Haryana has become unsus- tainable in the long run. For instance, according to the envi- ronmental statistics provided by the Punjab government, Fig. 3 The current incentive structure for Rice and Wheat crops in Punjab and Haryana Source: Created by authors 29 https://www.deccanherald.com/business/union-budget/sub sidy-bill-shoots-up-in-2023-24-to-rs-562-lakh-crore-1186847.html 30 https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200803-the-solar- canals-revolutionising-indias-renewable-energy 31 https://www.livemint.com/news/india/the-waiting-game-pallas sana-farmers-in-kerala-struggle-with-the-capricious-nature-of-the- monsoon-and-ﬁnancial-burdens-11686850957612.html  Accessed on 22 July 2023. 32 Fertiliser use in India has increased from 5515.6 thousand tonnes in 19801981 to 28,122.2 thousand tonnes in 20102011 and they were overused at a ratio of 8.2:3.2:1 as against a recommended dose of 4:2:1 (Singla & Kaur, 2015). Transformative policies for a sustainable future 27 nearly 40% of land in Punjab has deteriorated due to RWS and intensive use of fertilisers33. In addition, the agrochemicals seeped into water bodies in and around the farmlands, polluting the drinking water and increasing disease incidence. Further, the increased usage of fertilisers is reducing the nutritional content of the food. Therefore, from a social sustainability angle too, the current chemical-based, water-intensive agricultural practi- ces are causing severe harm. In addition, the electricity used for pumping water from the ever-receding water table and the chemicals used in fertilisers, pesticides and insecti- cides create signiﬁcant carbon footprint and hazardous emissions that are harmful to both people and the planet. On the whole, the manner in which subsidies are provided for various inputs such as fertilisers, water and electricity encourages wrong practices by farmers. Ineffective imple- mentation of regulations on input quality further exacer- bates this situation. Poor extension service has also been a major factor in limiting sustainability-related awareness creation and adoption of sustainable agricultural practices in the country. Further, the short time-duration between crops and the enormous volumes of crop residue left behind by the HYV crops is forcing the farmers in states that follow RWS, such as Punjab, Haryana and Utter Pradesh, to resort to crop resi- due burning (CRB) every winter. This contributes to massive pollution not just in the Delhi NCR region but across Indo- Gangetic plains (Ghosh et al., 2019). Delhi had a death toll of approximately 57,000 in 2020 due to air pollution, which also caused a ﬁnancial loss of US$8.
