 The disease causes high economic losses in the country, as the infection rate in goat and sheep may reach up to 80-90%. The range of expected economic losses due to PPR was estimated to be between Rs. 4571 and Rs. 4683 crore/annum (Bardhan et al. 2017). By the years 2001 and 2002, the technologies with proven efficacy for vaccine and mAb-based diagnostic kits for antigen and antibody detection were developed. The PPRV/Sungri/96 strain (Sreenivasa et al. 2000) is a vaccine virus strain used in India under mass PPR vaccination campaigns. This vaccine virus has been characterized extensively at antigenic and genomic levels (Singh and Bandyopadhayay 2015). The long-term immunity study indicated that the vaccine induces and maintains optimum virus-neutralizing antibodies for a long duration. Therefore, a single dose is sufficient for Indian Agriculture after Independence 244 the protection of small ruminants. Large scale application of this vaccine to control the disease in India has been largely possible due to the Government of India’s supported PPR control programme and transfer of technology by ICAR to commercial manufacturers in the public and private sectors. The monoclonal antibody-based diagnostic kits namely sandwich-ELISA and competitive-ELISA have been used for diagnosis within the country for the last 20 years. The country is now self-sufficient in requirement of PPR vaccine and conventional/molecular diagnostics technologies including the recombinant antigen- based competitive ELISA kit (Balamurugan et al. 2021a), which may help during disease eradication programme. The trend of disease outbreak reduction during the last 15 years since the vaccines and diagnostics became available is shown in the maps below (Balamurugan et al. 2021b): Fig. 4. District-wise outbreaks of Peste des Petits Ruminants over the years District-wise cumulative outbreaks of PPR are considered one of the most important health constraints in rearing small ruminants. Various components of losses due to PPR in sheep and goats are mortality losses, reproductive failure, increased abortions, body weight loss, and treatment costs (Govindaraj et al. 2016). In addition, wool loss, increased inter-lambing Achievements in Animal Health Management in Independent India 245 period in case of sheep and milk loss and increased inter-kidding period in case of goats are other important losses (Bardhan et al. 2017). The benefit-cost of ‘Mass Vaccination Campaign’ in Chhattisgarh state reported benefit: cost ratio, net present value, and internal rate of return of 4.9:1, Rs. 342 crores and 146.6% under low incidence scenario; 12.4:1, Rs. 998 crores and 430.4% under medium incidence scenario and 13.5:1, Rs. 1096 crore and 430.4% under high incidence scenario respectively (Govindaraj et al. 2019).
