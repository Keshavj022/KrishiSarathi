 Model calibration, validation, and effectiveness From the areal changing matrix, it is found that there is about +4.998 per cent variation for Zone I from the FCOPRAS to AHP, whereas it is −0.215 per cent for Zone III and −2.860 per cent for Zone V. The ROC and accuracy estimation indicate that the FCOPRAS is more valid and accurate than the AHP, with 91.9 percent and 84.31 percent, respectively. Another hand, it is found that there is about +1.021 per cent areal variation for Zone I from the FCOPRAS to Random Forest, whereas it is +3.781 per cent for Zone III and-0.742 per cent for Zone V. The ROC estimation indicates that Random Forest has higher validity and accuracy, with 92.0 percent and 85.88 percent. On the other hand, about −3.68 per cent areal variation of Zone I from FCOPRAS to Multilayer Perceptron, whereas it is-2.11 per cent for Zone III and +5.85 per cent for Zone V. The ROC estimation indicates FCOPRAS has 0.20 per cent higher validity than Multilayer Perceptron. The areal changing matrix indicates that there is about −3.98 per cent areal variation in Zone I from the AHP to Random Forest technique, whereas it is +3.10 per cent for Zone III and +2.12 per cent for Zone V. The ROC estimation indicates that the validity of the Random Forest is 92.0 per cent which is very much satisfying condition of the result (Table 7). From the areal changing matrix, it is found that there is about +11.98 per cent areal variation for Zone I from the AHP to Multilayer Perceptron where it is −1.15 per cent for Zone II, 16.42 per cent for Zone III, and +7.08 per cent for Zone V. The ROC and accuracy estimation indicate that the MLP has higher validity and accuracy, with 91.7 per cent and 78.72 per cent, respectively. From the comparison between RF and MLP, it is found that about +7.93 per cent areal variation in Zone I, whereas it is −5.07 per cent for Zone II and +9.21 per cent for Zone V. The ROC estimation indicates that Random Forest (Shi et al., 2021) has higher acceptance than MLP (Thach et al., 2018) with 92.0 per cent and 91.7 per cent respectively. The ROC for AHP is 0.894 (89.4%), for FCOPRAS is 0.919 (91.9%), for Random Forest is 0.920 (92.0%), for Multi-layer Perceptron is 0.917 (91.7%) whereas the Accuracy values for above mentioned techniques are 78.72%, 84.31%, 85.88%, and 83.33% respectively. In both ways, the accuracies of Random forest, and FCOPRAS has higher acceptance than other methods (Fig. 5). From the overall ROC estimation, it is found that the Random Forest method is more proficient and effective to measure site suitability, fol­ lowed by FCOPRAS though the ROC of applied techniques is above 90%. In the Second technique, the validity and accuracy of the Random Forest are higher than in other techniques. 7. Novelty and major findings of the study • In this study, the AHP pair-wise comparison matrix is used in FCOPRAS for the estimation of the variable’s weight.
