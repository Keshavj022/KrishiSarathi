2 kg of fish and shrimp was harvested ● A breakthrough has been achieved in the seed production and larval rearing of sea cucumber, Holothuria spinifera for the first time in the hatchery ● A major breakthrough in successful domestication of the tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon has been achieved ● Six new designs for eco-friendly and resource specific demersal trawls were developed ● A few peptides from the salivary gland secretions of the cone, Conus inscriptus were detected. These peptides have biomedical importance since they are potent analgesic agents ● Genetic characterisation of Labeo species, viz rohu, calbasu, bata, fimbriatus, gonius and diochelius was done using RAPD-PCR profiling ● With the aim to preserve natural genetic variability, sperms of wild stocks of prioritized fish species Catla catla, Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigala and Labeo dussumieri were cryopreserved DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 126 Ecological features of high altitude lakes Parameters Deoriatal Gandhisarovar Daityatal Vasukital Hemkund Sahib Location altitude (masl) 3255.00 3970.00 4275.00 4300.00 4329.00 Water temp.

It revealed higher HAI (61.5) in polluted site compared to non-polluted site (26.5) in fish R. rita. COLDWATER SECTOR Environmental Status of Nainital Lake (Uttaranchal) The winter fish kill in Nainital lake is very common. Therefore investigation was conducted to know the reason. It was observed that due to intense nutrient loading the oxygen cycle has been adversely affected in the lake. The presence of toxic substances like ammonia and hydrogen sulphide was recorded at bottom. In Nainital lake, the fishes are facing acute stress condition due to low oxygen level at surface as well as bottom of the lake. Survey of High Mountain Lakes in Central Himalayan Region A survey was conducted in high altitude lakes of the Central Himalayan region of Garhwal to evaluate their ecological features, biodiversity and fisheries. Most of these lakes have religious sanctity and serve as biodiversity sanctuaries. The survey has revealed that these coldwater lakes are oligotrophic in nature. CULTURE FISHERIES FRESHWATER AQUACULTURE Spawning of Asian Catfish, Clarias batrachus A breakthrough has been achieved in spawning Asian catfish, Clarias batrachus spontaneously. With the manipulation of hormone dose, latency period and brood stock feed, the fishes breed without stripping male and female and spawn spontaneously following hormone injection.
