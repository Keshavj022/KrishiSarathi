 About 30-35 days old seedlings are transplanted when they attain 12-15 cm height and have 3-4 leaves. Once the seedlings are uprooted, they are first soaked for 15 minutes in Captan solution (2 g/l) and then transplanted in the field. About 25-30 tonnes FYM, 50-55 kg urea, 325-350 kg SSP and 75-100 kg MOP/ha should be mixed in the soil during field preparation as basal dose. The seedlings are planted in ridges and furrows at a spacing of 75 cm (row to row) × 60 cm (plant to plant) during the kharif season. Nitrogen in the form of urea @ 50 kg each is applied two times, once after one month of transplanting and again 3-4 weeks later. Irrigation should be given at 10-15 days interval or depending upon the weather condition. Plant protection The main pests of brinjal are fruit and shoot borer, jassids, epilachna beetle and mites. Fruit and shoot borer occur throughout the crop growing season however, jassids and epilachna beetle cause more damage during the vegetative growth. The major damage to the crop is caused by fruit and shoot borer which is the most damaging pest of brinjal. This pest can be managed by setting up pheromone traps at 10-12/ha or by cutting and removing the infested shoots, i.e half inch below the bore point and burying them deep into the soil. However, the lure of the trap should be changed regularly at an interval of 15-20 days. Spraying with Spinosad @ 4.5 ml/10 litre of water before flowering or at fortnightly interval will help in managing the pest. The main diseases are Fusarium wilt, little leaf and Phomopsis blight. The crop is also being attacked by a complex virus and the only way to manage is to uproot the infested plants and bury deep in the soil to avoid further spread.
