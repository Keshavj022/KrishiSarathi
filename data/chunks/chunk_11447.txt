5 kg urea, 250 kg SSP, 67 Kg MOP ha-1 as basal. Then top- dress urea in two splits viz. 87 kg at branching stage and 43.5 kg at flowering stage. Apply at least two irrigations at branching and flowering stages. In sulphur-deficient soil, apply 45 kg sulphur ha-1. Summer Greengram: Short duration yellow mosaic virus resistant greengram variety like IPM-02-14 or IPM-205-7 may be grown to obtain maximum yield and return Seed should be inoculated with Rhizobium, PSB & KSB @ 1.5 kg /haeachbefore sowing to get more yield as well reduce the use of chemical fertilizers ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 208 Two-time spray with micro nutrient (Mo) @ 0.5 g/lit of water during flowering stage at 15 days interval Sunflower: The variety LFSH-171, KBSH-53 & 78 of sunflower may be grown during rabi-summer season with 3-4 irrigation During field preparation, the organic manure like decomposed cowdung/FYM @ 7-8 t/ha or 2.0 t/ha vermicompost should be used to improve soil health and crop productivity Chemical fertilizers @ 90:90:40 kg NPK/ha is to be used Two-time spray with micro nutrient (B) @ 2 g/lit. of water during square formation and flowering stage should be used for better seed set and maximum yield Cotton: Hirsutum cotton may be grown during rabiâ€“summer season in non-saline as well as saline soil of Sundarbans in rice- fallow by providing 2-3 irrigations The seed should be treated with fungicide and germinated seeds should be sown directly in a field after land preparation with a spacing of 45cm X 30 cm The sowing of cotton is to be done within 15th of Dec. to 15th of Jan. Chemical fertilizers @ 80:40:30 kg NPK/ha is to be used One-time thinning operation followed by earthing up is to be done within 30-40 DAS Use Indoxacarb 14.5% SC @ 360 ml/ha or Rynaxypyr 18.5 % SC @ 150 ml/ha two times at 15 days interval to control spotted boll worm and Helicoverpa during boll development stage After harvesting the seed cotton, proper sun drying should be done before bagging ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 209 Lathyrus: Area under pulse may be increased by growing of lathyrus as paira crop The sowing of lathyrusshould be done in the month of Nov. in moist soil when the rice is in flowering stage. 45-50 kg/ha seed is required for sowing. Ratan, B-1, Pusa-24, Prateek, Maha Teora etc. varieties may be grown for better yield Two to three times spray with 2% urea are to be done during growth and flowering stage for better yield Use Indoxacarb 14.5% SC @ 360 ml/ha or Rynaxypyr 18.5 % SC @ 150 ml/ha two times at 15 days interval to control pod borer Horticultural Crops Vegetables: For the coming rabi season, the better vegetable crop choice would be tomato, chilli, bitter gourd, French bean and Dolichos bean for the land embankment system. For upland situation, cabbage, cauliflower, knolkhol, brinjal, beet, carrot and radish are suggested.
