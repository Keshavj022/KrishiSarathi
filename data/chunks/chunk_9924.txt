 It covered >10 ha, beating all records for a single variety or hybrid of any crop to cover such a large area. IARI basmati rice varieties occupy about 98% of the Basmati area of the Country. The annual economic surplus generated from PB1121 is estimated at ` 14,707 crores during triennium ending 2018- 2019. The earnings from PB 1121 are about 96% of the total expenditure of the entire NARES (`15,379 crores) during TE 2018-19.

In fruits, IARI’s Amrapali Mango variety, released in 1979, is vary popular export quality variety and is being commercially grown in more than 2,00,000 ha in India. Several vegetable varieties developed by IARI have contributed to enhance the vegetable production and bringing nutritional security of India. In 1990s, United States Environmental Protection Agency blamed by showing that paddy cultivation by India leads to emission of 37.8 Tg CH4yr–1 methane. IARI played a major role in combating this claim and showed that the methane emission from Indian paddies is as low as 4.0 Tg yr−1. This helped India to protect its rice cultivation and thus food security. IARI continues to provide inputs to IPCC and actively participates in preparation of IPCC reports. IARI’s Neem coated urea technology is fully adapted by fertilizer industry in India (Govrnment vide notification dated 25 May 2015) and from 1st September 2015, 100% urea produced is neem coated urea. IARI Neem-coated urea technology saves 5 kg urea for each bag of Urea sold in the Country every year. The Institute has developed several technologies for natural resource management, water management, pest control, microbial biofertilizers, novel plant protection chemical, etc., that contributed to enhanced productivity and environmental sustainability. The institute is well known for its pioneer work on remote sensing applications in agriculture since 1970’s starting with coconut wilt disease detection till date. IARIhas significantly contributed in developing protocols and technologies through basic and strategic research on remote sensing. The extension and economic policy research have contributed immensely in the Nation’s agricultural extension and economic policies. IARI, the Seat of Higher Learning in Agriculture Agriculture education in IARI was started in 1923 with two years Post Graduate Diploma, associates of IARI, equivalent to the M Sc degree. The Institute was granted with the status of a Deemed University in 1958 under UGC Act 1956. The Post Graduate School of IARI was inaugurated on 6 October 1958. This led to the start of M Sc and PhD degree programs in agriculture.
