 Its laying capacity is around 170-190 eggs per annum. Poultry/Duck Improved poultry varieties for sustainable poultry production: To achieve climate resilient poultry farming goal, three climate resilient dual type hardy birds for efficient egg and meat production were developed. This will help in increasing farmer’s income by maximizing production throughout the year without compromising bird’s welfare.

The skin, beak, shank, toes and soles are dark gray colour with muscle and most internal organs having black pigmentation due to deposition of melanin pigment. Its laying capacity is about 170- 195 eggs per annum. Rural poultry: The six-weeks shank length and body weight (851.0±3.15g) in PD-1 line (Vanaraja male line) increased significantly compared to last generation. The genetic and phenotypic response in shank length at 6 weeks of age was 0.83 and 0.72 mm per generation over the last 15 generations. In PD-6 line (Gramapriya male line), the egg production up to 40 weeks was 64.57±020 eggs with an egg weight of 55.53±0.02 g. In PD-2 line (Vanaraja female line), the egg production and egg weight at 52 weeks were 130.6±0.98 and 55.88±0.04, respectively. In S-18 generation, the body weight and shank length at 6 weeks of age were 701.7±4.98 g and 77.32±0.001 mm, respectively. In the PD-3 line (Gramapriya female line), the egg mass at 40 and 64 weeks of age was 5547±1.74 and 12369±4.06 g, respectively, which increased significantly from the last generation. The genetic and phenotypic response for egg mass at 40 weeks was 611 and 739 g, respectively over the last 9 generations. Feed supplement to replace antibiotic growth promoter and reduce thermal stress • CARI–HERBIGROW: Antibiotic growth promo- ters, used in poultry feed are major concern for growing antibiotic resistance. To overcome this problem, CARI- HERBIGROW, a natural product was developed by ICAR-CARI using various herbs which has property of antioxidants, is an immune enhancer, stress reducer and helps chicken to improve overall production. The product was released by Secretary DARE and DG, ICAR on October 29, 2022. • CARI – HERBISTRESSMIN: It is a phytogenic feed additive developed by CARI to reduce effect of heat stress as well as to improve immunity of birds during hot and hot- humid summer. The formulation contains phyto-constituents like polyphenols, beta- carotene, limonene, flavonoid Vitamin C, Vitamin A, folate, calcium, magnesium and potassium.
