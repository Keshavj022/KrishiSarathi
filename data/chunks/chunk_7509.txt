 As SEAI has a very good relationship with SYI-S and SYI-W, hence, the former strongly influence the later. This clarified SEAI is a good indicator of sustainability. Crop protection Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of blast R genes in rice: Sixty rice genotypes were evaluated for leaf and neck blast diseases under Uniform Blast Nursery (UBN) system. Four genotypes (VL 8654, A 57, GSR-125 and GSR-142) for leaf and five genotypes (VL 31817, VL 31851, VL 31916, VL 31997 and GSR-132) for neck blast were highly resistant, with 1 disease score on 0–9 scale. None of the entry showed highly susceptible reaction with 8 and 9 disease score against both the leaf and neck blast disease. For molecular screening, these rice entries were genotyped for the presence of 13 blast resistance genes. A total of 18 markers available for these genes were used for molecular screening. The frequency of positive alleles of R gene ranged from 11 to 16 in the rice entries. Based on the field resistance score against leaf blast, entry VL 8567 showed maximum resistance with 16 numbers of positive alleles followed by Tetep with 13 numbers of positive alleles. For neck blast resistance, entry VL 8654 showed maximum resistance with 16 numbers of positive alleles followed by VL 31851 with 14 numbers of positive alleles. The characterization of 60 rice germplasm using 18 molecular markers linked to 13 major blast resistance R genes revealed that the markers corresponded to four major R genes, viz. Piz, Pi9, Pi2 and Pita/Pita2 were found significantly associated with blast disease resistance. The identified resistance sources can be deployed for effective management of blast disease Species distribution and effective management of whiteflies: Survey was carried out in 26 locations comprising 3 states (Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Tripura) and 1 union territory (Delhi) to collect whitefly samples from both protected and open field conditions. Based on the morphological characters, two major whitefly species, viz. greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) and cotton whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) were found distributed in the locations infecting 11 host plants. Trialeurodes vaporariorum was widely distributed in cold and temperate climates, whereas, Bemisia tabaci was distributed in hot and humid climates. Amongst the tested insecticides, the field populations of greenhouse whitefly was highly susceptible to Thiomethaxam > Imidacloprid > Pymetrozine with LC50 values 12.30, 18.62 and 22.38 ppm, respectively. Whereas, LC50 values of botanical insecticides neam seed kernel extract and nimbicidine were very high; 524.81 ppm and 4,365.16 ppm respectively, indicating their non-suitability for greenhouse whitefly management. Moreover, an entomopathogenic fungus, Alternaria alternata strain Whiteflies infecting French bean VLH1 found infecting greenhouse whiteflies on Salvia divinorum plants in ICAR-VPKAS, Experimental farm, Hawalbag (29.63°N and 79.63°E, 1250 amsl).
