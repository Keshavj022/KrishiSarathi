 The climate of the East Central Assam comprising Darrang, Sonitpur, Morigaon and Nagaon is characterized by the absence of a dry hot summer season, the highest temperature being experienced during the period of south west monsoon along with abundant rains and a humid atmosphere throughout the year. The climate of the Eastern Assam districts (Golaghat, Jorhat, Sibsagar, Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Dhemaji and Lakhimpur) is somewhat identical to Darrang and Nagaon. The tropic of Cancer, passes through the southernmost tip of Mizoram and as such, Assam falls within the sub-tropical zone; but having been dominated by tropical air masses, the area shows characteristics of both sub tropical humid zone and tropical climate which is required for cocoa cultivation. Cocoa technologies available y Cocoa varieties identified for the region for profitable production. y Nursery techniques standardized for quality planting material production. y Planting systems under palm based cropping systems and agro-forestry models are available. y Recommended fertilizer schedule of 100: 40: 40 g NPK/ tree/ year and drip irrigation of 20 litres/ tree during rainless periods are successfully followed. y Canopy architecture methods demonstrated in seedlings and grafted plants under different cropping system models. y Crop cycle was studied and calendar of operations was demonstrated and recommended. y Farm wastes, cocoa leaves, prunings, pod husk and bean shell can be successfully composted and recycled to the garden. y Plant protection measures and biocontrol methods are available for major disease like black pod rot and pests, tea mosquito bug and mealy bugs etc. Cocoa gardens of Assam are so far reported with less squirrel damage. y Mini processing unit (Bean to Bar chocolate making unit) is established at ICAR-CPCRI RC Kahikuchi centre which will serve as Agri Business Incubation Centre as well. y Home/ farm level processing methods available with mini fermentation boxes, baskets and plastic tray to encourage dry bean sale to get more income. y Regular training programs on cocoa from production to processing are being conducted at all ICAR-CPCRI Table 2.
