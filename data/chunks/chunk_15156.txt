The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of five distinct ML models for a dataset sourced from the Kaggle repository to generate practical recommendations for crop selection or determination of required nutrient(s) in a given site. The datasets contain information on NPK, soil pH, and three climatic variables: temperature, rainfall, and humidity. The models namely Support vector machine, XGBoost, Random forest, KNN, and Decision Tree were trained using yields of individual data sets of 11 agricultural and 10 horti­ cultural crops, as well as combined yield of both agri-horticultural crops. The results strongly suggest to evaluate individual data sets separately for each crop category rather than using combined the data sets of both categories for better predictions. Comparing the five ML models, the XGBoost demonstrated the highest level of accuracy.
