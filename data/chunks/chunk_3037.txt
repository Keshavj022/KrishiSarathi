 • Paddy Straw Mushroom (Volvariella volvacea): Based on 2005 and 2006, the mean five strains viz; VV1,VV 4, VV‐6, VV‐7 and OE 112 of paddy straw mushroom (Volvariella volvacea) were tested during April – May,2005 and 2006 The data revealed that the strain VV7,VV6 and OE112 were performing better than other strains which resulted in biological efficiency (BE) of 13.88%,11.29% and 8.06 %, respectively which indicated these strain can be cultivated successfully in summer and monsoon months. • Strain evaluation of Milky mushroom (Calocybe indica): Based on 2005 and 2006, the mean BE of milky mushroom was 84.5%. The maximum BE was found in strain CI‐6 (107%) followed by CI‐ 7 (88.9%), CI‐1 (80.2%), CI‐3 (73.8%) and APK2 (72.8%). All strains performed better than others strains. However, the strain CI‐6 and CI‐7 were at par but significantly superior than other strains. Thus CI‐6, CI‐7 and APK‐2 were better suited strains in respect to fruit quality and yield for cultivation of milky mushroom (Calocybe indica) in Jharkhand in summer months. Among them CI 6 was the best one. Germplasm Collection: The survey was done in the monsoon season of 2003 and 2004. The following fleshy fungi were collected and wet preserved.

The 500 farmers are growing oyster mushroom in the state. Various training programmes were conducted by various organizations to popularize mushroom cultivation in the State. Holy Cross Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Hazaribagh conducted training and trained a total of 2448 number of farmers in Bihar (Anonymous, 2001‐02 to 2004‐05). After creation of Jharkhand in 2000 several other organizations have also trained the farmers. It has been reported by SAMETI (2004) that ATMA, Palamau trained several various tribal women and organized them in 10 groups. A number of farmers were trained by HARP (1860), SRI (152) (Anonymous, 2003‐04) and RK Mission (357) (Anonymous, 2005). A mushroom Divas was organized by HARP on 24th Oct. 2003 to popularize mushroom cultivation in Jharkhand in which various interested mushroom growers participants. ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Barapani (Meghalaya) White Button Mushroom (Agaricus bisporus): High yielding strain CM‐14 of Agaricus bisporus was identified. Chemical pasteurization of long method compost with DDVP + Formalin gave excellent results with respect to button mushroom yield and diseases management. Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus spp.
