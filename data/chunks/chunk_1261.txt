 • By using bio-capsules, the avoided quantity of plant protection chemicals is estimated to be 75.6 Novelty of biocapsule technology. Enhanced product shelf life (18-24 months) Very high microbial counts (10 12) Easy handling and transport No harmful by-products Less requirement of inorganic and inert material Storage at normal temperature Easy application Indian Farming January 2020 48 tonnes (Metalaxyl mancozeb formulation) in spice crops alone. The technology also reduced need for consumption of chemical fertilizers to the tune of 3169 tonnes of inorganic NPK nutrients in spices. The avoided environmental cost from avoided use of fungicide and chemical fertilizers is not explicitly considered herein. • The novel encapsulation technology has been non-exclusively licensed to firms for production of encapsulated microorganisms (biocapsules) or use in crop production.
