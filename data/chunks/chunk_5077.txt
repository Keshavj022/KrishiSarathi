 Experiment Soaking tomato seeds in fresh buttermilk has improved percent germination to the extent of 20 and 11% in varieties Arka vikas and Arka alok  Fig. 1. Relative performance on different treatments Fig. 2. Relative performance of different treatments on yield Significant: Dry vs DW; Dry vs BM; DW vs BM; DRY- Control; DW-Distilled water soaked; BM-Buttermilk soaked Fig. 3.

However, no significant effect of fresh buttermilk in case of brinjal was noticed (Table1). 20% higher seed germination in arka lohit and pusa jwala, respectively. Similar beneficial effect was also noticed in these crops by using 3 day Table 1.

Except in brinjal variety Arka naveenth, the percent in both the varieties tested higher. (Fig 5 and Fig.6) compared to control. Soaking in fresh buttermilk resulted in 15 and Table 2.
