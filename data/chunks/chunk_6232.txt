 The average recovery period in this group was 2 days with 100% efficacy. The results indicated that use of pojo bark alone was effective in non-parasitic diarrhoea and it improved the efficacy of specific anthelmintic Panacure in parasitic diarrhoea. The clinical efficacy at CIRG was assessed on the basis of revival of appetite, fecal consistency, dehydration status, which was categorized on Table 2.

Table 1. Clinical recovery in goats of different groups at BAU Contents VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY scoring basis and changes in serum biochemical parameters. The result of therapeutic efficacy suggested that drug in the given concentration was very effective in bacteria origin diarrhea in goats (Table 2 and 3). Overall efficacy was 73.3 %. Marginal increment was observed in serum glucose, sodium and potassium levels in post treatment. Drug was considered to be safe, as there were no untoward reactions during treatment No significant changes were noted in biochemical parameters viz, total protein, albumin, globulin, AST, and creatinine, supporting the safety of the ITK. Chemical analysis Yield (%), physical characteristic and qualitative analysis revealed the presence of glycosides, alkaloids, saponins and carbohydrate (Tables 3 and 4). Table 3.
