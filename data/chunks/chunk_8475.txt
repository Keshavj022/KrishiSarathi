 International rice genome sequencing consortium shares different chromosomes of rice. (Country flag shown on each rice chromosome represents its share of sequencing) DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 16 first instar larvae of Spodoptera litura (tobacco caterpillar) have revealed significant in planta insecticidal activity of VIP. Biochemical and physiological analyses of the second generation of osmotin potato plants in greenhouse under controlled water supply have been done. In the last crop season, third generation tubers (T3) from the previous year were sown in 65 pots (single tuber per pot) in the greenhouse to collect maximum number of tubers for subsequent field trial. All plants were screened by PCR for transgene expression and were found positive. The PCR amplified products have been further visualized and confirmed by the hybridization with digoxygenin labelled nptII primers in the Southern blots. A transformation protocol of Vigna radiata (mungbean) cv Pusa Vishal and Pusa 9072 for transfer of cowpea protease inhibitor gene has been standardized. FOOD CROPS RICE Crop Improvement In rice, 21 varieties and one hybrid have been released.
