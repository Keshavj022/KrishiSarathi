 Health and nutrition (152 technologies assessed through 1,353 trials at 314 locations) and value-addition (96 technologies, 911 trials at 339 locations) were the major thematic areas of technologies assessed with an aim to promote women empowerment. Frontline Demonstrations Cluster Frontline Demonstration A detailed programme was planned, prepared and executed by Division of Agriculture Extension, ICAR, New Delhi on Cluster Frontline Demonstrations (CFLDs) under NFSM, Ministry of Agriculture and icar annual report 2022-23 184 Farmers Welfare, GOI, New Delhi with an objective to demonstrate the production potential of major pulses (chickpea, pigeon pea, lentil, blackgram and green- gram) and oilseed (sesame, groundnut, linseed, soybean, mustard, sunflower) crops in pulse and oilseed growing states, viz. Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Cluster Frontline Demonstration on Pulses: During the period under report, 17,973.95 ha area was covered under 48,473 demonstrations on pulse crops across the country. In kharif, 7,623 ha area (20,594 demonstrations) was covered, while in rabi season 8,341.44 ha area (22,822 demonstrations) and in summer season 2,009.39 ha (5,057 demonstrations) was covered. On national level, the average yield advantage in major pulse crops was recorded as 37.42% however, it was highest in Greengram (46.35 %) followed by Blackgram (44.00%), Rajmash (43.49), Horsegram (41.93), Fieldpea (38.70), Lathyrus (34.95), Chickpea (33.25), Lentil (33.03), Pigeonpea (32.05), Mothbean (27.19). This was mainly due to farmers’ awareness, suitable technology interventions and skill developed among farmers by the KVKs.

After completing post-graduation in the year 2014, he started lookingafter his family farms, and realized that… only growing traditional crops like maize, wheat, mustard, gram and groundnut is not profitable; and hence, some innovative enterprise is necessary for enhancement of income.
