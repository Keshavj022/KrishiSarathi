 The study was conducted at Benakunda village covering 10 farmers, who use dry chillies for storage of blackgram and greengram. The parameters studied focused on easy availability, ease to use, effectiveness, safety and cost effectiveness, longevity of storage, seed quality and cooking quality. Experiment An experiment was conducted using four treatments: (i) mixed with dry chillies, (ii) chemical treatment, (iii) treatment with mustard oil and (iv) no treatment (control).

Metal bin and earthen pot were used for storage. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field survey Summer pulses are grown extensively in the region. The productivity of greengram varies between 13 and 15 q. After harvesting, the grains are dried properly and stored both for seed and dal purposes. The major storage pest in greengram is borer (Callosobruchus chinensis). The infestation starts from the field and intensified in the storage. Sometimes it results in total loss of seed. Use of chemicals in the form of fumigants is recommended for reducing the infestation. The ITK (dry chilli) the farmers are using for long as traditional method for storage of pulse seeds is safe, effective and eco-friendly. As per discloser there were three components of ITK: (i) Pest control agent: Chilli, begonia and neem leaves (ii) Containers: Earthen pot, metal bin, tin or plastic container and gunny bags (iii) Fillers: Sand at the bottom and top of the container. Field survey and use of chilli and its options On the matrix ranking of the practioners (Table1), chemical treatment stood highest with 8.25 average points. The farmers are using aluminum phosphide (Celphos) powder for storing their produce. The effectiveness, longevity of storage, ease in application and lower cost of the chemical were the factors responsible for its practice. Safety factor in chemical use recorded the lowest score (6.75). Mustard oil recorded the second rank with 8.19 points, followed by neem leaves (8.12) and dry chilli (8.00). The difference in the score of all the four treatments was, however marginal begunia (Vitex negundo) leaves scored the lowest (7.06). The practioners also reported that dried red chillis are mixed with 1 q. properly dried greengram @ 400 g/q and kept in the containers.
