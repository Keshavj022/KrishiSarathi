 Shelf life of fruits is up to 10 days. Close planting is recommended on trellis/bower system for growth and better management. VRSG-7-17 (Luffa cylindrica L. Roem. Syn. Luffa aegyptica Mill.): An aromatic genotype of sponge gourd has been identified at ICAR-Indian Institute of Vegetable Research (IIVR), Varanasi. The genotype VRSG-7-17 is unique material of sponge gourd with characteristic aroma which resembles with the typical aroma of ‘Basmati rice’ in its various plant parts, viz. fruits, peel, and leaves. The SPME–GC/MS analysis of the volatile compounds of the fruits suggested that the compounds responsible for Basmati rice-like aroma were mainly hexanal, 1-octen- 3-ol, 3-octanone and limonene. The fruits of this novel sponge gourd genotype (VRSG-7-17) also retained its special aroma even after cooking and/or boiling at high temperatures and did not lose fragrance traits at high temperatures. Interestingly, all the duo volatiles were either absent or found in very low concentration in the control sample Kashi Shreya (VRSG-194). The fruits of the genotype (VRSG- 7-17) are light green in colour with average fruit length 27.46 cm, fruit diameter 3.35 cm and fruit weight 156.5 g. Fruits mature at 52-60 days after sowing with an average fruit yield of 1.13 kg per plant. Malvaceous crop The Indian okra, also known as lady’s finger, is another unique vegetable crop in India. The Indian okra has a tough, fibrous stem that makes it particularly suitable for use in stews and curries. It is a popular vegetable in southern India and is often used in sambar and other traditional dishes. The promising unique germplasm registered in okra are given in Table 5.
