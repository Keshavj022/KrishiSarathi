(2002) 142 Treatment for prolapse of vagina in late preganancy In cattle, the vagina sometimes prolapses in late preganancy before calving. As treatment, juice is extract from fresh onions by chopping and pounding. The prolapsed part of vagina, is washed with this juice as a disinfectant and then carefully pushed back in to place. A leather shoe or chapal (also disinfected.) is used when pushing against the surface of the vagina. The animal is then forced to stand and fed the tuber of elephant foot plant locally known as suran (Amorphophallus campanulatus). About 2-3 kg of this, is cut in small pices and given along with other food. It is believed that this plant extract helps in fixation of the uterus. Sometimes a thin rope is tied around the body in the form of a net so as to prevent recurrence of prolapse. Besides this, the slope of ground surface in the cattle shed is kept such that the rear of the anima remains higher than the front. (Vanod, Patdi).
