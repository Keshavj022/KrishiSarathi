 The selected 25 key informants were asked to score the practice by putting stone pieces out of 10 on six criteria. The criteria were rain the same day, rain after 1 day, extent of rain, storm only, clouds only and extent of reliability. The matrix ranking for each criterion were subjected to ANOVA test for significance of difference. common to find such cases. It is only by incidence or chance that such cases are observed both in the field and in the houses. Generally, the ants are observed transferring egg in July only. Further, only one species, i.e. black small ants are seen transferring their eggs.The results of matrix scoring using 25 key informants on six criteria for four alternative observations are given in Table1. Case study The findings suggest the following: The best possible method for validating this ITK under the existing resources is through search and observation of ants transferring their eggs in respect of change in weather and occurrence of rain for the next two or three days. Efforts were made to search such cases from Bareilly, Bulandshahar and Badaun districts of Uttar Pradesh. In all 12 cases were found, and observations were noted. (i) The key informants mostly opined that when ants carry eggs in large numbers, rain will be occurring the same day. The difference between treatments in respect of rain occurring the same was highly significant. (ii) The maximum score was given to treatment 2 (ants with pupae in large numbers) for the criterion rain after 1 day. The difference between treatments in respect of rain after 1 day was highly significant. (iii) Treatment 2 (ants with eggs in large numbers) also scored maximum in respect of extent of rain. The difference between treatments in respect of extent of rain was RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Information collected through pilot study in the area indicated that though the practice is believed to be highly reliable, it is not very Table 1.

The difference between treatments in respect of storm only was significant. (v) The maximum score was given to treatment 2 (ants with eggs in large numbers) for the criterion clouds only. The difference between treatments in respect of clouds only was highly significant.
