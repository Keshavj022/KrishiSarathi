, primary or secondary beneﬁciaries), but not from CBPs, and takes a value of 0 if farmer resides in a non-FLD village. Models 1 and 2 present the impact estimates. Models 3 test for parallel trends across treatment and control groups. Covariates used to perform matching across treatment and control groups before applying DID are as follows: age, age squared, gender, education, household size, caste, source of income, asset index, HH experience, soil color, source of irrigation, plot location (near a road), and average village land size. A kernel procedure is used for performing matching. All regressions are in the common support region. We use an epanechnikov kernel function and the bandwidth parameter equals 0.06. Time-varying district control is the percentage of farmers who received other government extension programs. FLDs = Frontline demonstrations to promote the new wheat variety (HD-2967). CBPs = Capacity-building programs on the varietal evaluation of wheat. Robust standard errors in parentheses. *p < 0.1, **p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001.

The dependent variable takes a value of 1 when wheat farmers adopt HD-2967 and 0 otherwise. Time is a dummy variable. Models 1 and 2 take a value of 1 for 2017–18 and 0 for 2015–16. Model 3 takes a value of 1 for 2015–16 and 0 for 2014–15. In all models, CBP (P) takes a value of 1 if a farmer beneﬁted from CBPs in 2016–17 (i.e., primary beneﬁciaries), but not from FLDs, and takes a value of 0 if the farmer resides in a non-KVK village. Models 1 and 2 present the impact estimates. Model 3 tests for parallel trends across treatment and control groups. Covariates used to perform matching across treat- ment and control groups before applying DID are as follows: age, age squared, gender, education, household size, caste, land holding, source of income, asset index, HH experience, soil color, source of irrigation, plot location (near a road), and average village land size. A kernel procedure is used for performing matching. All regressions are in the common support region. We use an epanechnikov kernel function, and the bandwidth parameter equals 0.06. Time-varying district control is the percentage of farmers who received extension services from other programs. FLDs = Frontline demonstrations to promote the new wheat variety (HD-2967).
