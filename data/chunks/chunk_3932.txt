Chestnuts contain no cholesterol and contain very little fat, mostly unsaturated and no gluten. They have twice as much starch as the potato. In addition, chestnuts contain about 8% of various sugars, mainly sucrose, glucose, fructose and in less amount, stachyose and raffinose. They are the only nuts that contain vitamin C, with about 40 mg per 100 g of raw product. Tannin is contained in the bark as well as in the wood, leaves and seed husks. The husks contain 10–13% tannin. Cultivation: Chestnut is as hardy as peach and can withstand a low temperature of about -29°C in deep dormancy. Trees can be found at an altitude more than July–August 2023 47 of age yield about 26 kg of nuts on an average. Preservation: Besides consuming fresh, chestnuts can also be canned, pureed or preserved in sugar or syrup. Shelled and cooked nuts should be covered, refrigerated and used within three to four days. Cooked chestnuts whole, chopped or pureed, may be frozen in an airtight container and kept up to 9 months. Because of their high water content, transpiration rates and consequent loss in weight, the nuts are used as fresh fruits. They should be kept cool at all times, including in shops when on display for sale. To preserve their freshness for a few months with no artificial refrigeration, the chestnuts can be soaked in cold water for about 20 hours immediately after harvest, after which they are dried in the shade, then layered in dry sand. Culinary: The fruits can be peeled and eaten raw, but it can be somewhat astringent, especially if the pellicle is not removed. Another method of eating the fruit involves roasting or boiling, which does not require peeling. Once cooked, its texture is slightly similar to that of a baked or boiled potato, with a delicate sweet and nutty flavour. This method of preparation is popular in Uttarakhand. Chestnuts can be dried and milled into flour, which can then be used to prepare breads, cakes, pastas or used as thickener for soups and sauces. They can be used to stuff vegetables, poultry, fowl and other edibles. They are available fresh, dried, ground or canned (whole or in puree). A fine granular sugar can be obtained from the fermentation of the juice as well as a beer; the roasted fruit provides a coffee substitute.
