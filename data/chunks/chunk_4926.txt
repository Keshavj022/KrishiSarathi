 Meghdoot weather App: Meghdoot, a joint initiative of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) and Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) aims to deliver critical information to farmers through a simple and easy to use mobile application. The mobile application was developed by the Digital Agriculture research theme at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi- Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Hyderabad, Telangana in collaboration with IITM, Pune and IMD, Delhi. The app seamlessly aggregates contextualized district and crop wise advisories issued by Agro Met Field Units (AMFU) every Tuesday and Friday with the forecast and historic weather information to the fingertips of the farmers. The advisories are also issued in vernacular languages wherever available. Efficient and effective market linkages for horticultural crops: Mobile applications have significantly empowered farmers of horticultural crops by transforming market linkages and enhancing price realization. By enabling direct communication between farmers and buyers, these apps eliminate intermediaries, allowing farmers to negotiate prices that accurately reflect the quality and demand for their produce. This direct access ensures that farmers receive a fair share of the profits while consumers benefit from fresh, competitively priced products. These applications also enhance market selection specifically for horticultural crops by providing real-time data on consumer preferences and market trends. With insights into which fruits and vegetables are in high demand, farmers can make informed decisions about where to sell their crops, maximizing their earnings based on current market conditions. Price discovery is further facilitated through these platforms, giving farmers access to information on prevailing prices for various horticultural products in different markets. This transparency enables competitive bidding, allowing farmers to select the best offers from multiple buyers and optimize their income potential. e-NAM App: The National Agriculture Market (eNAM) is a ground-breaking pan-India electronic trading portal that connects existing Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) to establish a unified national market for agricultural commodities. This innovative platform allows farmers to sell their produce directly to buyers across the country, breaking down geographical barriers and promoting fair competition. By providing access to real-time market prices, e-NAM empowers farmers to make informed decisions about when and where to sell their crops, maximizing their income potential. The e-NAM app facilitates seamless transactions by offering features such as online bidding, price discovery mechanisms, and instant payment options. Additionally, it supports the integration of various services like quality testing and warehousing, enhancing the overall efficiency of the agricultural supply chain.
