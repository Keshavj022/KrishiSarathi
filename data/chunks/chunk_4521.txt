 The Society for Conservation of Mango Diversity (SCMD), empowered the community farmers to appreciate market value and uniqueness of mango diversity as well as on-farm conservation and effective measures for protecting farmersâ€™ variety of the area. Thousands of grafted plants were made in the community nurseries for planting in the orchards. Many farmers came forward to plant these varieties as they could understand the value of unique varieties. The varieties with potential for pickle making were identified and a community based evaluation was made to make the farmers understand about the selection of pickle varieties. Important role of custodian farmers Mango custodian farmers are farmers who maintain, adapt, and promote varieties and related knowledge over time and space in their orchards and are recognized locally for their efforts. Farmers have played a key role in the development of mango varieties and practice on- farm conservation of traditional non-commercial varieties as custodian farmers. In India, local farmers, nurserymen and landlord contributed towards evolving and conserving the varietal diversity. Various motivational factors play role in prompting the custodian farmers for conservation of mango varieties. Diversity fairs promote conservation Mango mela, festival or exhibitions are common and provide platform where farmers can showcase their unique varieties and popularize them in different cities of the country. With the help of CBO many good practices to save these varieties were implemented.
