 Paroda Committee Report ( ‘Review of disciplines and eligibility qualifications for recruitment of ARS Scientists at the entry level’), the 56 disciplines have been re-grouped to fall under 16 Major Subject Groups for the purpose of conducting ICAR-SRF(PGS) examination (Annexure-I). 3.9 Eligibility criteria for the examination The minimum and maximum age limit for eligibility shall be 21 years and 30 years, respectively for General category. The upper age limit for candidates belonging to SC/ST/Women/PC/OBC (Non-creamy layer as per the Central list of OBC) categories shall be relaxable by 5 years. For in-service candidates, the maximum age limit shall be 45 years in all cases as per the extant norms and guidelines. In the general interest of the candidates, the eligibility criteria in respect of OGPA/percentage marks secured at Masters level for appearing in SRF(PGS) examination and admission in Ph.D. degree programmes in various agricultural universities should be uniform across the board. The eligibility criteria for SRF(PGS) Examination as well as admission, therefore, will be as under: 9 “The candidate must have passed Master’s Degree programme securing Overall Grade Point Average(OGPA) of at least 6.50/10.00 scale, 3.25/5.00 scale, 2.60/4.00 scale for General and OBC Categories and 5.50/10.00, 2.75/5.00, 2.20/4.00 scale for SC/ST/Physically Challenged (PC) candidates, respectively. In other cases, where grade-points are not awarded and only marks are awarded, the candidate must have secured at least 60% marks for General/OBC Category. For SC/ST/Physically Challenged (PC) candidates, the minimum percentage of marks will be 50%.” 3.10 Revision of SRF(PGS) syllabus Considering the recent advancements in different disciplines of agriculture and allied sciences vis-à-vis NET/ARS syllabus, the modified and updated syllabus for ICAR SRF (PGS) examination is appended at Annexure-II for adoption. Though the contents in the revised syllabus of ‘Animal Biotechnology’, ‘Agricultural Economics’ and ‘Agricultural Business Management’ subjects differ from that of NET/ARS syllabus, yet keeping in view the recent developments in the field, the same appears to be more apt and should be adopted for SRF(PGS) examination. ***** 10 Annexure-I Major Subject Group Code Major Subject Sub-subject in Ph.D. Proposed Eligibility Qualifications 01 Crop Sciences-I Genetics & Plant Breeding Master’s degree in Agriculture/ Agricultural Botany/Botany/Plant Breeding/Genetics/Genetics and Plant Breeding.
