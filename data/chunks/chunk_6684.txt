 Total 6,811 training conducted under SCSP which were attended by 1,18,485 farmers. Seed- hubs were set-up at 95 KVKs for production of quality seeds of major pulse crops. During the year, 42,835.07 q seeds of pulses were produced and made available to farmers. For crop residue management, demonstrations on CRM machinery on >20,000 ha including 3,000 demonstrations on decomposer technology was conducted. Total 3,778 IFS units were established on 88,406.19 ha. Total 5,894 IFS demonstrations and 9,512 trainings were conducted for 75,058 and 1,17,010 farmers respectively. Advisories on crop and livestock production/protection technologies in 15 different regional languages were circulated among farmers. Total 2,351 interventions to facilitate information about marketing of farm produce benefitting 5.42 lakh farmers were undertaken. Research for Tribal and Hill Regions: For promotion of quality seeds of improved varieties in these disadvantaged areas, 16.138 tonnes breeder seed of 46 varieties/inbreds of 17 crops was produced and 13.121 tonnes breeder seed supplied to seed producing agencies for further multiplication. Besides, 1,313 kg nucleus seed of 49 varieties of 17 crops and 655 kg Truthfully Labeled seed of 20 varieties of 13 crops were produced. Including the carry-over stock, about 402 kg TL seed was supplied to different stakeholders. VLQPM Hybrid maize released for cultivation in North Western Hill Zone and North Eastern Hill Region. VL Dhan 69 released for Uttarakhand, Sikkim and J&K. For Uttarakhand, Maize, VLQPM Hybrid 61, and VLQPM Hybrid 63; wheat, VL Gehun 2028 and VL Gehun 3010; rice, VL Dhan 210, VL Dhan 211 and VL Dhan 70; lentil, VL 150; and field pea, VL 64 were notified. A total eight micro watersheds comprising dairy-based land use, mixed forestry, silvi-pastoral land use, agro-pastoral system, agri-horti-silvi-pastoral, silvi- horticultural system, natural forest block and timber- based land-use system developed and evaluated on a long term basis in Meghalaya. The integration of crops and livestock resulted in maximum income ( 2,71,400) and employment generation (252 man-days excluding family labour). For jhum improvement, one agri-horti- silvi-pastoral system in 1.58 ha developed. The system produced 6,846 kg of rice equivalent yield with a net return of 62,961. Integrated Organic Farming System (IOFS) models were established at Tripura and Meghalaya. The Tripura model gave a net return of about 73,990 and employment of 67 days which is quite high compared to existing farming systems. About 70% of the nutrient requirement of the model was met from nutrient recycling within the model. The Meghalaya model recorded a total net return of 83,360 per year which is much higher than the regionâ€™s farmer common practices of rice mono-cropping or improved practice of the rice-vegetables cropping system.
