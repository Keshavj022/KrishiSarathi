ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 143   Cultivate Groundnut, Cotton, foxtail millet, Bajra, pigeonpea, blackgram and greengram etc. under rainfed / protective irrigation conditions.   In the absence of canal water release, cultivate Jowar / Sunflower / pigeon pea / greengram / green manure - blackgram/ foxtail millet - chickpea / blackgram / maize / fodder maize.   For prekharif Ragi and Korra are recommended for ASR District. Cotton   Sow during June to mid-July in red soils and July to mid-August in black soils. Avoid light red soils without irrigation facilities.   Seed rate: 0.75 to 1.0 kg/acre for Bt. Cotton hybrids   Sow non Bt cotton / redgram around the Bt cotton as refugee crop to avoid build-up of resistance against bollworms.   Inter crop greengram/ blackgram in 2:1 ratio and pigeonpea in 6:1 to 8:1 ratio   Treat the seeds with 80-l00 ml H2SO4 per kg for 2-3 minutes and wash thoroughly with water 2-3 times and with lime.   Use pre-emergence herbicide Pendimethaline @ l.3-1.6 lit/acre immediately after sowing and post emergence herbicides Quizalofop-p ethyl 400 ml + Pyrithiobac sodium 250 ml/acre at 25- 30 DAS. Use mechanical weeders at early stages of crop   Fertilizers and manures: 4 t FYM/acre, 36-18-18 kg N, P2O5 and K2O /acre for American varieties; 48-24-24 kg/ac for conventional hybrids and 25% excess N for Bt hybrids. Appy Phosphorus as basal, N and K in three equal splits at 30, 60, 90 DAS.   Spray 10 g MgSO4/l to manage Mg deficiency at 45 and 70 DAS.   Spray 2 g ZnSO4/l 2-3 times at 7-10 days interval to manage Zn deficiency. Apply 20 kg ZnSO4 per acre in soil once in three years.   Spray 1-1.5 g borax/l at 60-90 DAS twice at weekly intervals to manage boron deficiency.   Spray 2 % urea or 2 % 19:19:19 or 20:20:20 or 21:21:21 or KNO3 to manage drought.
