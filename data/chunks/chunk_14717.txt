 Roughly three fourth of the total K uptake by cereal crops are retained in their residues and it has been estimated that cereal straws have approximately 1.2–1.7% higher K content than other straws (Singh et al., 2002b). This highlights the importance of crop residues as a potential source of K nutrition (Madar et al., 2020; Torma et al., 2018). The impact of CA has been extensively studied with respect to soil carbon enrichment, N and P dynamics (Parihar et al., 2018; Jat et al., 2019; Margenot et al., 2017). However, soil K dynamics under the effect of continuous addition of crop residues has not been addressed adequately. It has been reported that straw being a rich source of K can help in replacing 20–50% of K fertilizer and enhance K availability in soil (Li et al., 2020) thereby making up for the K losses through crop mining over the years without or with little attention on K fertilization. Jat et al. (2018) showed that K fertilizer application can be reduced to 50% after four years of continuous CA through nutrient omission study. The knowledge of soil’s ability to supply K to the crops is critical even more than the amount of K present in soil. Generally, the most common way of assessing K supplying capacity of soil is based on soil K extraction using neutral normal ammonium acetate (NH4OAC). Lack of under­ standing regarding the ability of soil to maintain K in available forms has many times resulted in poor correlation between available K and crop yield (Hosseinpur and Samavati, 2008; Islam et al., 2017), especially in soils with significant amount of clay minerals (Moody and Bell, 2006) and under intensive cropping which led to K depletion over long term (Bhattacharyya et al., 2006; Jalali, 2007; Rupa et al., 2001). Also, NH4OAC has been reported to be inadequate to highlight the changes in K dynamics and K supplying capacity induced by alterations in man­ agement practices over long run (Das et al., 2018; Das et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2017; Zarrabi and Jalali, 2008) as it represents only water soluble and exchangeable K fractions and remains silent regarding plant avail­ able non-exchangeable K fraction. Non-exchangeable K fractions have been reported to play a crucial role (up to 80–100% of total K avail­ ability) in K supply to crops especially under intensive agriculture practices (Hisinger, 2002). In such cases, adopting approaches that takes into consideration of non-exchangeable K fractions are important (Bilias and Barbayiannis, 2018). Potassium dynamics considering K in soil so­ lution and exchange complexes in relation to other basic cations like calcium (Ca++) and magnesium (Mg++) species have been rigorously tested to predict the K+ availability in different soil systems (Evangelou et al., 1994).
