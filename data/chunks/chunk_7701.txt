 Based on drop in sucrose % juice and purity due to delayed Varietal scenario of post-harvest sucrose losses seen in terms of increase in the level of reducing sugar. Application of SMS + BKC formulation checked reducing sugar increase. crushing, CoLk 94184 was found most tolerant to post- harvest deterioration followed by CoPK 05191 and then Co 0238 and finally CoLk 09204. Dense planting: A climate resilient strategy for FCV tobacco: Flue-cured tobacco is grown as rainfed crop during rabi season in an area of approximately 30,000 ha in Alfisols of south coastal Andhra Pradesh comprising Prakasam and Nellore districts of Andhra Pradesh. Soils are poor in fertility and moisture retention. FCV tobacco crop is normally planted with the onset of North-East monsoon. In recent years, the monsoon are getting delayed because of which the crop is not getting enough time to exhibit its full potential and in turn resulting in low yields. In order to enhance the productivity plant population was increased under delayed monsoon condition. Experiments were conducted with different plant populations and results found that increasing plant population by 100% (reducing the plant to plant spacing to half) increased the productivity to an extent of 410 kg/ha. On-farm testing of this technology was carried in farmers’ fields and found 11–26% increase in yield under low productivity areas or in a situation when planting is delayed due to late onset of monsoon and realized an additional net returns of ` 10,200 to 27,000/ha. Three tier cactus based agroforestry system at Bhuj Cactus based three tier agroforestry systems with two trees (Salvadora oleoides and Prosopis cineraria), three cactus pear accessions (CAZRI Botanical garden, Clone 1308 and Bianca macomer) and two grass species (Dichanthium annulatum and Sporobolus marginatus) in 18 different combinations were tested. The combination of Salvadora oleoides + CAZRI Botanical garden + Sporobolus marginatus based silvi-pasture system produced maximum green and dry fodder yields of 10.0 and 3.04 t/ha, respectively. Development of pomegranate based production system for transitional plain of luni basin in western Rajasthan: The recorded system production under one- ha pomegranate based production system for clusterbean, mungbean and okra was 259.9 kg, 275.2 kg and 736.8 kg, respectively during kharif season. Similarly, the yields recorded in mustard, fenugreek and cabbage was 221.3 kg, 235.5 kg and 4037.7 kg, respectively, during rabi season. The total mung bean equivalent yield was about 10 q from one-hectare area of the system, in which highest contribution was from okra (42%) followed by CROP MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 68 mungbean (34%) and clusterbean (24%). The total mustard equivalent yield was about 14 q from one-ha area of the system, in which highest contribution was from cabbage (62%) followed by fenugreek (20%) and mustard (18%).
