The real fruits of molecular genetics to me are yet to boast “Discovery”. UPOV 1991 will be more relevant then. The situation is: Farmer ‘Cultivator’ wants the right to sow and in part trade (sell/exchange) the*saved seed; Farmer ‘Conserver’ having nursed the major realms and basic biomes in their biogeographic locations wants to:be cosharer of profits; Breeder wants formal accreditation of his innovation/ novelty and at the same time access to innovation/novelty products of fellow breeders to generate further innovations/novelties, while the industry wants to negotiate a one-time payment of royalty for trading the innovation/novelty large-scale and just about anywhere. Perhaps its time for the Breeder/Institution and the Farmer "Conserver"/ Community worldwide to become immortal.
