 The demand for avocado has been increasing in India, primarily due to changing dietary habits and a growing awareness of the fruit’s health benefits. Avocados are consumed both fresh and in March–April 2024 23 Flowering behaviour of avocado tree various processed forms. Along with this, some state governments started initiatives and schemes to promote avocado cultivation. Farmers may receive support in terms of subsidies, technical guidance and access to quality planting material. All this may encourage Indian farmers to cultivate avocado on a commercial scale. Flowering behaviour of avocado Avocado flowering is a crucial stage in the life cycle of an avocado tree, as it marks the beginning of fruit development. Avocado trees flower profusely, producing 1-10 lakh flowers. Even with so many flowers, yield is typically low. Indeed, fruit set ranges between 0.001 and 0.23%, depending on cultivar and climatic conditions. Thus, avocado has earned a reputation as a shy and erratic bearer. Flowers are complete and perfect with a rare flowering mechanism called ‘protogynous diurnally synchronized dichogamy’ (PDSD). The flowering season varies depending on the specific avocado variety and the region in which the tree is planted. In India, avocado trees start flowering in the month of December and continue up to February. In some regions, avocado can flower multiple times a year. Based on flowering morphology, avocado cultivars are categorized into two types viz. Type A and Type B. Type A trees flowers open as functional female in the morning and close in the evening and again in the following day, it opens as a functional male in the afternoon. While, Type B trees open as functional females in the afternoon and functional male in the next day morning. Having both types of trees nearby can improve cross pollination. Understanding the factors influencing avocado flowering can help growers optimize conditions for a successful harvest. Local climate, soil conditions and proper care practices all contribute to the overall health and productivity of avocado trees. Flowering to fruit maturity After successful pollination, the fertilized ovaries begin to develop into fruit. Fruit enlargement occurs rapidly as a result of high rate of cell division and expansion, but unlike other fruit, cell division continues throughout fruit development phase. The initial stages of fruit development are critical and the factors like weather conditions and pollination success play key roles. The young fruit starts to grow and proper care and suitable environmental conditions help for healthy development. Adequate water, nutrients and protection from pests and diseases contribute to robust fruit growth. Avocado fruit matures on the tree and the time it takes varies based on the avocado variety and environmental conditions. It usually takes several months to reach maturity.
