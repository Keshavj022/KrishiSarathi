Muscle transcriptome identified 20,226 mRNAs out of which 15,170 were across the samples. Expression of genes related to early determination (MYF5, MYOD1) and myoblast fusion (MYMX and MYMK) were higher in Hampshire than Mali even though levels of several myogenesis related genes (MYF6, MYOG, MSTN) were similar. During the study, 1,549 differentially methylated regions were identified. The number of fibres per fascicle and expression of myogenic marker proteins (MYOD1, MYOG and PAX7) was more in Hampshire as compared to Mali breed of pig. Common transcripts both in Mali and Hampshire muscle samples revealed enrichment of genes (>1.5 fold enrichment) related to various myogenic process. Developed economic and nutritionally balanced silage based pig feed: Silage was prepared following standard procedure from vegetable wastes adding Livestock Improvement icar annual report 2022-23 66 jaggery (gur) at the rate of 3 kg per 100 kg raw chaffed vegetable waste for suitable anaerobic fermentation in silage bags. Vegetable waste silage had DM, CP, EE, CF, NFE and ash as 67.5, 18.25, 1.95, 18.5, 49.1 and 12.2% on DM basis, respectively. The in vitro DM digestibility was found as 69.34, 67.26 and 65.61% respectively for feeds containing 8, 10 and 12% crude fibre (CF) level. Artificial Insemination at farmers’ field: A total of 1,934 liquid boar semen doses were produced and supplied for artificial insemination in pigs at the farmers’ field and organized farms. Methylation of genome in relation with expression of myogenesis associated genes: (A) Methylation in the promoter region of MYMK gene in Mali as compared to Hampshire breed of pig; (B) No difference in the methylation in the promoter region could be observed with respect to MYF5 gene; (C) Circos plot showing genome wide methylation in Mali and Hampshire breed of pigs CARI-Dhawal (Frizzle plumaged cross of Desi with WLH): The dual type climate resilient white plumaged cross was developed for efficient egg production in intense summers/tropical conditions. Its laying capacity is about 260- 275 eggs per annum. CARI-Prabal (cross of Aseel): Birds are active, large in built, pugnacious in nature. They are able to save themselves from their predators due to their fighting characters and activeness and are adapted to all climatic zones of the country.
