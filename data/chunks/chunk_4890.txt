 To make these technologies widely accessible and impactful, governments, research institutions, and private organizations must collaborate to ensure that AI-driven solutions reach farmers around the world, helping to realize the full benefits of AI in agriculture. SUMMARY AI-driven approaches offer several advantages, including the ability to process vast datasets, predict outcomes under changing climatic conditions, and provide real-time insights to farmers. By automating the process, AI tools can significantly enhance the precision of suitability assessments, ensuring that land use is optimized for crop cultivation. However, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for the direct suitability mapping of horticultural crops in India remains limited. Most suitability mapping efforts for crops like, oil palm, litchi, and other horticultural species have relied on traditional methods such as GIS, remote sensing, and analytical hierarchy processes (AHP). These techniques assess environmental variables like soil, temperature, and rainfall to identify potential cultivation zones. While AI has revolutionized various areas of agriculture, its application in crop suitability mapping for horticulture is yet to be fully explored in India. Instead, AI tools have primarily been leveraged for broader applications like monitoring plantations, detecting disease and pest incidence, and identifying nutrient deficiencies in crops like oil palm, tea, and sugarcane. These models effectively utilize satellite imagery, high- resolution data, and sensor inputs to provide real-time insights, significantly improving precision agriculture practices. For instance, ML algorithms such as random forests and neural networks have shown high accuracy in identifying nutrient deficiencies and pest outbreaks, which directly enhance crop yields and productivity. The potential for AI in crop suitability mapping is immense. With continuous advancements in data collection through remote sensing and AI technologies, India has the opportunity to implement AI-driven tools to increase the precision and accuracy of horticultural crop management. Such advancements would optimize resource utilization, boost productivity, and promote sustainable agricultural practices by identifying the best-suited areas for specific crops under varying climatic conditions.
