 For example, avoid cultivation of long duration varieties in transplanted paddy in Punjab, adhere to sowing windows depending on cultivar in bastmati rice and complete sowing of cotton by mid-May.   Looking into vast coverage of Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) in more than five lakh hectares in last two years, there is need to popularise DSR in newer areas by demonstrating good weed management practices. Further, there is need to promote herbicide tolerant basmati rice to save natural resources. Line and Machine transplanting on custom hiring basis is also advised.   Seed treatment with recommended chemicals/ bio-pesticides/ bio-inoculants in all crops especially where farm saved seed/ untreated commercial seed is used to improve seed germination, better crop stand, pest and disease and higher productivity.   Nutrient management and fertilizer application in all crops to be based on soil test to save on input use and reduce cost of cultivation. For example, phosphorous application in transplanted paddy/ direct seed rice / basmati rice can be skipped if P fertilizer was applied to preceding wheat crop. Similarly, in fields where green manuring has been practiced, urea application may be reduced in paddy.

Integrated crop and pest management is important in crop expansion of oilseed crops to non-traditional areas as in the case of soybean (73 districts), sunflower (63 districts) and sesame (59 districts) and nutri-cereal crops (202 districts) and exotic crops.   In rainfed areas, best bet drought proofing practices have been suggested such as tolerant short duration varieties, in situ soil moisture conservation practices and planting methods and increase in-field crop diversity through intercropping and crop combinations depending on agro-ecology.   In livestock, poultry, small ruminants and fisheries, best practices related to selection of disease free and tolerant breeds, feed and health management have been recommended in the advisories.
