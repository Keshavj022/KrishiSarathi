Intercropping is the practise of growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land in clearly defined rows in order to increase production per unit of space. It is a better and sustainable approach to make excellent use of the vacant space during the early growth stages of autumn planted sugarcane (3 to 4 months). Because of its wide spacing and slow growth, sugarcane is a long duration crop that provides ample opportunity for intercropping with short duration, high-value crops that generate income. This allows for increased household nutrition and economic security, especially for small and marginal cane growers. This may improve the area used for autumn planting. Sugarcane + French bean (1: 2) intercropping showed the higher cane equivalent yield (106.0 t/ha) and net returns (`1, 87,400.0/ha) over sole sugarcane. The percentage increase in cane equivalent yield and net returns under sugarcane + French bean (1: 2) intercropping over sole sugarcane was 16.2 and 22.7%, respectively. Keywords: Autumn sugarcane, French bean, Intercropping, System productivity I n India sugarcane is grown on 5.3 million hectares, with an average productivity of 80.0 t/ha, and is a major source of sugar in tropical and subtropical regions. The total area in Bihar planted to this crop is 0.26 million ha, with an average yield of 49.0 t/ha. The focus has changed from sole cropping to intercropping in recent years. Since sugarcane is a crop that takes a long time to cover the ground, requires wider spacing (75 to 150 cm), and grows slowly up to the period of 90 to 120 days, it results in one of the most fruitful, sustainable and economically successful intercropping systems. Production of more crops per unit area, optimum resource usage, and crop yield stabilization are the three main goals of intercropping.
