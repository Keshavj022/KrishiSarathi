 By utilizing predictive analytics, stakeholders can forecast demand more accurately, allowing for better inventory management. Machine learning models can analyze historical sales data, weather patterns, and market trends to predict the shelf-life of various produce items. By aligning production with actual demand, farmers and distributors can minimize excess supply that leads to waste. Additionally, real-time monitoring systems can detect spoilage at an early stage, enabling quick responses to salvage affected batches or redirect them to processing facilities rather than allowing them to go to waste. The extensive data collected through various digital tools provide valuable insights into consumer preferences, market trends, and product performance.

The drive to the metering unit is derived from the ground wheel. A shoe-type furrow opener is fitted to the planting frame in front of onion bulb delivery tube. A funnel-shaped box was also fitted at the bottom of the seed delivery tube to prevent spillage of the onion bulb outside the furrow. This ensures an uninterrupted free-fall of the onion bulb from metering disc to furrow. The furrow opener assembly was mounted independent to the planter unit hence it can be positioned as required to ensure proper row spacing. The effective field capacity of the machine was 0.3 ha/h with field efficiency of 75%.

Patel T RADITIONAL methods of crop suitability mapping have largely relied on historical data, expert insights, and manual observations. This process typically involves assessing soil characteristics (such as pH, texture, and organic content), temperature patterns, rainfall, and other climatic factors. However, these approaches can be time-consuming, labour-intensive, and sometimes prone to inaccuracies due to human error or incomplete data. Advancements in crop suitability mapping In recent years, advancements in data collection and analysis have transformed crop suitability mapping, making it far more efficient and accurate. Three key technologies—remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and artificial intelligence (AI)—are now revolutionizing how farmers, researchers, and policymakers evaluate land for agricultural purposes. Remote sensing for real-time data collection: Remote sensing involves collecting data about the Earth’s surface from satellites, drones, or other aerial platforms.
