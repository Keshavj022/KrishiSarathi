The requirements for 5G broadly cover three main usage scenarios as shown in in figure 9- e Mobile loT/ Massive loT/ LPWAN: improved network coverage, long device operational life time and a high density of connections. This is also known as Massive MTC (mMTC).

This is also known as Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC).  Enhanced Mobile Broadband: Improved performance and a more seamless user experience accessing multimedia content for human-centric communications. This is also known as Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB). (Source: ITU-R Rec. M.2083) Figure 9: 5G Usage Scenarios 5G technologies in precision agriculture will ensure greater profitability and efficient utilization of resources by use of automated tractors / harvesters, precision seeders, and automated weed & pest controllers. Drones with 5G technology may be used for efficient & precise spraying of fertilizers in fields, and also to scan and identify unwanted weeds through the use of AI. It will help farmers to better organize and allocate their time and attention towards areas that really need it. Massive MTC and uRLLC features of 5G may also be used for remote monitoring and maintenance of machines centrally and that data could be transmitted in real-time.
