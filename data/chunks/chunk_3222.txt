in 111 2002 ‐ 2007 • Fenpyroximate @ 15‐30 g ai/ha, flufenzin @ 80‐100 g ai/ha, milbemectin @ 3‐4 g ai/ha and clofentezine @ 250‐300 g ai/ha, were able to cause 70% reduction of Tetranychus urticae infesting tomato. Similarly diafenthiuron has also been effective at 300‐600 g ai/ha against this mite infesting tomato and rose and at 200 g ai/per ha on brinjal diafenthiuron @ 0.08% was also able to control T.urticae infesting rose. • Chlorfenapyr (75 g ai/ha) Bifenthrin (80 g ai/ha), fenpropathrin (45 g ai/ha), milbemectin (4‐5 g ai/ha), clofentezine (250‐300 g ai/ha), flufenzin (80‐100 g ai/ha) and fenazaquin (125 g ai/ha) were found to be effective against Polyphagotarsonemus latus infesting chillies but the effectiveness lasted for seven days only, compared to 10‐14 days in dicofol (0.05%). Diafenthiuron at 300 g ai /ha can reduce the population of this mite by 93% in 15 days, similarly fenpyroximate (0.006%) and buprofezin (0.03%) were also highly effective. • Propargite @ 570 g ai/ha was effective in controlling Tetranychus sp on cowpea, okra, cucumber and brinjal by causing almost 80% mortality. Spiromesifen @ 96 g ai/ha and Fenazaquin @ 125 g.a.i per ha were also effective against the brinjal mite, causing 75% mortality. • Propargite, dicofol or ethion caused 78% mortality of the spider mite infesting mung bean and continued to be effective for two weeks. • To control Steneotarsonemus spinki on rice, application of fenazaquin @ 125 gai/hectare or diafenthiuron @ 300‐600 g ai/ha or propargite 0.05% or dicofol @0.05% were effective. Whereas abamectin @ 0.5ml/ltr of water and fenazaquin @ 1ml/litre of water were found effective against Oligonychus oryzae, the rice leaf mite. www.icar.org.in 112 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science All India Network Project on Agricultural Ornithology 1.

Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): • Developed the low cost technology of protecting the crop with Reflective Ribbon • Standardized the technique of wrapping maize leaves around cobs at the grain maturity stage. • Copper Oxycloride @ 3g/kg seed showed very effective in controlling bird damage during sprouting stage in maize & groundnut. • Raising maize & Sorghum fodder as screen to the main crop (maize) showed significant reduction in the activity of depredatory birds. • Wrapping along with reflective ribbon proved very effective in controlling bird damage in maize. • Developed IBPM methods for the management of depredatory species at the vulnerable stage of the crop.
