 Rest of the agronomic practices are like mustard Toria Varieties: RSPT-l, RSPT-2, RSPT-6 2 kg of seed is required to sow one-acre area with 12:7:4 kg/acre of NPK. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 48 First week of September is the optimum time of sowing Chickpea Excess rainfall, heavy soil moisture either at time of sowing or at flowering stage are deleterious to crop growth Varieties: K-468, C-235m, Gaurav, GNG-469, 1581, CSJ-515, DCP 92-3 Seed rate: For bold seeded varieties 30-32 kg seed / acre and for small seed varieties 24-26 kg/acre of seed is recommended. Optimum time of sowing is Mid-October in rows 30 cm apart. Before sowing, the seed should be inoculated with ‘Rhizobium culture’. 35 kg//acre DAP is sufficient as nutritional requirement for the crop. Pendimethalin 30 EC formulation + Imazethapyr 2 % (ready mix combination) @ 400 g/acre as pre-emergence + one hoeing at 30- 35 DAS is recommended for weed control. For management of pod borer, spray the crop with novaluron 10EC @ 1ml/litre or profenofos 50 EC @ 2ml/litre or NSKE (Neem extract) 5% @ 1g/litre water at pod initiation stage. Repeat the spray after 15 days of spraying if need arises. Lentil It requires cold climate & can tolerate frost and severe. Varieties: L-4147 (PusaVaibhav), PL-406 (Angoori), DPL 15 (Priya), DPL 62 (Sheri) The optimum time of sowing is from last week of October to second week of November. Usually, 16 kg seed is required for sowing in one acre area in lines 20 to 22 cm apart by Kera method. For effective weed control, pendimethalin @ 0.4 kg/acre as pre- emergence integrated with one hand weeding at 60 DAS is recommended. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 49 Berseem It provides nutritious and palatable fodder from repeated cuttings throughout winter and early summer in sub-tropical conditions Berseem thrives best in sub-humid and moderately cool climate Varieties: Mescavi, BL-1, BL-10, Wardan, Pusa Giant Best time of sowing is first fortnight of October with 10-12 kg of seed/acre. Mixing of mustard seed @ 0.4 kg with berseem seed increases the quantity of fodder at first cut. For effective control of Poaannua apply fluchloralin @ 0.4kg/ha in 200 litres of water just before sowing. Apply 20kg of phosphorus and 12 kg of N/ acre at the time of sowing and 12 kg N as top dressing after first cut. On light soil, irrigation may be given within 3-5 days after sowing whereas, on heavy soils it may be delayed for 8-10 days. For management of Stem Rot, spray copper oxychloride@ 0.3%. Oats Oats makes best growth in cool and moist climate. High temperature at flowering stage increases proportion of empty spikelets and reduces the seed yield. Varieties: Kent, HFO-114, Sabzaar (SKO-7), Palampur-1 The most suitable time of sowing is Mid-October to 1stweek of November using 40 kg/acre of seed keeping the lines 20-25 cm apart. Apply 16 kg N and 16 kg P2O5/acre and 8 kg K2O at the time of sowing and 16 kg N/ acre after taking the 1st cut of fodder i.e.
