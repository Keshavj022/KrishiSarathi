 Cowdung ash helps in controlling the weeds in cabbage crop. Mixing cowdung ash makes the soil porous and more fertile. Germination of cabbage seed is advanced by about 10 days by treating the seeds with cow urine. A majority of the farmers revealed that the method of control of insects in cabbage using cow urine is now declining, as the farmers are now adopting modern method of chemical application for insect-pest control. Aged cow urine is prepared by storing the fresh urine underground in the earthern pot for about a week. Experiment Comparative effect of different concentrations of aged cow urine spray on aphid population and growth of cabbage. The results obtained are given in Tables 1,2 and 3 and depicted in Fig 1. Unsprayed (control) cabbage showed an initial increase in aphid population, followed by a plateau. This plateau observed may be due to a balance in the rate of loss (migration and death) and gain (birth). In the treated cabbage with aged cow urine, significant decline in aphid population was observed after 10 days, showing very effective eradication of aphids. The initial rise in number of aphids in treated cabbage plants up to day 10th  HORTICULTURAL CROPS Table 1.

After 10 days, the number of aphids declined significantly under all urine concentration treatments. But significant effect could be observed either on the number of leaves or plant height, indicating that these parameters remained almost indifferent to all the treatments. The observed final plant height showed no significant difference between treated and untreated cabbage plants. Full control of aphid population was Fig. 1. Effect of different concentrations of aged cow urine spray on the number of aphids per plant obtained after day 35 in urine treatments. This phenomenon was observed much earlier with higher concentrations. There was a consistent positive effect in controlling the aphid population and the differences were significant.
