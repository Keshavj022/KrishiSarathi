 The findings high­ light the prospects for lowering carbon emissions and demonstrate the paramount significance of input use in evaluating the CO2 in cropping Table 5 GHGE from major crops in Punjab (kg co2 eq. ha−1).

Cotton seemed to be more energy-efficient in comparison, but this was because paddy cultivation by transplanting requires more inputs overall, including higher electricity prerequisites. The study’s findings demon­ strated that non-renewable energy sources are primarily used in agri­ cultural operations, with paddy having the highest level (35.00 GJha-1) followed by cotton (22.01 GJ ha−1), wheat (18.87 GJ ha−1), sugarcane (18.23 GJ ha−1), and maize (17.80 GJ ha−1). Due to highly mechanized operations for all crops, it was discovered that the energy equivalents of electricity and fuel (diesel) were greater in comparison to seeds, (chemical) crop protection, and farmyard manure. Additionally, the analysis of carbon emissions showed that the range of GHGE was be­ tween 1289.12 kg CO2 eq. ha−1 (maize) to 6718.76 kg CO2 eq. ha−1 (paddy), respectively. The significantly high emissions in paddy are primarily caused by the explicit usage of fuel (diesel) from tillage to harvesting, which directly impacts the emissions. Since paddy is typi­ cally submerged in water while being grown, paddy necessitates a lot of water and results in high energy usage and hence, the CO2 emissions. Acknowledging the current GHGE scenarios in Punjab, the study’s findings offer several significant policy alternatives to ensure the agri­ cultural system’s sustainability. The reallocation of crop-mix and redistribute the cropland by shifting the paddy growing areas to the other crops having low water requirements. Also, incorporating pump­ ing equipment’s with better power usage efficiency and precision fertilization management could be ameliorative.
