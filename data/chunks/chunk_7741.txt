 ear head length, ear head weight, no of grains/ear, and 1,000 grain weight were recorded the highest in drip with mulch. The highest yield and water productivity of 6.05 tonnes/ha and 2.20 kg/m3, respectively, were observed under drip irrigation with mulch whereas the lowest were recorded under flood irrigation (4.62 tonnes/ha and 0.66 kg/m3). The findings indicated improvement in grain yield and water productivity of rice and wheat under micro irrigation systems over conventional methods of cultivation.

Electro-chemical flocculation method was used to harvest micro-algae. A system was developed, which includes a 2.5 m3 transparent rectangular tank, voltage excitation arrangements and electrodes. The electrical current was supplied through 6 aluminium electrodes for electro- chemical flocculation. The current initiated the neutralization of algal cells by Al3+ cations and caused flocculation of algal cells which floated on top. Harvesting efficiency of 93% was observed using this method with an energy consumption of 2.71 kWh/kg. Assessment of reliability of rainwater harvesting system: The rooftop rainwater harvesting (RWH) is an effective strategy to meet the increasing demand of Controlled storage structure for onion A controlled storage structure (27 ± 2°C and RH of 60–65% with air circulation system) of 2 tonnes capacity for onions was designed and developed under Public Private Partnership mode. The total losses were 7.14% in controlled storage structure as compared to 54% losses in ventilated storage structure without any control of temperature and relative humidity. Design of controlled storage structure Low cost farm level milk cooling system In the first phase of the study, environment test chamber was designed so as to allow for testing of refrigeration system round the year without having a significant effect of seasons. The purpose of the test chamber was to evaluate the refrigeration system of low cost farm level milk cooling system.
