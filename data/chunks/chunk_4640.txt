The materials were highly variable and single plant selection was carried out till the progeny became homozygous. This variety was identified by IARI Variety Release Committee, recommended for release by the Delhi State Seed Sub-Committee on 19th Dec, 2017 and notified by the Central Sub Committee on Crop Standard, Notification and Release of varieties for Horticultural Crops vide S.O. 692 (E) in 2019 for cultivation in the National Capital Region of Delhi including Delhi and adjoining areas in the states of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh in kharif. Research T HE plants of Pusa Safed Baingan-1 are non-spiny with semi erect branches. The leaves are green with green mid-ribs and veins, attaining a height of 85-90 cm at peak fruiting stage. Flowers are light purple in colour. The fruits are small oval round, egg shaped and average fruit weight is 50-60 g with non-spiny green calyx. The fruits are borne in clusters. It is an early variety having a maturity period between 50-55 days from transplanting to first fruit harvest. The average fruit yield of the variety is 35 t/ha and the performance over the years in IARI, New Delhi and different locations are given in Table 1 and Table 2. Brinjal is one of the vegetables having highest antioxidant activities owing to its high content of phenolics and Pusa Safed Baingan-1 is having high total phenolic content (31.21 mg GAE/100 g) with high antioxidant activity (3.48 CUPRAC μ moltrolox/g, 2.58 FRAP μ moltrolox/g) (Table 3). The growers will be benefited because of its attractive white coloured fruit, high yielding, non-spiny calyx and less number of seed at marketable stage.
