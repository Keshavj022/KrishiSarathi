 Carrot IC623130 and IC642961 22088 VRCAR-252 is a petalod-CMS line of black carrot with better heterotic potential for root yield and uniformity. The roots of VRCAR-252 are excellent source of plant derived anthocyanins (278 mg/100 g FW) and phenolics (323 mg GAE/100 g FW); having better anthocyanin yield potential (67 kg/ha); and greater antioxidative ability (FRAP value of 47 µmol TE/g FW) i.e. 28-times higher than red/ orange/ yellow carrots. VRCAR-252 and its maintainer are ideally synchronous in flowering/pollination activities which facilitate proper pollination and maximum seed set in CMS line. Carrot IC623137 and IC642958 22160 VRCAR-214 is a petaloid-CMS line of red carrot with better heterotic potential for root yield, uniformity and lycopene content; valuable for development of potential F1 hybrids; and cost-effective multiplication of hybrid seeds. The CMS line (VRCAR-214) and its maintainer (Kashi Arun) are ideally synchronous in flowering/ pollination activities which facilitate proper pollination and maximum seed set in CMS line. The roots of VRCAR-214 are good source of lycopene (7.3-7.5 mg/100 g FW) and beta-carotene (3.25-3.50 mg/100 g FW). Carrot IC635036 and IC635037 20115 Dark purple (black) colour main season tropical carrot CMS line developed indigenously. It has ‘petaloid’ type sterility and stable and easy to distinguish. Its roots are of acceptable size and of self core. It is suitable for main season sowing, i.e mid-September onwards in north Indian plains. Carrot IC598343 and IC637028 20116 First red colour main season tropical carrot CMS line developed indigenously. Roots are of acceptable size and suitable for main season sowing, i.e. from mid-September onward in North Indian plains. Carrot IC635034 and IC635035 21056 IPC HT2A is first red colour heat tolerant tropical carrot CMS line developed indigenously. Roots are of acceptable size, red colour and self-core. It is only CMS line which is suitable for early season sowing due to its Pusa Vrishti (IPC HT2) genotype background Carrot IC635038 and IC635039 21090 PC 11A Orange is the first orange colour main season tropical carrot CMS line developed indigenously. Roots are of acceptable size and suitable for main season sowing, i.e. from mid September onward in north Indian plains. It has petaloid type sterility and stable and easy to distinguish. Radish IC642005 and IC642006 21220 Cytoplasmic Male Sterile (CMS) line having lyrate leaf shape and blunt root (almost cylindrical root shape). Good combiner and higher heterosis for yield (12.5-33.6%), root length (6.5-32.4%) and root weight (17.2-30.0%) during winter season. ICAR-IIVR, Varanasi, UP is first to develop CMS line of radish among Public Sector Organizations in India, and will be available on public domain after its registration. Radish IC643967 22048 High tolerance to irrigation water salinity (ECiw 8-10 dS/m) and soil sodicity (pH 8.5) Radish IC625064 and IC625065 20032 Cytoplasmic Male Sterile (CMS) line.
