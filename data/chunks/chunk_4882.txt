 Challenges in the adoption of digital technologies The adoption of digital technologies for postharvest management of fruits and vegetables presents numerous benefits; however, has several challenges including technological barriers, data privacy concerns, cyber security, high initial costs, skills gaps, and scalability issues. Technological barriers and infrastructure limitations are among the most significant obstacles to the adoption of digital technologies in postharvest management. Limited internet connectivity, inadequate power supply, and lack of access to modern storage facilities can impede the implementation of digital solutions. Stakeholders may also be reluctant to adopt technologies that require sharing data with third parties due to fears of data breaches or misuse. Additionally, as more devices become interconnected, the risk of cyberattacks increases. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or disruption of operations, undermining trust among stakeholders. Besides, high initial costs, concerns regarding return on investment (ROI) represent another barrier to widespread adoption. The skills and knowledge gap among stakeholders’ poses a significant challenge in the successful implementation of digital technologies in postharvest management. Scalability and interoperability issues also complicate the adoption of digital technologies in the postharvest sector. Many digital solutions are designed as stand-alone systems, making it challenging to integrate them with existing technologies and processes. Furthermore, as businesses grow and operations expand, scaling up digital solutions can be complex and costly. SUMMARY The integration of digital technologies in the postharvest management of fruits and vegetables has ushered in a new era of efficiency, quality, and sustainability within the horticultural supply chain. By leveraging advanced tools such as IoT devices, machine learning algorithms, and blockchain technology, stakeholders can significantly enhance various aspects of postharvest operations. One of the most significant benefits of digital technologies is the enhancement of efficiency and the reduction of losses throughout the postharvest process. With the deployment of IoT devices, real-time monitoring of environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, becomes feasible. Advanced quality assessment tools, such as machine learning algorithms and computer vision systems, enable precise grading of fruits and vegetables based on visual attributes like colour, size, and surface defects. Moreover, blockchain technology enhances food safety by providing an immutable record of the product’s journey, including details about handling practices and any treatments applied. Advanced analytics platforms allow stakeholders to model and simulate different storage conditions and transportation routes, identifying the optimal parameters for specific types of produce.
