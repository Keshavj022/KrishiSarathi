33 Appendix Table B13 presents estimates of the impact of improvements in rural road infrastructure on these four indices. 33 Each index is defined to be the equally weighted average of z-scores of its components, where the z-scores are calculated by subtracting the baseline mean and dividing by the baseline standard deviation. The components for the staple crop cultivation include an indicator for whether the household cultivates any cereal crops and an indicator for the use of cereal HYVs. The components for the crop diversification index include an indicator for whether the household cultivates any non-cereal crops and an indicator for the use of non-cereal HYVs. The components for the farm inputs index include indicators for whether the household purchases HYV seeds, irrigation, manure and fertilizer. The components for the market activity index include an indicator for any crop sales, an indicator for HYV crop sales, crop value and empirical profits.

I run the regression in Eq. (6) with 𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑣equals 1 if village 𝑣receives a program road between 2007 and 2010. I drop all program-eligible households that received roads before 2007; the relevant control group consists of program-eligible villages that received program roads after 2010 (N(treatment villages)=9, N(control villages)=13). Outcome in Column (1) is an indicator that equals 1 if the household engages in any agricultural cultivation. Outcome in Column (2) is an indicator that equals 1 if the household engages in cultivation of non-cereal crops. Outcome in Column (3) is the share of gross land cultivated under non-cereal crops. Outcome in Column (4) is an indicator that equals 1 if the household uses high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of non-cereal crops. Non-cereal crops include fruits and vegetables, pulses, oilseeds, fiber crops, sugarcane, spices, drugs and plantation crops. Outcome in Columns (5)–(8) is an indicator that equals 1 if the household purchases high-yielding variety (HYV) seeds, irrigation, manure, and chemical fertilizer respectively.
