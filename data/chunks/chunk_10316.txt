 1970 The first major attempt to estimate the Potential Yield of fishery resources in the Indian Ocean region using primary productivity estimates. 1974 Purse seining in the small-scale mechanized sector started for the first time. 1977 Indo-Polish Industrial Fishery Survey for Pelagic resources. 1980 Marine Fisheries Census covering 7 maritime states carried out. 1982 Mini purse seine called ring seine was introduced. 1991- 2018 Potential Yield Estimation (PYE) of the marine fishery resources from the Indian EEZ in 1991, 2000, 2011 and 2018. 1992 Tuna longlining became an established method of fishing for deep-sea fisheries. 2005-16 Marine Fisheries Census was conducted in 2005, 2010 and 2016. 2016 Energy Efficient Green Fishing Vessel FV Sagar Harita launched. 2021 Stock assessment of 67 stocks of marine finfish and shellfish was carried out. 2.1.2. Inland fisheries The establishment of the Central Inland Fisheries Research Station on 17th March 1947 at Barrackpore, West Bengal which was elevated to a full-fledged institute in 1959 - the Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute (CIFRI), was a testament to the R&D thrust given by the Government of India for the development of open-water fisheries even before the independence of the country. The country’s inland water resources include 29,000 kilometers of rivers, 0.3 million hectares (Mha) of estuaries, 0.19 Mha of backwaters and lagoons, 3.5 Mha of reservoirs, 0.5 Mha of floodplain wetlands, and 0.72 Mha of upland lakes, which annually contribute approximately 1.3 Mt of fish. 2.1.2.1. Riverine and estuarine fisheries India’s river systems consist of 14 large rivers, 44 medium rivers, and an infinite number of tiny rivers and desert streams. Studies have shown that the fish production of these riverine systems varies from 0.64 to 1.64 tons per km with an average of 1 t km-1. With a combined length of 12,500 kms and a drainage area of 1,060,000 km2, the River Ganga and its tributaries have garnered considerable attention from scholars since the independence of the country. Over the years, the construction of barrages in the majority of its tributaries has resulted in flow diversion, resulting in decreased fish capture and species variety loss Achievements in Fisheries and Aquaculture in Independent India 177 (Payne et al. 2004). In general, Indian major carp, followed by catfish, murrels, and other miscellaneous species, contribute to fish catches in major riverine systems, except peninsular rivers, where endemic species predominate. Extensive research has been conducted to highlight critical variables like overfishing, habitat damage, pollution, sedimentation, and water abstraction that have contributed to the catch declines over the years. While the introduction of non-selective gear with a reduced mesh size has slowed the recruitment of important commercial species, damaging fishing techniques such as dynamiting and poisoning pose hazards to biodiversity.
