 The study revealed that genome has 914 contigs (primary 396 contigs and Discovery of new fish species-Pangasius silasi (top); Osteobrama serrata (bottom) Germplasm Species Breed Number of doses Semen Cattle Bargur 3,022 Semen Cattle Khillar 4,000 Semen Cattle Dangi 1,000 Semen Cattle Rathi 1,500 Epididymal sperms Goat Gaddi 317 Epididymal sperms Goat Marwari 500 Epididymal sperms Sheep Gaddi 123 Somatic cells Camel Double hump 404 Total 10,866 Fish Discovery of new fish species: ICAR-NBFGR, Lucknow, during survey of water bodies of Peninsular and North-east India, discovered two new fish species. These species were identified on the basis of morphological features, osteology and molecular characterization. The fish species discovered were: Pangasius silasi, from Nagarjuna Sagar Dam of Krishna River System, Andhra Pradesh, and Osteobrama serrata sp. nov., from Jiri River in Manipur. GENETIC RESOURCES DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 29 alternate 518 contigs). Genome completeness showed 423 genes conserved among eukaryotes with 98.6% completeness. Protein-coding genes (18,622) were predicted from genome assembly. Functional annotation of predicted genes assigned Gene Ontology (GO) terms to 14,819 protein-coding genes. Total 24,226 genes were assigned with GO terms in biological process (BP), 18,135 genes in molecular function (MF) and 14,081 genes in cellular component (CC). Additionally, 5,700 genes belonging to metabolic pathways were annotated. These genes were functionally categorized into 4 major processes- cellular processes (1,611 genes), environmental information processing (1,114 genes), genetic information processing (2,025 genes) and metabolism (1,604 genes). Maximum number of genes were involved in signal transduction followed by those involved in cell growth and transport. The study will help in understanding the pathway of A. invadens infection in fish.  5. Crop Improvement Crop improvement Crop improvement is the mandate of Crop Science Division, which is the largest division of ICAR. It has one deemed to be university, 19 national institutes, 3 bureaux, 3 project directorates, 2 national research centres, 32 all-India coordinated research projects and all-India network projects, four Consortia Research Platforms and other projects like Technology Missions on Cotton and Jute, Incentivizing Research in Agriculture, Application of Micro-organisms in Agriculture and Allied Sectors (AMAAS), Microbial Genomic Resources Repository Network and Seed Production in Agricultural Crops and Fisheries. There are eight major schemes, viz.
