  Use resistant varieties like Jwala (48‐1) and GCH‐6.  Seed treatment with T. viride 4g/kg or thiram/captan 3g/kg seed. Alternaria Blight (Alternaria ricini (Yoshii) Hansford) Light brown circular spots appear on cotyledonary leaves and irregular spots with concentric rings surrounded by yellow halos appear on mature leaves. Spots coalesce and cause foliage blight. Immature capsules wilt suddenly turn brown and due to collapse of pedicel fall or hang down. Sunken spots develop on mature capsules and gradually enlarge to cover the whole capsule with black sooty fungal growth.  Seed treatment with thiram/captan 2‐3 g/kg seed.  Spray manocozeb 2.5g/l or copper oxychloride 3g/l 2‐3 times at 15 day interval starting from 90 days of crop growth. Cercospora leaf spot (Cercospora ricinella Sace.) Minute circular to angular pale yellow watery lesions with pale green halo appear on the mature leaves which later turn into circular to irregular in shape with dark brown borders and greyish‐white centres. The fructifications of the fungus are visible as tiny black dots in the white cen‐tral region. When the spots coalesce, the intervening leaf tissue withers and large brown patches of dried leaf result.  Teat the seeds with thiram/captan 3g/kg seed.  Need based sprays of copper oxychloride 0.3% or mancozeb 0.25% two to three times at 10‐15 days interval. Bacterial leaf spot (Xanthomonas compestris Pv.ricini Yos. & Tak) Circular water soaked spots with pale green center and dark margin appear on the leaves, which later become angular and turn dark brown. Leaves become brittle and dry up. Dark elongated lesions develop on stem and petioles.  Remove and destroy infected crop debris.  Hot water seed treatment at 50‐60 0C for 10 min.  Spray streptocycline 1g/ 10 l of water or a combination of paushamycin 0.025% + copper oxychloride 0.3%. www.icar.org.in 26 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science Powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica (Lev) Arm) Leaves turn pale yellow with whitish superficial powdery masses on the under surface. Light green patches corresponding to diseased areas on the under surface are visible on the upper side when the leaves held against light. Leaves turn brown and drop off prematurely.  Spray wettable sulphur 0.2% twice at 15 days interval starting from 3 months after sowing. Grey rot/grey mould (Botrytis ricini Godfrey) Initially pale the blotch‐like spots are formed on capsules/flowers from which drops of yellow liquid exude. Later fungal threads grow from these spots and transform into dense wooly growth. The growth may vary from pale to olive grey in colour. Severely infected capsules rot and fall. The immature seeds become soft and mature ones hollow, exhibiting discoloured seed coat. Black sclerotia develop on infected seeds. Circular to sub‐circular or irregular lesions develop on leaves. Water soaked blackish lesions develop on tender shoots usually when infected spikes fall on them leading to rot and breakage.
