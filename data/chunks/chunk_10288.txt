 Transgenic chicken as bioreactor for production of human interferon alpha 2b in eggs At ICAR-DPR, Hyderabad, the transgenic cassette was transferred to the chicken genome through sperm mediated gene transfer (SMGT) method. A total of 4 transgenic birds (2 female and 2 male birds) were produced, where the efficiency of production of transgenic birds has been 5.4%. Transgenic birds lay eggs containing human interferon alpha 2b. Around 40-50 mg human interferon alpha 2b was isolated from each egg. The interferon alpha was found to be glycosylated indicating the biological activity and also showed its antimicrobial activity in HEK293 cell culture.

The body weight at 6 weeks of age was enhanced by 26.9% in knock down chicken (Bhattacharya et al. 2016). Further, to minimize cholesterol contents in egg and serum, RNAi approach was adopted to knock down Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA) and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1) genes. shRNA constructs were developed at ICAR-DPR, Hyderabad, which showed lower level of ACACA and SREBP1 protein in serum of the knock down birds. The inheritance of shRNA constructs was also analysed through back crossing. The serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were significantly lower by 26.8 and 31.3%, and 56.3 and 26.4%, respectively in ACACA and SREBP1 knock down birds compared to the control birds. The egg total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol content was significantly lower in both ACACA and SREBP1 knock down birds by 14.3 and 13.2%, and 10.3 and 13.6%, respectively compared to the control birds (Prasad et al. 2022). 5.1.3. Genome edited Nicobari chicken developed by CRISPR/Cas improves egg production Exon-1 and exon-2 of Inhibin alpha gene has been edited by CRISPR/Cas in Nicobari indigenous chicken breed. The efficiency of production of transgenic birds were 21.7 and 7.6% for exon-1 and exon-2, respectively while the efficiency of production of inhibin alpha edited birds was 13% for exon-1 fragment. The egg production upto 72 weeks of age was significantly higher by 95.3% in edited birds as compared to the control birds (250 vs 128 eggs). The number of pause days was lower in the edited birds as compared to the control birds (100.5 vs 224 days) indicating higher persistency of egg production in edited birds compared to that of control ones (0.7 vs 0.4 eggs/day). Internal egg quality parameters like Haugh unit and yolk colour index were higher by 19.8 and 17.5%, respectively in the edited birds compared to control. 5.1.4. Genomic Selection National Bovine Genomic Centre (NBGC) at ICAR-NBAGR Karnal has been launched in 2017 for implementing genomic selection (GS) in indigenous cattle using high throughput sequencing data. The accuracy of genomic prediction in dairy cattle exceeds 0.
