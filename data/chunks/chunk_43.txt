 The dwarf varieties of rice are characterized by the accumulation of substantial amounts of biomass, which after harvest as crop residue presents a challenge that extends beyond the fields. The management of rice residue has emerged as a critical facet in the quest for sustainable agriculture, particularly in the context of in-situ practices. According to estimates about 300 million tonnes of crop residue is produced annually in rice-wheat cropping system in India. Rice residue, comprised of straw and remnants left after harvesting, has historically been viewed as a by- product, often disposed of through burning or other conventional methods. The conventional approach, while providing a quick solution for field clearing, has raised environmental concerns, contributing to air pollution, nutrient loss, and alterations in soil parameters. In response to these challenges, the paradigm is shifting towards the in-situ management of rice residue as Indian Farming 74 (03): 17-20; March 2024 a strategic avenue for promoting both agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition that rice residue, far from being a waste material, holds untapped potential as a valuable resource for the enhancement of soil health. The shift towards in situ management entails practices like surface mulching or incorporating residue into the soil, aiming to maximize the positive impacts on soil structure, nutrient content, and overall sustainability. However, understanding the nuanced effects of these practices on soil health is essential to strike the delicate balance between agricultural productivity and environmental preservation.

Over the years, the paradigm shift has been utilized for in-situ rice residue management with its impact on soil health and sustainability of the production system. Recognizing rice residue as a valuable resource, in-situ practices like surface mulching and incorporation into soil are explored for enhanced productivity and environmental sustainability. Investigating nutrient cycling, microbial dynamics, and physicochemical properties, the delicate balance between productivity and preservation is highlighted.
