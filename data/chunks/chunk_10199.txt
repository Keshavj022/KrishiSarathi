 He also initiated the systems of long-range forecasting of rainfall in India. Though the first solar observation was made at Dehradun in 1878, the systematic recording of solar radiation started in 1893, when the Government of India sanctioned the first solar physics observatory at Kodaikanal in Palani hills in Tamil Nadu. India became the full member of the International Meteorological Orga- nisation in 1878 and in the same year, India Daily Weather Report (IDWR) started publishing from Shimla (IMD 1976). Madras Observatory (Source: IMD) Natural Resource Management in Pre-independent India 59 The country realized the need for seasonal forecast of rainfall, which was issued first by IMD on 4th June 1886. This made India the first country to start systematic development in long range forecasting (LRF). In 1889, John Eliot, was appointed as first Director General of Observatories of IMD at Calcutta. He was well known for improving the LRF of monsoon rains along with Gilbert Walker (IMD 1976). Upper air measurements started in India in 1905 using tracking balloons with theodolite, followed by routine observations from pilot balloon in 1913 (Katz 2002). In 1909, Walker developed multiple regression models for forecasting monsoon rainfall over India. In 1924, he discovered the ‘Walker Circulation’ and ‘Southern Oscillation’ and established the link between the Indian monsoon with global meteorological phenomenon (Adamson 2020). In 1928, with an objective to undertake monsoon research with improved facilities, IMD headquarters was established in Pune and in the same year the sounding balloon ascents commenced in India from Pune, which is considered as start of an important research area to study the vertical profile of the atmosphere. K.R. Ramanathan published the diagram of the distribution of upper atmospheric distribution over the globe in 1928, and in 1930 he published “discussion of results of sounding balloon ascents”. In 1931, P.R. Krishna Rao published “distribution of temperature in lower stratosphere”. In 1932, L.A. Ramdas studied the horizontal and vertical climatic variations near the ground surface (Ramdas and Malurkar 1932). The agricultural meteorology branch of IMD also started functioning under his leadership in 1932, which was one of the earliest of its kind in the world. By 1933, India made significant improvements in manufacturing measurement devices for weather parameters and started the manufacture of Symon’s rain gauge, cup anemometer and wind vanes. In 1936, IMD published “Meteorology for airmen in India” for aviation sector. The advancements of upper air measurements continued to grow and in 1943, L.S. Mathur developed clock type (C-type) radiosonde and in the same year S.P. Venkateshwaran developed Fan type (F-type) radiosonde in India. This was followed by the historic event of the first radiosonde observations in India in 1943 and radio wind in 1949. In 1944, S.K. Banerjee became first Indian Director General of IMD.
