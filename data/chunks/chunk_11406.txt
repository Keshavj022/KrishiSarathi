 During winters, various fungal, bacterial, and parasitic diseases like fin rot, gill rot, EUS and argulosis may appear in the pond. Treat the pond with CIFAX @ 400 ml/acre just before the onset of winters. Also treated with potassium permanganate @1-2 kg/acre or limestone @ 50-100 kg/acre. Salt application @ 100 kg/acre also helps in protecting fish against disease in winters. Rabi Crop production Wheat Wheat requires well drained and clayey loam soil. However, good crop of wheat can be raised in sandy loam and black soil also. Itâ€™s sown when the average daily temperature falls to around 22-23 0C, which happen in last October to November. For medium sized grain varieties seed rate of 100 kg/ha, for bold seeded variety 125 kg/ha and for late sown seed rate of 125-150 kg/ ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 138 ha is recommended. Improved varieties are DBW-187 (Karan Vandana), DBW-222, 252, 47, HS 542 (Pusa Kiran), K 8804, Deva, Indra, Ujiyar, Gomti, Halna, Atal, Gangotri, Prasad, Naina, Unnat Halna, Mandakani, kalayan sona Laser land levelling is a precursor resource conservation technology that is a must for the proper land leveling and implementation which increase productivity and profitability. Zero tillage technology is direct sowing in untilled land which can save time and fuel energy at lower cost. Preparation of soil before sowing, one deep plough followed by 2-3 light ploughing and planking with 10-ton FYM and 120 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorus and 40 kg potash fertilizer sufficient for one ha. Seed sown in 4-5 cm inside the soil and spacing of 22.5 cm is considered optimum for irrigated timely sown wheat, for late sowing spacing is reduced to 15-18 cm. Seed treatment with carboxin (75 WP) @2.5 g/kg seed) or carbendazim (50 WP) @ 2.5 g/kg seed or tebuconazole (2DS) @ 1.25g/kg seed or a combination of a reduced dosage of carboxin (75 WP) @ 1.25g/kg seed and a bioaget fungus, Trichoderma viride @ 4 g/kg seed is recommended. Yellow rust, powdery mildew, brown rust, Karnal bunt and spot blotch may also be controlled with the foliar sprays of propiconazole @ 0.1% and termite prone areas, seed treatment with chlorpyriphos @ 0.9g a.i. /kg seed, be taken up for their management. Aphid control by Imidacloprid17.8 SL @ 100ml/ha as foliar spray when the population reaches more than 10 aphids per tiller or 5 aphids per ear head. Wheat sown under irrigated conditions requires 4 to 6 irrigations depending on the soil and weather conditions. If water is available for 2 irrigations, it should be applied at crown root initiation stage and boot leaf stage. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 139 Control of weed by isoproturon with 2,4-D or metsulfuron, or sulfosulfuron with metsulfuron can be applied at 30-35 DAS at sufficient soil moisture. Under irrigated conditions the yield may vary from 2.5 to 6.5 tonnes /ha. Barley The crop requires temperature around 12-150C during growing period and around 30 0C at maturity time.
