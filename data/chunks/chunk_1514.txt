 • Aquaculture in lowland areas: In certain low-lying rainfed areas, farmers integrate small-scale fish farming in water bodies or refuges, which improves Indian Farming 41 January 2025 nutrient cycling and provides an additional source of income. • Value-added activities: Small-scale value-added enterprises, like mushroom cultivation, sericulture, and beekeeping, complement IFS by enhancing income potential and diversifying production. IFS models for rainfed conditions IFS model for rainfed lowland Integrated Farming System (IFS) model for rainfed lowland conditions (1.0 ha) at Cuttack (Odisha), incorporated crop rotations (rice–green gram, rice– vegetables, and rice–rice), horticulture, fish and prawn in refuges, and fodder on bunds, covering 85% of the area and contributing 75% to the net income. Livestock, including 3 goats, 100 ducks, and 75 poultry birds, used 12% of the area and added 20% to income. Oyster mushroom farming on 3% of the area contributed an additional 5% to net income. Overall, the model provided a rice-equivalent yield of 25 tonnes/year, generating `1.5 lakh annually and creating 400 person- days of employment. IFS model for rainfed conditions of Maharashtra IFS model (1.0 ha) for rainfed areas of Akola, comprised crop systems such as cotton + pigeon pea (6:2)–sesame, soybean + pigeon pea (5:1), sorghum–wheat, soybean– chickpea, and cowpea–fenugreek, occupying 80% of the area and providing 26% of the income. Horticultural crops (custard apple and drumstick) on 10% of the land contributed 19% of the income. Livestock, comprising 12 goats, 25 poultry birds, and 5 rabbits, used another 10% and contributed 55% to income. Overall, this IFS model reached a soybean-equivalent yield of 51 tonnes annually, earning `0.67 lakh and creating 951 person- days of work. Similarly, at Solapur, a 0.8-ha rainfed model incorporating crops, livestock, and poultry along with improved crop varieties and nutrient management yielded 7,994 kg of sorghum equivalent, generating `1,37,874 in net income and 371 person- days of employment, yielding 12% higher returns than traditional farming. Rainfed IFS models for Bundelkhand region Two resource based and farmer specific IFS models (1.0 ha) i.e. a rainfed crop-based focusing on rainfed crops and water harvesting, and a rainfed livestock-based incorporating livestock, rainfed fodder, crops and water harvesting were developed by IGFRI, Jhansi. Among these two models, highest net return (`37,424) and B:C ratio (2.03) was observed in rainfed crop dominated IFS as compared to rainfed forage dominated IFS. Rainfed farmers in Bundelkhand, who earn `25,000 to `30,000 annually, could increase their income to `40,000 with these models. Rainfed IFS model for Gujarat By introducing improved crop varieties, nutrient management, in-situ moisture conservation, livestock mineral supplementation, and napier grass cultivation on bunds in rainfed IFS model (1.76 ha) at Banaskantha (Gujarat), productivity increased by 18.
