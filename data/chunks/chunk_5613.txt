The presence of free water in the soil is injurious to plant life. The presence of excess moisture in the soil is reflected by the growth of weeds and by the sick appearance of the growing crops. If free water comes into direct contact with the plant stems, the plants may start rotting. In the hill areas, the drainage of surplus water takes place through the streams and along the slope. In the crops that are very sensitive to the presence of free water in the soil, the clearance of water is affected through shallow drains. The drains are made at an angle across the slope to prevent erosion and to offer a quick means of escape to the surplus water. The depth of the drains should not exceed 1 foot (30 cm) unless the soil is clayey.
