 Also, both the cropping systems differed in KL mainly on account of K0 as the value of KX was exactly same. Specifically held K values were observed to be prominently low in case of SDI than flooding method of irrigation. 3.2.7. Potential buffering capacity (PBCK) Across the scenarios, significant variation in PBCK was observed. The PBCK of soil under different management practices ranged from 36.4% to 64.1% (Table 2). It is a very important parameter suggesting the soil’s ability to buffer a given amount of available K over long term. Higher values of PBCK were found in soil under full CA based management practices (1.35 times higher) as compared to conventional tillage (Sc1). Scenario 2 also recorded lower value of PBCK than full CA based sce­ narios. The value of PBCK was in the order of Sc5 >Sc3 >Sc6 >Sc4 >Sc1 >Sc2. Higher values of PBCK indicate better and sustained availability of K to crops and thus less need for K fertil­ ization. Mean value of both the irrigation methods under full CA were also comparable suggesting that method of irrigation were not respon­ sible for variability in PBCK values (Table 2). However, cropping systems did present prominent difference in PBCK with rice-wheat cropping system having higher PBCK than maize-wheat cropping system.

K. Rani et al. Soil & Tillage Research 228 (2023) 105644 7 3.2.8. Potassium potential This parameter takes into account both the planar K and PBCK. The highest value was recorded in Sc6 (6.6 cmol kg−1 (mol L−1) −1/2) whereas the lowest was associated with Sc1 (1.63 cmol kg−1 (mol L−1) −1/2) (Table 2). The results indicate better K potential in all CA based scenarios as compared to CT plot without residue retention (Sc1). Be­ tween partial CA (Sc2) and full CA based scenarios, full CA based sce­ narios were able to maintain higher K potential. Between the two cropping systems, both were at par. Sub surface drip irrigation method was found relatively better than flooding method with respect to K potential. 3.2.9. Potassium free energy (-ΔG◦) The value of free energy for K exchange ranged from − 3375 cal mol−1 to − 4064 cal mol−1 (Table 2).
