 It saved 40% cost and 96% labour when compared with manual method of harvesting. Hill farming needs versatile agricultural machinery, which should be light in weight for transportation in hilly areas and portable. So a light-weight multi-crop thresher was developed for threshing wheat, paddy, minor millets, and amaranth crops commonly grown in Uttarakhand hills. The multi-crop thresher would benefit hill farmers by saving time and labour and reducing the drudgery involved in the traditional/ manual threshing operations. A tractor-operated drainage trencher for laying sub-surface pipes was developed and evaluated. The developed trencher can make the trench up to the depth of 1.0–1.1 m with width of 150– 160 mm. The cost of the trencher was ` 3,00,000 and cost of operation is about ` 1,300/h. The climate smart machinery such as roto-till-drill, broad-bed and furrow planters, laser land leveller, ridge and furrow planter and mole drainage technology were identified to overcome the adverse effect of climate change and degrading natural resources. The total input energy in wheat production after adopting roto-till drill (21.1 GJ/ha) is about 39% lower as compared to conventional practices (34.9 GJ/ha). The carbon emission in roto-till drill is 1,670 kg of equivalent C/ha which is 9% less as compared to conventional practice (1,834 kg of equivalent C/ha). A tractor-operated multi-row paper-tape vegetable transplanter was developed to save on labour, time and cost of vegetable production. It is a 6-row transplanting machine mounted on 3-point linkage of tractor. The field capacity of the transplanter was 0.25 ha/h and fuel consumption of 2.8 l/h. A battery-operated pruner for horticultural crops was developed. The device was tested on ber, guava, wax apple and mango. The cost of machine is ` 2,625 and operation cost is ` 39.48/h. A pollinator for greenhouse was designed on the principle of a pulsating air jet for pollination. The highest pollination efficiency (83.66%) was achieved at 1.99 m3/min airflow rate, 23.50 Hz pulsation frequency and exposure time 19.40 sec. The yield was higher with developed pollinator compared to pollination by a blower (36.6%) and controlled plot (95.7%). The bullock powered, rotary mode driven feed type sunflower thresher has been developed. The average output of the thresher was 65 kg/h with efficiency of threshing as 99% and cleaning 85%. Solar-assisted e-prime mover was developed for weeding and spraying in soybean crop. A three-cylinder tractor diesel engine was modified to run using 100% compressed natural gas (CNG). The engine was successfully operated using 100% CNG under no load condition. Pusa-Farm Sun Fridge for storage of perishables, can be built by farmers from locally available materials and does not need electrical supply or batteries for cooling. The structure of size 3×3×3 m and 2 tonnes capacity uses 12 solar panels @ 415 W each.
