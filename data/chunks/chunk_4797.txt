 When shrinking of bael fruits appear? The shrinking is observed in January-February months on fully mature fruits when the night temperature is low, i.e. < 110C (Table 2.). In variety NB-5 (Narendra Bael-5), it was reported in more than 30% of trees. The incidence was also observed in some other varieties but its intensity is <10% of trees planted. Sometimes diseased fruits shrink due to late infection, become black, light in weight, mummified, and remain hanging with stalks for Table 2.

Possible reasons of shrinkage of fruits The possible reason for this new emerging problem is the non-availability of assimilated supply, and water shortage to the fruit-bearing branch which may be attributed to clogging of xylem, as this problem was emerged mainly in that branch which faced cold stress or frost affected twigs. The leaves and twigs become dry and show senescence completely after cessation of winter. The expansion and contraction of fruits appeared to be a function of the degree of water deficit in the fruits in different atmospheric conditions. The night temperature was hovering around 3.92-10.150C with clear sky during January-February could be another reason for frost damage in the tree and shrinkage of fruits (Table 2). Thus, this malady needs to be addressed as NB-5 is the most popular variety of bael in northern India and orchardists are losing considerable price, they could fetch. A breeding program could be initiated for this variety to improve Narendra Bael-5 having high yield potential and better qualitative characters and free from this disorders. The development of integrated crop management strategies for sustainable fruit production of bael and bael-based cropping systems/cropping models should be developed to provide income stability to the farmers who grow NB-5.
