 By celebrating these successes and sharing their lessons, we can inspire more farmers to embrace the principles of natural farming and contribute to building a healthier, more vibrant planet for generations to come. *Corresponding author email: srksingh.icar@gmail.com Restoring soil health in Chhattisgarh Deepak Kumar, a farmer from Chhattisgarh’s Bhatapara district, embarked on a transformative journey into natural farming during 2022-2023. Guided by the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in Baloda Bazar (Balod), Deepak implemented a comprehensive set of farming practices on his two hectare landholding. His interventions included the application of various natural inputs like beejamrit, ghanjeewamrit, jeewamrit, mulching, and plant protection methods using neemashtra, agniashtra, brahmashtra, and mixed leaf extracts. Focusing particularly on Chickpea variety RVG-202, covering 0.40 hectares, Deepak achieved a production yield of 4.76 quintals. Deepak’s venture into natural farming not only resulted in a healthy crop but also reflected positively on the economic performance of his farm. The adoption of these practices led to a lower cost of cultivation compared to conventional farming methods, reducing operational expenses significantly. Despite a slightly lower yield, the net income increased notably, alongside a favourable benefit-cost ratio. His success highlights the viability and sustainability of natural farming practices, bringing economic benefits while contributing to soil health and organic matter improvement. With a commitment to continue natural farming with the support of KVK, Deepak’s experience stands as an inspiring model for fellow farmers seeking cost-effective and environmentally friendly agricultural solutions.
