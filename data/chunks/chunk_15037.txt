 Farm inputs are measured using indicators for the purchase of HYV seeds, irrigation (pumps, storage tanks, water), organic manure, chemical fertilizers and the number of labor-days utilized per cultivated acre, broken down into 3 categories ‚Äî total, hired and family. As farm inputs are likely jointly determined, I allow for correlation between the regressions by estimating the system of equations jointly using seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR). 27 I explore impacts of improvements in road infrastructure on landholdings in Appendix Table B5. I document no significant change in the total amount of land owned (column 2), a decline in the total amount of land leased out (column 3), and no change in the gross amount of land cultivated (column 4) by households that gain improvements in road connectivity in villages further away from towns. Further, I find no significant changes in landholdings for households that gain improvements in road connectivity in villages close to towns. Journal of Development Economics 152 (2021) 102686 11 Y.

(8), restricting attention to ùõø1, the treatment effect on households further away from towns. Outcome in Columns (1)‚Äì(2) is an indicator that equals 1 if the household engages in cultivation of non-cereal and cereal crops, respectively. Outcome in Column (3) is the share of gross land cultivated under non-cereal crops. Outcome in Columns (4)‚Äì(5) is an indicator that equals 1 if the household uses high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of non-cereal and cereal crops, respectively. Cereal crops include paddy, wheat, maize, jawar, bajra, ragi and barley; non-cereal crops include fruits and vegetables, pulses, oilseeds, fiber crops, sugarcane, spices, drugs and plantation crops. The regression in Column (3) is conditional on households that are cultivating some land in both periods. Observations are weighted using 1999 sample weights. Standard errors, clustered at the village level, are reported in parentheses. *ùëù< 0.10, **ùëù< 0.05, ***ùëù< 0.01. Table 5 Farm inputs.
