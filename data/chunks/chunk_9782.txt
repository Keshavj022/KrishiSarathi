 Maximum of 22 rabi sorghum varieties followed by 6 sweet sorghum varieties, 7 kharif sorghum varieties, 1 kharif sorghum hybrid, 5 single-cut forage varieties, one each of sweet sorghum variety, sweet sorghum hybrid and dual-purpose varieties, 3 specialty sorghum contributed to the trials. Distribution A total of 1,21,077 accessions were distributed to the bonafide users in the country and 1,079 MTAs were signed for supplying the germplasm. A maximum of 24,827 accessions were distributed to the bonafied users during 2012–13 followed by 17,981 in 2021–22. A maximum frequency of 17,000 accessions of millets germplasm were distributed and utilized for salinity and drought tolerant screening at Gujarat/Rajasthan followed by 7,500 accessions for screening leaf blast, neck blast and finger blast, and 6,160 accessions of germplasm were evaluated for yield attributing traits. Submission to National Genebank A total of 29,508 accessions were submitted to the national Genebank for long-term storage during 2000– 2021. A maximum of 4,179 accessions were submitted during 2016–2017 followed by 2,963 during 2020–2021. Genetic stocks registration with ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi A total of 112 millets genetic stocks were registered with ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi during 2002–2022. A maximum of 84 accessions of sorghum genetic stocks were registered followed by finger millet (19), barnyard millet (4), foxtail millet (3) and little millet (2). Table 1.

SUMMARY India being the primary origin for little millet, kodo millet and barnyard millet; secondary origin for sorghum and finger millet occupied the semi-arid regions, the adaptation, and diversity of these millets’ germplasm are exclusive to India for some extent. There is a necessity for re-introduction of millets local landraces in the region of collections to rejuvenate their natural habitat.
