 And out of 82 honey samples analysed, residues of HCH, Endosulfan, DDT, Chlorthalonil and Cypermethrin were detected in 51% samples. Out of 47 samples of processed food, 29% samples were contaminated with HCH, Malathion, Chlorpyriphos, Cypermethrin and DDT. CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 51 WHITE-GRUB MANAGEMENT Groundnut Among the new seed dressers for groundnut protection from white-grubs, Imidacloprid 200 SL (0.6 g a.i./kg seed) and Chlorpyriphos+Cypermethrin (5 g a.i./kg seed) have been found as effective as the presently recommended Chlorpyriphos for the last 3 years. Fipronil 5 FS (100 g a.i./ha) tested for the first time has also showed promise. On 3 years data, B : C ratio of Imidacloprid was 15.74 and of Chlorpyriphos + Cypermethrin was 19.45 as compared to about 22.00 of Chlorpyriphos and Quinalphos. Imidacloprid 200 SL at 60 g a.i./ha and Fipronil 5 FS at 150 g a.i./ha were found better than existing Chlorpyriphos 20 EC (at 800 g a.i./ha) and were at a par with Quinalphos 20 AF (at 800 g a.i./ha), when applied 21 days after mass emergence of beetles in the standing crop of groundnut. On 3 years data, highest B : C ratio of 13.68 was with Imidacloprid 200 SL, as compared to 9.8 by Chlorpyriphos and 9.06 by Quinalphos. Arecanut Arecanut white-grub Leucopholis lepidophora, with a two-year life-cycle and overlapping generations, can be effectively managed by each of Chlorpyriphos 10G or Phorate 10G or Carbofuran 10G or Chlorpyriphos 10G (25 g/palm) and Chlorpyriphos 20 EC at 6 ml/palm. NEMATODE MANAGEMENT Rice. White-tip disease intensity, caused by white-tip nematode (Aphelenchoides besseyi), reduced significantly by soaking paddy seeds in Carbosulfan (0.1%) for 6 hours, followed by foliar spray of Carbosulfan (0.2%) at 40 DAT. Pulses. In pigeonpea, when Pseudomonas fluorescens was combined with Trichoderma viride at 2.5 kg/ha for managing pigeonpea-cyst nematode wilt complex, the nematode population reduced and yield of the crop increased up to 43.8%. Root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) management in chickpea with Carbosulfan 25 EC at 0.1% a.i. led to an increase of 23% in yield over control with a cost: benefit ratio of 1 : 3. Vegetables. Hisar Lalit, a tomato-variety resistant against root-knot nematode when transplanted in solarized field showed reduced root-knot index. Sweet-potato Sree Bhadra when intercropped with brinjal or okra reduced root-knot nematode population and generated cost : benefit ratio of 1 : 1.27. Nursery treatment with Carbofuran 3G at 0.3 g/m2 and seedling root-dip treatment with Carbosulfan 25 EC at 0.05% for 6 hours for brinjal and seed treatment with Carbosulfan 25 ST at 3% w/w for bittergourd significantly reduced various nematodes. Fibre crops. In cotton, seed treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens at 20g/kg seed and soil application at 10 g/pot proved best in controlling reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis). Neem-cake at 1,000 kg/ha and soil drench with Mancozeb 80% WP at 0.
