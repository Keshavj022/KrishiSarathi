 At present, these varieties are under cultivation in large areas by progressive farmers and cooperative groups located in Darbhanga, Purnea, Madhubani, Katihar, and Sitamarhi) of Bihar and gaining valuable experience in its cultivation.

The upper surface of leaves is green and lower side is purple with 0.90 to 1.5 m long petiole. It is normally grown in tropical and subtropical climates in stagnant water of 0.2-2 m depth. It requires temperature in the range of 20 to 35°C; relative humidity of 50- 90% and annual rainfall of 100-250 cm for proper growth and development with water transparency of 50%. March 2024 4] Indian Farming 42 March 2024 Crop cultivation • Pond system: It is very old method of cultivation maintaining water depth of 1.5-2 m. There is no need of seed sowing in old pond but in new pond, seeds are sown by broadcasting method @ 80 kg/ha during December-January. This system gives low yield and it is very tedious and cumbersome to harvest kernel from the bottom of the pond. It takes one year to complete the crop cycle. • Field/farming system: It is a modern method of makhana farming requiring less time and water maintaining 30-60 cm water depth. Intercropping is possible with fodder in same year. It requires nursery for raising 2-3 months seedlings having 4-5 leaves, light green in colour which are suitable for transplanting in main field at the spacing of 1.25 m × 1.25 m during 4th week of March- 1st week of April. Crop diversification can be made by growing different water crops like water chestnut, fish, particularly catfishes, sweet flag along with makhana cultivation. Integrated nutrient management Cultivating Makhana in the region requires slightly higher doses of micronutrients (copper and zinc) as Zn plays a crucial role in flowering, fruit growth and seed formation. The application of NPK and FYM, in combination, enhances the yield of Makhana. Makhana exhibits a favourable response to FYM application as compared to NPK fertilizers, hence right quantity (dose) of farmyard manure (FYM) is considered crucial as it also provides traces of micro-nutrients elements.
