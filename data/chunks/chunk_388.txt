Moreover, maturity of late sown mungbean crop may coincide with early monsoon rains leading to deterioration in grain quality and reduction in seed yield. Field preparation: Pre-sowing irrigation before tillage should be ensured for summer cultivation after the harvest of preceding crops followed by 2â€“3 ploughings and 1 planking are required to make the Indian Farming 11 November 2023 seedbed free from clods and weeds. Summer mung can also be grown without any preparatory tillage with the help of zero-till drill after the harvest of wheat crop if there is no wheat straw in the field. In case of combine-harvested wheat crop, summer mungbean can be sown by Happy Seeder even with remnant wheat straw. Crop geometry and seed rate: Seeds should be sown in lines 4-5 cm deep in a well-prepared seedbed in good moisture regime. The crop should be sown at row spacing of 30 cm with 10 cm plant- to-plant distance. The seed rate of 25 kg/ha is recommended in summer season to achieve an optimum plant population of mung crop.
