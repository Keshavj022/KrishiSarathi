At Tirupati also, Rangpur lime has been recommended as the most suitable rootstock for Sathgudi. • In acid lime plant spacing of 6 x 6m is ideal for superior quality fruit production having less pest and disease problem though the yield was less than 6 x 3m spacing. • Variety specific planting density has been developed for banana and sapota & is as under: BANANA Variety Planting Density Nendran 2 x 3m with 3 suckers/pit (5000 plants/ha) Robusta 1.8 x 3.6m with 3 suckers/pit (4630 plants/ha) Grand Naine 2 x 3m with 3 suckers/pit (5000 plants/ha) Basrai 2 x 3m with 3 suckers/pit (5000 plants/ha) Tellachakkerakeli, Malbhog and Rasthali 1.2 x 1.2 x 2 (5208 plants/ha) www.icar.org.in 75 2002‐2007 SAPOTA PKM‐1 sapota at Periyakulam 8x4m (312 plants/ha) Kalipatti at Kovvur 5.0 x 5.
