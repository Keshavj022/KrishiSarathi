 In the same line, a trial conducted by KVK Banka in which daily production of 75 kg hydroponic maize and wheat green fodders from 52.5 sq ft tray area was recorded. On day 14, 1.89 kg maize and 1.10 kg wheat green fodder/ ft2 area were harvested. The height of maize and wheat green fodders were 20-23 cm and 15-17 cm, respectively. Each kg of maize and wheat grains produced 5.7 kg and 4.4 kg fodder, respectively. The milk production of the dairy cattle was also increased by 5% and the cost of per kg milk production was reduced from `13.30 to `12.70. After feeding of hydroponic fodders, the animals became regular in heat after 2 months of parturition and most of the animals conceived in first or second oestrous cycle. An increment of net profit of `25.50/animal/day was recorded by the farm woman. The present case study may be a pathway for its large-scale adoption by the small holder farmers for sustainable dairy farming. Seventeen dairy farmers are following the low-cost hydroponic green fodder production and two automatic hydroponic system were installed at KVK banka and Uparama village of Banka district. SUMMARY Production of green fodder intercropping with potato, on bund of pond, mango orchard provides round the year green fodder to small and marginal farmer. Use of non-conventional green fodder was helpful in providing green fodder to marginal and landless farmers. Production of hydroponic fodder under low- cost management can be an alternative to traditional fodder production. *Corresponding author email: pragya.bhadauria@icar.gov.in Table 3.

However, palas (Butea monosperma) has new green leaves during this time. Hilly area of Katoria, Chanan, Belhar, Fullidumar and some part of Banka block of Banka district have forest of Palas (Butea monosperma). So, use of palas leave as green fodder may combat the deficit of green fodder during scarcity period. The feeding trial on palas leaf as green fodder was also performed under on farm trial (OFT) by the KVK Banka and it was found that palas leaf was Table 3.
