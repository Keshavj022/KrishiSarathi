 Typically, architecture is structured in a framework comprising three, four, and five layers (including the perception layer, connectivity layer, application layer, middleware, and processing layer) for smart agriculture applications. Table 3 shows the studies proposing, and validating the smart tools (IoT and WSN) for monitoring and supplying irrigation water to crops to enhance crop yield, WUE, and environmental footprints. Agriculture 2024, 14, 1141 27 of 40 Table 3. Different authors propose smart drip and sprinkler irrigation system tools.
