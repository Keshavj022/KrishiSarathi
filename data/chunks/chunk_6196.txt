86 mg/litre but in lime and banana juice treatments it varied from 32.83 ± 1.38 to 64.59 ± 12.24 mg/litre which was higher than that of control. A similar trend was observed both in indoor and outdoor experiments. The results, thus show that the lime and banana pseudostem juice increased the calcium concentration in water. Banerjea (1967) suggested that the pond with less concentration of available calcium both in soil and water will be less productive than others where calcium is abundant. Ammonium nitrogen Content of ammonium nitrogen showed slight oscillation during indoor experiment, and in general recorded higher values during initial period and decreased gradually as the experiment advanced (Tables 8a and 8b). The ammonium nitrogen values varied from 0.04 ± 0.024 to 0.4 ± 0.15 mg/litre irrespective of treatments. In outdoor experiment it varied from 0.061 ± 0.001 to 0.835 ± 0.129 mg/litre. Ammonium nitrogen concentration was more in outdoor experiment than in indoor experiment. It was found that mostly the concentration of ammonia was low (0.56 mg/ litre). Ellis et al. (1946) suggested that a concentration of more than 1 mg/litre NH4-N indicates pollution by organic matter. Unionized ammonia is highly toxic to fish, but the ammonium ion is relatively non-toxic (Boyd, 1982). Nitrate nitrogen Nitrate nitrogen is considered as one of the limiting nutrients because of its regulatory influence on organic production in aquatic environments and its low concentration available for utilization. Banerjee (1967) suggested that water having less than 0.1 ppm nitrate is Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Table 7a.

In the present investigation, irrespective of treatments, the nitrate nitrogen values varied from 0.002 ± 0.0001 to 0.025 ± 0.008 mg/litre in outdoor experiment (Table 9). This water was not much productive in the experiment. However, nitrate-nitrogen value was slightly more in T1, the treatment where juice of banana pseudostem was used @ 0.5 ml/litre. The trend Contents FISHERY Table 9. Nitrate nitrogen content of water (mean ± S.D. in mg/litre) during outdoor experiment observed in all the treatment, was the gradual decrease of nitrate nitrogen as the experiment advanced. This might be due to fact that fertilization was done at the beginning of the experiment only.
