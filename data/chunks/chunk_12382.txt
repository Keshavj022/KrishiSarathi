 There is no government scheme accessible to farmers of Delhi and ATMA scheme is also not being implemented. Unlike rest of the country, there is no subsidy on electricity rates and electricity connections to the farm sector. In fact farmers could not get electricity from the private producers due to non-lucrative profit the farming sector offers. Inadequacy in land law regarding land leasing has led to reduced interest among farmers in long term investment in land that could have positive effect on production and productivity. Private players with vested interest are the only source of agri-inputs because no government shop is there for them. For assessing the farmers’ needs and requirements for doubling farmers’ income in coming five years, a farmer-scientist meet was convened on July 25, 2017. The outcomes of the meet are as follows: Issues and opinions raised by the farmers:   The share of agriculture in the economy of Delhi is small and that is not allowing the Government to consider Delhi as an agricultural state, as per definition, which in turn is not allowing the Delhi farmers to take benefits of various agricultural schemes.   No government schemes are available to the farmers related to agriculture especially crop insurance scheme, micro-irrigation, protected agriculture etc.   No subsidy in electricity rate is available to the farmers. Electricity rates for allied activities e.g. mushroom cultivation, fisheries production and nursery raising etc. are very high. As such enterprises are considered as a commercial activity.   Farmers are not eligible to get bank loans for agricultural expenses. State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 115   Problems of blue bull that destroys pulse crop thoroughly could not be tackled as there is no permission at least to erect fences or boundary walls.   ATMA is not functioning in Delhi. Hence, farmers are not getting opportunities to participate in capacity building activities.   The linkage between farmers and agriculture department is deficient.   Farmers are interested in organic farming of vegetables but the certification procedure (which is essential for getting the premium price of organic produces) is painfully lengthy and very costly.   Soil and water testing facilities are not readily available to the farmers for past several decades. They are not getting gypsum for soil amendment either.   Lots of farmers are maintaining apiary but the price of honey is not remunerative. Farmers suggested MSP to be fixed for honey. The farmers suggested the following remedial measures for their professional hardships:   Delhi state need to be declared as agricultural state.   Dedicated outlets for sale of farmers produces should be there in different localities of urban areas of Delhi.   Timely delivery of information related to agricultural schemes, organic certification and new technologies should be provided as least block-wise.
