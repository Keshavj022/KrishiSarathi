 Six leaf-rust resistant genes Lr2a, Lr2b, Lr2c, Lr15, Lr22 and Lr39 are also present on 2DS chromosome at different locations than of LrLWH. These 2DS Lr genes were also evaluated against an array of leaf -rust pathotypes. Lr39 was found resistant to all Indian leaf- rust pathotypes while LrLWH was susceptible to point 5R9-7 only. Based on the genomic location and phenotypic data, LrLWH has been concluded to be a new leaf-rust resistance gene flanked by DNA markers tightly linked to LrLWH, and can be utilized for selection of resistance to wheat leaf rust in wheat-lines.
