 The soils of the arid zones are sandy and light, and significant soil losses occurs due to high wind velocity particularly Indian Farming 73 (11): 06-08; November 2023 in summer season. Under such situation, this rhizomatous species provides protection to soils from wind erosion. Mostly, the varieties of this species have well developed root rhizomatous system. In view of increasing animal population and to fulfill the future fodder requirement, variety CAZRI Anjan 2178 with high green and dry matter yield was released in 2018 for Rajasthan vide notification no. S.O. 1379 (E), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmersâ€™ Welfare, dated 27-03- 2018. It is suitable for cultivation in Rajasthan. CAZRI Anjan 2178 variety is a selection from western Rajasthan made during 1995. Its plants are erect with profuse tiller production and branching, luxuriant growth and medium tall plants (82 cm). It has abundance of yellowish green foliage with medium long leaves and medium leaf: stem ratio (1.22). It is a thin stemmed variety. Its node pigmentation is purple, fresh stigma colour is pink and spike colour at maturity is purple. Days to 50% flowering ranges between 23- 25 days and seeds mature between 35-45 days. Target areas for cultivation The variety is released for Rajasthan, however it can also be grown in low rainfall areas under rainfed conditions. Tested in North West Zone at Jodhpur, Bikaner, Avikanagar and Jalore under rainfed conditions, it is suitable for the state. Normally dry sowing is done in rows with 5 kg seeds per hectare at row spacing of 70 cm preferably prior to onset of monsoon. However, recent studies have shown that wider row spacing is more effective row spacing in arid areas which saves seeds, reduces cost of cultivation and increases the age of the sward. Fodder yield: In varietal trials, on an average, its green fodder yield was 108.4 q/ha, 15-33% more than the yields of two checks CAZRI 75 (94.1 q/ha) and IGFRI 3108 (81.2 q/ha). It also yielded high dry matter (38.4 q/ ha), 82% more than IGFRI 3108 (21.1 q/ha). Frequency in a group of top three varieties was higher (4/5; 80%) Indian Farming 7 November 2023 Table 1.
