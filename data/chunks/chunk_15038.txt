 I run the pooled regression in Eq. (8), restricting attention to 𝛿1, the treatment effect on households further away from towns. Outcome in Columns (1)–(4) is an indicator that equals 1 if the household purchases high-yielding variety (HYV) seeds, irrigation, organic manure and chemical fertilizer respectively. Outcome in Column (5) is the total number of labor-days per cultivated acre. Outcome in Column (6) is the total number of hired labor-days per cultivated acre. Outcome in Column (7) is the total number of family labor-days per cultivated acre. The regressions in Columns (5)–(7) are conditional on households that are cultivating some land in both periods. Observations are weighted using 1999 sample weights. Standard errors, clustered at the village level, are reported in parentheses. *𝑝< 0.10, **𝑝< 0.05, ***𝑝< 0.01. I find a significant increase in households’ take up of material inputs (columns 1–4).28 Further, I find substantial expansion of farm labor use, with a 49 percent increase in the total number of labor-days invested per acre of cultivated land, significant at the 1 percent level (column 5). This is driven by a 54 percent increase in the number of labor-days hired per acre of cultivated land (column 6). While I observe an increase in the number of family labor-days employed per acre of cultivated land, this effect is imprecisely estimated (column 7).29 This suggests that households are not substituting between hired labor and family labor, but instead, increasing investments in both categories. Given strong complementarities between high-yielding va- riety seeds and other inputs of production30 (Duflo and Pande, 2007; Foster and Rosenzweig, 2010; Suri, 2011), these results are consistent 28 I also examine the impact of improvements in rural road infrastructure on an indicator for the purchase of mechanized farm equipment (trac- tors/harvesters/threshers). I find no detectable impact along this margin. This result is consistent with Asher and Novosad (2020) who find no change in ownership of mechanized farm equipment in villages that received PMGSY roads. 29 Appendix Table B6 summarize the treatment effects of improved rural road infrastructure on households’ farm input decisions (columns 4 to 8) for the direct (panel A) and incidental (panel B) connections respectively. 30 Previous work has documented that high-yielding varieties are more sensi- tive to modern inputs such as chemical fertilizers, as well as traditional inputs such as water. Transplanting, fertilizer and manure application, weeding, and irrigation system management are all labor-intensive processes. Further, as yields are typically higher, the adoption of high-yielding varieties is also associated with an increased demand for labor during harvests. Appendix Table B8 breaks down farm labor use by agricultural operation.
