It also recorded 1.5 to 39% high per day green fodder production (2.03 q/ha/day) over checks CAZRI 75 (2.0 q/ha/day) and IGFRI 3108 (1.46 q/ha/day). Maximum green fodder yield of the variety recorded was 210.8 q/ha, 14.8% more than the best check CAZRI 75 (183.7 q/h) in 2005. It consistently had more green forage production than both the checks. Percent increase was up to 51.2% high over the checks in different years of testing. Only in 2006, reduced green forage yield (-6.5%) was recorded than the best check IGFRI 3108. Maximum mean dry matter production in the variety was 67.3 q ha, 4.0% more than the best check CAZRI 75 (64.7 q/ha) recorded in 2005. Similar to green fodder, it consistently had more dry matter production than both the checks in all the years except CAZRI 75 in 2006. Percent increase in dry matter yield was up to 95.1% higher than IGFRI 3108 in 2005. Seed yield: Range grasses seeds are rare commodity and not easily available in open market. Poor physical quality (< 80%), low germination (<30%) and various adverse climatic conditions are the bottlenecks in the seed production of the grasses. From a well-managed seed plot, up to 80 kg seeds can be harvested from one hectare seed plot of the variety. At ICAR-CAZRI, Jodhpur, quality seed production of this variety is being undertaken in about 2.7 hectares. Other desirable traits: Plant height is more than CAZRI 75 (NC) and slightly less than IGFRI 3108 (NC). Due to thin stem, the variety is also suitable for small ruminants. In respect to fodder quality, variety CAZRI Anjan 2178 recorded 5.1% crude protein in varietal trials. Reaction to major diseases and insect pests The variety is free from major diseases and insect pests. Rarely, grass hopper may damage the crop. Need based use of insecticides is advised to manage these insects. Cenchrus ciliaris variety CAZRI Anjan 2178 at wider row (140 cm) spacing Seeds of variety CAZRI Anjan 2178 Spikes of variety CAZRI Anjan 2178 Indian Farming 8 November 2023 Economic benefits From one or more years old pastures, forage can be utilised in 2-3 weeks after the first effective showers during summer monsoon. In the normal rainfall, two to three cuts can be taken when harvested at right stage which is initiation of inflorescence to 50% flowering stage. From one hectare, around 40 quintals dry matter yield can be taken from these harvests. An amount of `24000 to 28000 can be realised from the Seed plot of CAZRI Anjan 2178 at wider row spacing (140 cm) sale of fodder or can be grazed in the fields. In the drier areas, well managed pastures give economic yield up to five years and in semi- arid areas, the age of the pasture is more than five years.
