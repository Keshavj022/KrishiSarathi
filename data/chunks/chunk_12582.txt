 High altitudes (Mao, Ukhrul): Tree beans+peach/pear+ kiwi vines+ginseng+potato seeds+ rice+peas+colecrops+piggs+pou ltry, etc. Mid altitudes (Senapati, Chandel, Kangpokpi, Tamenglong, Churachanpur): Tree beans+ rice+ peanuts+ soyabeans+ rice beans+ org. cucurbits +ginger/ turmeric+yams+colocasia, etc. Jhumlands: Rice+maize+beans+pigs+goats+chicks+fruits/trees+rapeseed+peas+potatoes+colocasia+tapio ca+ yams, etc. i. Important rice varieties that are locally developed and can be adopted by farmers in Manipur are RC Maniphou 7, RCManiphou 10, RC Maniphou 11, RC Maniphou 12 and CAU R1 and newly released varieties like RC Maniphou 13, CAU R2, CAUR3 and CAU R 4. ii. Revitalization of state cattle breeding policy for crossbreeding/grading up of local cows. iii. To solve fodder issues, identification and mapping of available land, feasibilities of fodder crops cultivation, both in valley and hill areas mainly, fallow foot hills are necessary for development of intensive fodder production activities. Dairy cooperative societies, farmers clubs, district councils, village level small milk production units may be entrusted to manage with available spaces for growing fodder by providing skill oriented managerial trainings and provision of inputs like fodder seeds, organic/chemical fertilizers and insecticides, pesticides, etc. iv. Strengthening of district level disease diagnostic lab. Local veterinary dispensaries and hospitals should be well equipped for timely management during adverse situations as well as facilities for mobile clinic round the clock to minimize any kind of health related emergencies. v. In poultry the state has a high shortage of poultry products, particularly eggs. High cost of production due to high cost of concentrate feeds, lack of scientific manpower, losses due to diseases are the constraints for ensuring a remunerative income to the poultry farmers. To minimize the cost of production low cost concentrate feed should be made available 367 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 to the poultry farmers. vi. To ensure higher income, rearing of low input-high output birds, like dual purpose breeds viz., Giriraja/ Vanaraja/Gramapriya/Kruoiler/ FFGN/Gramapariya/ Srinidhi/ CARI Shyama/Priya/ Nirbheek/Devendra/ Kamarupa, etc., may be encouraged. vii. Being the most important livestock for hills and valley areas, pig production may be prioritized for doubling the farmers income. For enhancing Piggery development in the state, more breeding farms for multiplication of piglets/pork production should be established under sustainable conditions with the expert guidance of breeding professional. viii. For doubling the household income, the ideal combinations of livestock would be to maintain i. 2-3 dairy cattle, 100 chick and 20-30 ducks in semi urban areas; ii. 2-3 dairy cattle, 3-4 pigs, 25 - 100chickens and 20 ducks in rural areas of valley; and iii.
