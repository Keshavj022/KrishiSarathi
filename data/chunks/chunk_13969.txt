GI is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the state product has a GI certiﬁcate that year. Coast is a dummy variable equal to one for all the coastal states and zero otherwise. Med_GIs is an interaction of the dummy variable equal to one for all states with the above-median number of GIs and zero otherwise, and the variable GI. State Product Event Trend is an event time vari- able equal to the difference between the year when GI is granted and the current year. Robust standard errors clustered at the state product level in parentheses. ***, **, and * denotes statistical signiﬁcance at 1%, 5%, and 10%, respectively.

Highway and rail denote (log of) length (in km) of highways and rail, respectively, per million persons in 2004. The pendency ratio is the share of cases pending trial in total cases for trial in courts within a state in 2004.
