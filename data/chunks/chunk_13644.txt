 Following this, the current study attempts to answer the following research questions: i) Is there any signiﬁcant role of institutional and behavioural factors in farmers’ decision to adopt SAPs? ii) If yes, then which particular factor needs to be prioritized by decision makers for improving the adoption of SAPs at ground by farming community? In line with this, we aim to assess the inﬂuence of institutional factors and behavioural factors manifesting in attitude and perception towards adoption of SAPs by farmers in Indian subcontinent. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study Region We conducted a ﬁeld survey of 400 farmers in the Buldhana and Parbhani districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra (Fig. 2). Vidarbha and Marathwada are agrarian economies with cotton, jowar, soybean, and pulses as the main crops. Vidarbha encompasses eleven districts with a 97,321 sq. Km. area, a GDP of around $ 21.9 billion, a population of 23 million, and is considered one of the most backward parts of Maharashtra (Vivek Prakash, 2016). These districts are experiencing high climate variability and agricultural vulnerability for the past three decades (Swami et al., 2018; Swami and Parthasarathy, 2021). Number of farmers' suicide rate is highest in Indian subcontinent, specially among Vidarbha and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra (Jadhav, 2019; Swami et al., 2020), depicting their vulnerability to climate extremes and water scarcity. Extreme drought, ﬂoods, farmers' indebtedness, poor socio-economic condition, and crop failure are plaguing Maharashtra's rural economy (Talule, 2018). Additionally, Vidarbha and Marathwada are water scarce regions as they are experi- encing an alarming dip in the ground water level (Kumar et al., 2023) and also exposed to high climate variability, with continuous increase in dry spells from past 1-2 decades (Swami et al., 2018). In this condition, use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides may further degrade the quality of soil and water in that region (Khetwani and Singh, 2018), thereby following sustainable form of agriculture by farmers is quintessential from pro- tecting the land area of Vidarbha and Marathwada from further degradation. Vidarbha experiences high climate variability and receives an annual rainfall of only 400–600 mm. The temperature of Vidarbha varies from 12 to 25 C to a maximum of 30–48 C with relative humidity in the range of 10–15% to 60–95% (Tiple et al., 2013). The soil of the Vidarbha region lacks micronutrients and is frequently attacked by pests and weed growth. These conditions increase farmers' risk and exposure, resulting in lesser productivity and poor income (Bhusari et al., 2016). Marathwada encompasses eight districts with a 64,590 sq. Km area, a GDP of around $ 13.8 billion, a population of around 18.7 million, and is considered one of the most impoverished regions of Maharashtra (Vivek Prakash, 2016).
