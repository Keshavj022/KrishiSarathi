Fisheries Breeding of ornamental and food fishes: Channa stewartii, commonly known as the Assamese snakehead or golden snakehead, is an indigenous ornamental fish. The species collected from beels of Assam were raised to broodstock in concrete tanks. Upon attaining maturity, the males (160–190 g) and females (250–300 g) were selected and kept in breeding tanks for natural spawning. After spawning, hatchlings were allowed to be with the parents as this fish exhibit parental care. After three weeks, the hatchlings (25–29 mm/0.18–0.29 g) were reared separately. Channa stewartii Silver moony, Monodactylus argenteus Silver moony, Monodactylus argenteus, is a brackish water ornamental fish, which can be adopted to freshwater.
