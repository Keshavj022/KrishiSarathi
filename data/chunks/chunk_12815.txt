 643 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Balanced and optimum use of fertilizers will be promoted together with use of organic manures and bio-fertilizers to optimize the efficiency of nutrient use. The concept of INM practices in rice, pulse, oilseeds production needs to be popularized. Use of organic manure in the soil would be the effective step in maintaining the health of the soil. Composting, vermicomposting, use of Farm Yard Manure, use of green manure crops, green leaf manuring etc., would be promoted as part of it. The availability of these types of natural organic manures is to be assured by employing effective mechanisms and logistic networks so that the organic content of the soil is increased to the level ideal for shifting towards ‘Organic Farming’ without affecting the returns. Amelioration of acidic soils through soil ameliorants to be undertaken and side by side acid tolerant crops are also to be included in the cropping system approach, where amelioration would not be profitable. Adequate and timely supply of fertilizers at reasonable rate to farmers shall be the endeavour of the Government. Farmers should be convinced for growing green manure crop and planting organic matter supplying trees on his land. Training on skill development is to be imparted for vermicompost preparation from manures of cattle, pigs, poultry and goat along with various sorts of crop/ vegetables refuse. 3. Technologies for conservation and management of natural resources   A database of the soils as well as water resources of West Bengal State is to be available to the farming community indicating the different characteristics of the soils, water resources and the crops suited for them with the corrective measures needed for introducing alternate crops. Farmers should get these details at their fingertip through the web and facilitated by Agricultural officer who is the grass root functionary of the system. The database on soils, water resources and the crops suited for the area along with technological modules should be at Panchayat level and treated as baseline for any agricultural development programmes.   Effective use of land and water is fundamental to growth and sustainable development. Soil and water conservation, agriculture development and allied activities like animal husbandry, pisciculture, etc, will be carried out in an integrated manner with a full involvement and participation of the farmers.   Water budgeting could be defined as ‘an estimate of harvest of water resources and its utilization for a set period of time’. The requirement of water in a watershed is assessed scientifically and a plan is to be made. The water available from rains, irrigation requirement, water holding capacity of the soil, irrigation frequency, method of irrigation, crop duration etc.
