45% of them use it, indicative of a lack of mechanization of farming activities in Odisha. Further, the socioeconomic composition of the sample households reveals that most of the respondents belong to the OBC category, 43.6% of the households belong to the BPL category and 86.8% of the house­ holds have formal electricity connections. Before the multinomial logit model was estimated, a test for the problem of multicollinearity was carried out for the independent variables. The result of the multi­ collinearity is presented in Table A.1 (Appendix). The result reveals that since the value of Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) of all the variables are below 10, we can conclude that the model is free from the problem of multicollinearity. The result of the multinomial logit models is presented in Table 7. The acceptable Pseudo R2 and significant χ2 for all the models represent the goodness of fit of the qualitative dependent variable models. The result reveals that land ownership exclusively by females raises their power of decision-making with respect to all agricultural activities in the household.
