 Extent of participation in urban agriculture in Ghana and India Extent of urban agriculture and food security 447 extent of UA participation in India. The result suggests that households who had had many yearsâ€™ experience in farming are more likely to intensify UA production compared to others with little or no farming experience. Also, a UA producer who (in both Ghana and India) is engaged in farming as a primary job is more likely to increase his/her extent of participation compared to the one who is not a farmer. The finding aligns with Smart et al. (2015), who reported that UA is increasingly becoming a source of livelihood for many urban dwellers due to job loss, economic downturn as well as the limited number of employment opportunities in the formal sector. Further, a household that rears animals is less likely to increase the extent of UA participation compared to others in Ghana. The negative association between the extent of UA participation and the rearing of animals could be attributed to the less size of land required for livestock activities compared to a crop or mixed farming (Yusuf et al., 2008). The results suggest that animal rearing could be one of the best ways to encourage UA among households since households do not need large spaces to rear animals. This is because, mostly, in urban areas of developing countries such as Ghana and India, agricultural lands are only available and remain so when it does not have alternative uses in urban areas. Further, in India, a household that does UA as a business is more likely to increase its extent of participation in UA compared to others. This holds true for most households involved in UA as they are more likely to sell products to generate income (Smart et al., 2015). Earlier studies in Ghana and India revealed that participation in UA is primarily driven by sales to gain income (Chaudhuri, 2015: Mackay, 2018). On health and nutrition factors, the fear of pesticides used in the production of agricultural products positively influences the extent of participation in UA in both Ghana and India. The result is not surprising because, in most developing countries like Ghana and India, studies have revealed that pesticides usage in vegetable production and marketing exceeds health thresholds (Amoah et al., 2006; Karanja et al., 2010) mainly because pesticides are viewed as the only option for pests and diseases control in agriculture production, especially, vegetables (Dapaah Opoku et al., 2020).
