However, if the area shifts from conventional to organic is conﬁned to only rainfed, hilly and tribal areas, then producer, consumer and total surplus to the economy will increase in all three crops. Overall, economy wide conversion to organic agriculture may not be economically viable, as soil fertility will reduce year after year without the application of fertilizers.

However, there is huge scope for expanding organic agriculture in rainfed areas. 3.8. Farmer’s Attitude toward Organic Farming This section assessed farmers’ attitudes toward organic farming based on the behav- ioral principles developed by Chetsumon and Wheeler [37,38]. The indicators were divided into ﬁve parts (Figure 7). About 46 percent of farmers said they adopted organic farming for health and food safety reasons. Reduction in the cost of production was the second reason for adopting organic farming. The role of agricultural ofﬁcers was important, as 32 percent of farmers mentioned that they shifted to organic farming due to advice from government agricultural ofﬁcers. The part of private companies was limited in encouraging organic farming, as only 12 percent responded positively, as most of the private companies are in the business of selling chemical fertilizers and pesticides. It was ascertained that the main problem while converting to organic farming was the lack of certiﬁcation (57 percent), resulting in no premium price. Figure 7.

Sustainability 2022, 14, 15057 15 of 22 Further, the scarcity of organic inputs and labor (particularly family labor) was another constraint, as organic agriculture is relatively more labor-intensive than conventional agriculture. Although lower costs attract farmers to adopt organic farming, they are hesitant to adopt it widely due to low yields, higher labor and supervision time requirements and lack of premium price [39–41]. Some farmers prefer organic agriculture to meet their own consumption needs.
