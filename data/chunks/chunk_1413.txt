 By choosing a flower with less competition and constant demand, Shri Srinivas was able to mitigate the risks associated with market fluctuations. With the support from FFP, Shri Srinivas began his journey into crossandra cultivation. The experts provided him with detailed guidance on every aspect of the crop, from planting techniques to the use of fertilizers, pest control methods, and market strategies etc. Furthermore, the farmer was guided by connecting him with trusted nurseries and suppliers in Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, where he was able to procure 6,000 healthy seedlings for his one-acre plot. The experts also advised him on ways to minimize the impact of nematodes, a common pest that can damage crossandra roots. They recommended the application of neem cake to the soil before transplanting, a natural remedy that helps reduce nematode populations and promotes healthy root development. Since water is a critical factor in flower cultivation, the scientists provided the farmer with a drip irrigation system through the project, as it can be a key element for the successful cultivation of crossandra. In addition to using the drip system for Indian Farming 34 November 2024 irrigation, the farmer also applied it for fertigation, which allowed him to efficiently deliver fertilizers through the irrigation pipes. This method significantly reduced water and fertilizer losses, saving both resources per unit of land. By implementing drip irrigation, the farmer also reduced labour costs related to irrigation and fertilizer application. He was also given a dry land weeder, for weeding when weed growth was minimal. This also helped him save money that would have otherwise been spent on manual weeding operations, further reducing cultivation costs. Knowledge, technical support and timely advice were vital in ensuring that farmer followed best practices in his farm, maximizing yield and profitability. The integrative approach adopted by the ICAR- CRIDA scientists highlighted that they were not only offering theoretical advice but were also involved in the practical aspects of Shri Srinivasâ€™s farm. They maintained regular contact with him, frequently visiting his farm to monitor the progress of the crop and to make timely interventions where necessary. This hands-on involvement ensured that Shri Srinivas was never left to navigate the challenges alone. The comprehensive support provided by the ICAR-CRIDA team covered every stage of the cultivation process, from planting to harvesting and even marketing. By providing the necessary knowledge, resources, and continuous guidance, the FFP team played a critical role in overcoming the challenges by introducing crossandra to a region where it had never been cultivated before. Their efforts set a strong foundation for the success of crop diversification plans and helped pave the way for the future adoption of crossandra cultivation by other farmers in the area.
