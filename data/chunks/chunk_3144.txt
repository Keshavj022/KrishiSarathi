7 Animal drawn weeder Animal drawn weeder (Blade hoe/ 3‐ tined cultivator) was developed for faster weeding in row‐seeded crops in limited period of weeding time compared to the manual hand‐hoe weeding (Cost of operation, Rs/ha=2000/‐). The improved weeder saved Rs.1000/‐ per ha besides higher command area per season (5 ha). The unit costs Rs.2000/‐. 3.2.8 Animal drawn sprayer Animal drawn sprayer received was modified for effective and faster spraying of plant protection chemicals especially in tall crops. Compared to the conventional method of application by knapsack/foot sprayers (Cost of operation, Rs/ha=300/‐) the animal drawn sprayer could save in cost of operation by Rs.100/‐ per ha besides saving of 0.5 lit/ha of chemicals amounting to Rs.200/‐. The sprayer costs Rs.25000/‐. 3.2.9 Pneumatic wheel bullock cart Improved cart was developed for carrying higher load (2 tonne) faster on tar/kuchcha road for longer distance compared to the carrying capacity of 01 tonne by traditional carts. The improved cart was designed optimally by use of standard parts for longer life (10 years) than the traditional carts (Life=3‐5 years). The unit price of the improved cart is Rs. 15000/‐ 30 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Agricultural Engineering www.icar.org.in 3.4 Development of technology 3.4.1 Draftability of bullocks Draftability of non‐descriptive breeds of Assam, Chhatishgarh and Orissa bullocks were measured under different seasonal conditions by use of loading car. The results showed that these bullocks (Average body weight = 500 kg per pair) could negotiate draft equivalent to 10 % of their body weight in all the seasons continuously for 3‐4 hours. 3.4.2 Work –rest cycle Work –rest cycles of 3h (work) – 1h (rest) – 3h (rest) for small bullocks of Orissa, Assam and Chhatisgarh region was found to be appropriate at draft load equivalent to 10% of their body weight. At draft load equivalent to 12% of body weight work‐rest cycle of 2h (work) – 1h (rest) – 2h(work) was found to be appropriate for sustained working. 3.4.3 Hardening of hoof shoes Technology for hardening of hoof shoes was developed. 3000 no. of hardened hoof shes were supplied to the users. Dies for mass production was developed. Results of FLD showed that the life of the hardened hoof shoes was increased by 147% compared to the traditional hoof shoes (Life = 145 h) which in turn reduced the cost of shoeing. 3.4.4 Economical feed formulation for work animals Economical feed rations based on locally available feed materials were developed for bullock, buffalo, camel and donkey keeping in view the nutrient utilization for increasing the draft capacity. The average expenditure on feed for bullocks (Body weight = 250‐350 kg) varied from Rs 40/‐ to Rs 55/‐ per day per pair.
