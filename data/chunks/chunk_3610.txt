 This will save approximately 20% of fertilizers and provide higher fruit yield and improved quality attributes. Guava Fertigation technology saves approximately 35% of the irrigation water and 20% of the fertilizers. Fruit yield and quality were also improved by drip irrigation of the guava orchards. The following irrigation and fertigation schedule for guava was recommended by PAU Ludhiana. Application of Fertilizers: The fertilizers were applied at weekly interval from July to September (12 splits) and March to May (12 splits). Strawberry The strawberry plant being a surface feeder requires frequent irrigations in order to maintain optimal soil moisture. The optimum vegetative growth of strawberries has been obtained under soil moisture conditions where tension does not exceed 1.0 atm. Strawberries are generally irrigated using the furrow method, but nowadays, drip irrigation is becoming popular pertaining to its higher water use efficiency. Fertigation via drip irrigation technique allows uniform distribution of plant nutrients within the root zone, however; majority of active roots are concentrated up to depth of 15-30 cm from soil surface leading to enhanced nutrient use efficiency. An ample supply of water is crucial throughout the growing season, especially during the plant growth and fruit development stages. Strawberry is highly sensitive to excessive soil moisture and irrigation must be applied through the drip system on a daily basis using lateral pipes with dripper discharge of 2.2 l/h and drippers are placed at 30 cm within a lateral pipe. Application of Fertilizers: Fertigation should be commenced after six days after transplanting of the Fertigation schedule for Kinnow (6 × 3 m) Age of trees February- April (15 splits) July-Mid September (12 splits) Urea UP MOP Urea UP MOP 1 115 - - 77 - - 2 230 - - 154 - - 3 346 - - 230 - - 4 370 240 80 247 160 120 5 466 300 80 310 200 120 6 558 360 80 373 240 120 7 647 420 80 431 280 120 8 742 480 240 494 320 160 Indian Horticulture 24 Monthly recommendations for applying water (litre/day/plant) to guava trees (6 × 5 m) using drip irrigation system Month Age of trees 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 January 0.5 0.8 2.3 2.8 5.3 5.7 7.0 8.0 8.4 February 0.6 2.3 4.5 5.7 9.6 10.2 11.4 12.5 13.2 March 1.2 3.4 7.5 9.9 15.9 17.0 18.4 19.2 19.8 April 2.4 8.5 16.0 17.9 28.8 30.5 32.5 33.6 34.5 May 3.0 14.9 19.2 23.0 37.5 39.5 41.5 43.4 44.0 June 3.3 13.1 18.6 27.0 47.8 49.2 51.4 52.6 53.0 July 2.4 10.0 11.9 19.7 28.1 30.5 32.4 33.5 33.8 August 1.9 6.9 11.6 14.9 20.6 22.5 24.3 24.8 25.0 September 1.4 7.6 9.7 14.0 18.4 20.2 21.5 22.7 23.0 October 1.3 5.4 8.5 10.8 13.2 13.8 15.0 16.2 16.8 November 0.8 3.0 5.4 4.0 8.8 9.2 10.4 11.1 12.1 December 0.4 2.1 3.3 5.0 5.2 6.0 6.8 7.2 7.
