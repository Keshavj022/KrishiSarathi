 The method solely relies on optical satellite data and can be easily implemented using widely used Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. The SPI algorithm holds high potential in future for solar power expansion monitoring as it makes easy detection of solar farms using open-source data. We have shown the potential of SPI for creating datasets of solar farm location and estimated installed capacity for the entire India. The application of computer vision algorithms based on high-resolution imagery and aerial photography were used for location of solar panels whereas others focused on mapping of solar power plants using significance of texture [46,47]. Overall, our SPI and other techniques showed their capability for easy detection of solar farms. The detection and allocation of solar power plant is thought to be good development for a region-specific location but the nexus between solar-argi-water is necessary for sustainable development. Agriculture is at the core of India’s economy; it is affected by various factors such as climatic and weather conditions, precipitation, field planning, sowing methods, and plantation orientation. Agricultural land encroachment for the construction of solar power plants has recently increased [78]. Farmers choose to invest in electric power production over food because power production is more profitable. This short-term benefit can have long-term impacts on the food industry. Therefore, it needs on ground information and analysis of soil condition under the solar panel structure. A field visit to solar power plants in Maharashtra (Fig. S5) provided us with an opportunity to collect soil samples and analyze them for any changes. We investigated the microbial populations within the topsoil (0–15 cm) of both solar panel sites and agricultural farms. Typical topsoil microbial communities consist of nematodes and protozoa (103 colonies), algae and fungi (105 colonies), and Table 2 Pearson correlation (r) among the classes of nexus.
