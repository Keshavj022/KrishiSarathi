 They can assess the condition of bridges, roads, buildings, and power lines more efﬁciently and safely than tra- ditional manual inspections. 6. Disaster management: In the aftermath of natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or ﬂoods, drones can be deployed to assess the extent of dam- age and facilitate search and rescue operations. Aerial data can help emergency responders identify critical areas and plan their interventions effectively. 7. Construction and surveying: Drones have become valuable tools in the construction and surveying industries. They can rapidly generate high-resolution 3D models of construction sites, monitor construc- tion progress, and provide topographic surveys for engineering projects [30]. 10 Journal of Sensors 8. Wildlife conservation: Drones are used in wildlife conservation efforts to monitor endangered species, track animal migrations, and identify potential threats to wildlife habitats. 9. Real-time monitoring: With advancements in com- munication technologies, drones can stream data in real-time, allowing operators to monitor situations as they unfold. This capability is particularly valuable in Step 1: Data collection Data are collected from various sources within the farm, including soil sensors, weather stations, satellite imagery, drones, and other IoT devices. These sources provide crucial information about soil health, weather conditions, crop growth, pest and disease occurrences, and other relevant parameters Step 2: Data preprocessing Raw data collected from different sources often requires cleaning, integration, and transformation to ensure consistency and accuracy. Missing values, outliers, and noise are addressed during this stage to prepare the data for analysis Step 4: Model selection Various predictive modeling techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, are considered for the specific problem at hand. The choice of the model depends on the type of data, the prediction task (e.g., yield prediction, disease outbreak forecasting), and the desired level of accuracy Step 5: Training the model The selected predictive model is trained using historical data where the outcomes are known. The model learns the patterns and relationships between the input features and the target variable (e.g., crop yield) during the training process Step 7: Prediction and decision-making Once the predictive model is deemed satisfactory, it can be deployed to make real-time predictions Step 8: Continuous improvement Predictive models in precision farming are dynamic and can be continuously updated with new data to improve their accuracy over time.
