Approximately 50% of the population in India relies on agriculture and related sectors for their livelihood. It contributed approximately 18.2% in 2022–2023 in country’s Gross Domestic Product. Over the past five years, the agriculture industry has experienced average annual growth of 4.18%. Along with having a sufficient supply of food grains on hand, the nation exports more than 7% of its food grains. The Indian economy has grown as a result of the expansion of the agricultural and related industries. But certain issues still exist. The performance of agriculture is impacted by low productivity levels, weather variability and fragmented land ownership. Artificial Intelligence is fast emerging across various sectors of the economy. It is time to realise the potential use of Artificial Intelligence in agriculture as it can help to overcome the problems in traditional agriculture. It also provides a vast opportunity of innovation and employment. The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in agriculture has advanced significantly since its initial attempt in 1985. By 2026, the global value of AI in agriculture is projected to reach USD 4 billion.
