 With this background, during 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08, an on farm testing (OFT) on redgram transplanting was conducted in 22 farmers field which was compared with dibbling and normal sowing method and able to harvest a record yield of 48.75 q per ha. To demonstrate on larger area and larger adoptability, frontline demonstrations on Transplanting technology in redgram was conducted in an area of 15 ha compared with local practice during 2008-09. Redgram transplanting technology helped to harvest an average seed yield of 29.70 q per ha with an average grass income and net income of `1,24,740 and 1,07,240 per ha, respectively, the cost of cultivation was `17,500 per ha. Whereas, it recorded an average yield of `17.5 q per ha in traditional practice with an average grass and net income of `73,000 and 58,500 per ha respectively and the cost of cost of cultivation in farmers field was `15,000 per ha. ICAR-KVK continued conducting further FLDs on redgram transplanting during 2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15. All these years, average yield obtained was 27.60 q/ha, gross income of `1,13,676/ha and net income of `93,176 with transplanted technology whereas it was 15.20 q/ha, `62,040/ha and `45,540 with farmers practice. Thus, analysis of FLD’s data revealed a remarkable 69.71% to 138% increase in yield Flowering stage Grand growth stage Pod filling stage Farmer with blooming crop through the implementation of transplanting technology compared to traditional farming practices followed by farmers. Having achieved the significant yield, redgram transplanting technology was standardized by ICAR- KVK, Bidar which includes preparation of seedlings and transplanting of seedlings in main field. Preparation of redgram seedlings In the first fortnight of May, the process of preparing seedlings begins with the utilization of 4 × 6 inch polythene bags (150 gauge), requiring approximately 6,050 seedlings per ha. These bags are carefully filled with a pot mixture, creating a conducive environment for germination. The filled bags are then arranged and idea, the scientists of ICAR-KVK designed trials about transplanting technology. ICAR-KVK, Bidar laid out a feeler trial during 2004-05 for studying the transplanting method for 50 plants and obtained good results. With this background, during 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08, an on farm testing (OFT) on redgram transplanting was conducted in 22 farmers field which was compared with dibbling and normal sowing method and able to harvest a record yield of 48.75 q per ha. To demonstrate on larger area and _ larger adoptability, frontline demonstrations on Transplanting technology in redgram was conducted in an area of 15 ha compared with local practice during 2008-09. Redgram transplanting technology helped to harvest an average seed yield of 29.70 q per ha with an average grass income and net income of %1,24,740 and 1,07,240 per ha, respectively, the cost of cultivation was %17,500 per ha.
