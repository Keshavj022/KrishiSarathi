 Sugarcane: Pre-seasonal sugarcane should be planted during 1st October to 15th November while seasonal sugarcane should be planted during 1st January to 15th February. 25 % more yield is realised from pre- seasonal sugarcane. Use improved varieties like MS-10001, VSI-08005, Co-86032, Co- 8014 (Mahalaxmi), CoM-0265, etc for higher yield Use 25-30 thousand two budded sets for planting; maintain row to row spacing of 90-100 cm and plant to plant spacing of 22 cm as per recommendations. Sugarcane sets should be treated with recommended pesticides, fungicides and biofertilizers like Acetobacter and PSB before planting and recommended dose of fertilizers 250:115:115 kg NPK / ha for seasonal sugarcane and 300:170:170 kg NPK / ha should be applied. Nitrogen doses should be applied in four equal splits. Advisories Related to Major Horticulture Crops Pomegranate: Take pruning for Ambiya Bahar in Pomegranate. Use improved and high yielding varieties like Bhagwa and Super Bhagwa. Give stress of 30 to 60 days according to soil type. Give light irrigation ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 309 for flowering. Precaution should be taken so that water stress condition may not occur in pomegranate orchard. Remove suckers shoot in pomegranate orchard. Apply FYM @ 40-50 kg per plant. Apply fertilizer dose of 400:200:200 g / plant after irrigation. Nitrogen should be given in two splits. Take a spray of potassium nitrate @ 15 gm per litre of water. Citrus (Orange and sweet orange): Ambiya bahar management is the key operation in orange and sweet orange in Rabi season. Stress management should be done in the month of November December as per soil type. 45 to 60 days water stress should be given as per soil type. Light irrigation should be given after completion of stress. Take a spray of potassium nitrate @ 15 gm per litre of water. Application of Bordo-paste should be done on tree trunk in the month of January-February to protect the crop from gummosis and dieback. Apply fertilizer dose of 400:200:200 g / plant after irrigation. Nitrogen should be given in two splits. Mango: Organic mulching should be done, and the orchard should be irrigated during early in the morning, at evening or during night hours. To protect the mango fruits from the incidence of fruit fly, install “Rakshak fruit fly trap” developed by university @ 4 traps per hectare. Fallen fruits should be collected and destroyed to keep orchard clean. Banana: To protect the crop from the severe cold wave, make a smoke in the orchard to increase the temperature in the evening and apply irrigation at night to raise the temperature. Organic mulching should be done in banana orchard. Irrigate banana orchard during ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 310 early in the morning, at evening or during nighttime. Grapes: Management of October pruning in grape orchard should be done as per availability of water.
