 Cauliflower I C 6 3 2 6 0 3 & IC632604 20030 Ogura based cytoplasmic male sterile line of early maturity group (25-30°C) of Indian cauliflower. CMS line with dwarf plant type. Good combiner for earliness and curd yield in early maturity group of Indian cauliflower. Cauliflower I C 6 3 2 6 0 1 & IC632602 20031 Cytoplasmic male sterile line of early maturity group (25-30°C) of Indian cauliflower. Carry Ogura sterile cytoplasm. Good combiner for earliness and curd yield. Collard green IC632940 20035 A tropical type–first of its kind in the world that bolts, flowers and sets seeds during spring season at Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. It does not require vernalization to stimulate/induce bolting and flowering. Fast growing and high leaf yield potential, i.e. 45-50 t/ha. Cauliflower I C 6 3 7 0 2 6 & IC637027 20092 Cytoplasmic male sterile line. Compact creamy white curd. Strongly waxy. Bluish green broad leaves. Cauliflower IC637585 21057 It is resistant to black rot disease (Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris race 1). Carry a novel single dominant gene Xca1bo for black rot resistance. Xca1bo gene is located on chromosome 3 and flanked by DNA markers Cabbage IC638877 21105 Self-Incompatible (SI) line. Flat compact head. Shorter stalk length. Cabbage IC638878 21106 Self-Incompatible (SI) line. Round and very compact head. Smaller plant spread and height with minimum number of non-wrapper leaves Broccoli IC632628 21214 Purple heading early tropical type broccoli which produce seeds in Northern plains during winter season. In head, buds are fine to medium fine and buds and their stalk are intense purple therefore rich in anthocyanin (30.0 mg/100 g fw). Average marketable head weight ranges from 650-810 g and marketable yield is 27.0 t/ha. Cauliflower IC642000 21217 It is resistant to black rot disease (Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris race 1). Carries single dominant resistant gene Cauliflower IC642001 21218 PC-1 is a new genotype of Purple Sicilian type (an intermediate type of cauliflower and broccoli) which produce attractive purple curds with light green stalks. The purple curding phenotype is governed by a single locus Pr with incomplete dominance but different from purple cauliflower. ‘PC-1’ curds are rich in anthocyanin (40.6±2.74 mg/100 g FW) and mature in December month and produce seed profusely in sub- tropical condition. Cauliflower IC643987 22047 Highly resistant to downy mildew disease (c.o. Hyaloperonospora parasitica). Carry single dominant gene Ppa207 for downy mildew resistance. The resistant gene Ppa 207 was mapped in 4.8 cM linkage interval on linkage group 2 (C02) of cauliflower, flanked by the markers BoGMS0486 and BoGMS0900 at 3.6 and 1.2 cM, respectively. includes the ‘cole crops’ such as cabbage, cauliflower, knol-khol, brussels sprouts, broccoli and kale (Table 6).
