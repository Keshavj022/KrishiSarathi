 Learning from the scenario analysis of the AG-ADAPT model, we put forth four main insights from our study. First, our results indicate that the decision-making process of most farmers, including marginal, small, medium, and large farmers, to adopt yield technologies such as high Table 5 Model performance ratio (MPR) of scenarios A-D for all farmer agents.

Results of the sensitivity analysis. U. Sanga et al.

The model performance for the adoption of high yielding varieties and enhanced use of fertilizers increased with farm size, implying larger farmers were more likely to implement utility maximization decision heuristics when adopting such adaptation strategies (Table 6a). This result is consistent with insights that the decisions of farmers often exist within a spectrum of farming for subsistence and commercial profitability, depending on farm size (Stringer et al., 2020). Farming households with higher capital endowment, including land, are more likely to undertake such adapta­ tion strategies due to their higher investment capacity (Shukla et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2019). Our results support the use of policy in­ terventions that use economic incentives and promote the yield-enhancing capacity of these adaptation strategies to encourage their adoption but cautions against a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach that may perpetuate social and economic inequalities arising from differen­ tial capabilities of farmers to adopt these strategies (Shukla et al., 2019). Second, our results indicate that the adoption of climate tolerant varieties by farmers was most closely guided by self-satisficing and social-normer decision-rules, with the model performance, under both scenarios, highest for marginal landholders. We interpret this to suggest that given certain climate tolerant varieties do not necessarily have high Fig. 6.
