) vi Recommendations:   Promoting the concept of water harvesting in all forms, with appropriate techniques should be given due importance.   Development and testing of new concepts, technologies and management structures for water and waste water is required. NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (NRM) Compendium Salient Recommendations 50 NRM 27 i Name of the Society: Indian Society of Coastal Agricultural Research, CSSRI Regional Research Station, Canning Town, West Bengal ii Title: 12th National Symposium on Coastal Agriculture: Boosting Production Potential under Stressed Environment iii Venue and Date(s): Dr. Balasaheb Sawant Krishi Vidyapeeth, Dapoli (Maharashtra), 28 September-01 October, 2018 iv Amount of grant by ICAR Rs. 5.10Lakhs v ICAR's Sanction no. F.No.23 (39)/2018-Cdn (Tech) vi Recommendations:   In order to prioritize and target reclamation measures, use of emerging tools like high resolution and hyperspectral remote sensing should be used for rapid and accurate assessment.   It is essential to revisit the critical level in relation to soil texture, content and nature of clay.   It is recommended that programme to monitor water quality, environmental flows and sedimentation rates be established at identified critical locations in the estuaries.   Hydro-salinity modelling in areas, where crop and brackish water aquaculture on large scale is being undertaken, should be initiated to study impact on cultivated lands. This will enable to evaluate the synergies and conflicts of crop and brackish water aquaculture to properly manage the costal zones.   Due attention should be given for development of a spatial database on water resources availability, crop yield potential and yield gap in order to target location specific management decisions for improving water productivity.   Integrated farming system approach involving promising germplasm from plant, animal and fish component is required to be adopted.
