 Jain indicated that all records regarding BNBt were available with ICAR, that he was unwell and that he could not recollect issues connected with the meetings pertaining to BNBl. Dr. K.C. Jain's letter is at Annexure-V (Pg. 71). ICAR may like toÂ· take note of the fact that Dr. K. C. Jain was not forthcoming to the committee in this matter. 3.05 In the meeting of March 25, 2012, it had also been decided that the team consisting of Drs. Dhillon and Rathore would meet the CICR scientists. Accordingly, Drs. Dhillon and Rathore met the CICR scientists (Dr. K.R. Kranthi, Dr. Suman Bala Singh and Dr. G. Balasubramani) on April 5, 2012, in Delhi. The record of discussion with Dr. K.R. Kranthi is at Annexure-VI-A (Pgs. 72-81); that with Dr. Balasubramani is at Annexure-VI-B (Pgs. 82-84); and record of discussion with Dr. Suman Bala Singh is at Annexure-VI-C (Pgs. 85-86). 3.06 The third and fourth meetings of the Committee were held in the office of Vice Chancellor, JNU on May 5, 2012 and June 7, 2012, to discuss the matter in detail, based on the papers provided by ICAR, the interaction at NRCPB, UAS and scientists of CICR, and replies provided by the scientists of these Institutes. The Committee discussed in detail contents of its report in meetings held on July 24 and August 25, 2012. The Committee's conclusions are based on the site visits and discussions with parties concerned, as well as perusal of relevant documents. THE REPORT 4.00 The first term of reference to the Committee is to examine whether the team achieved a separate and distinct event other than MON531, which they called BNLA106, and whether there was enough evidence for a claim to be made that BNLA106 was an event separate and distinct from MON531 event of Monsanto. 4.01 The presence of MON531 event in BNBt is so extensive that the only sample of the original BNBt that is available for analysis is the supposedly "purified" BNBl. The committee therefore focused its attention on determining whether "purified" BNBt is 6 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - different from MON531, and whether the characteristics of "purified" BNBt match with those described for original BNBt in the Katageri et al., 2007, paper in Current Science. Specifically, the committee examined the molecular characterization of "purified" BNBt that has been carried out at NRCPB, and assessed whether the described characteristics of the event in "purified" BNBt are, on one hand, different from MON531 and, on the other hand, similar to those described for BNBt by Katageri et al., 2007. 4.02 The committee noted that the molecular characterization of BNLA106 event as described by Katageri et al., 2007, was minimal. Event specific primers that would have made a comparison with MON531 fairly straightforward had not been described. This should have been done by NRCPB, which provided the gene construct, as it has the requisite expertise. The Current Science paper of Katageri et al.
