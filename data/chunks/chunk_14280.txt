 The models used for the predicted maps are very accurate and sufficient. So, it’s safe to say that Random Forest and FCOPRAS are better for analysing soil potentiality (Fig. 5). Fig. 4.

Block), Gokamo, and Bagichapur G.P. (Harirampur C.D. Block) have very low soil potential, while Udaypur, Kalikamera, and Maligaon G.P. have higher soil potential. Places with very high soil potential for agriculture include Ellahbad (Banshihari C.D. Block), Bel­ bari, Gangarampur G.P. (Gangarampur C.D. Block), etc. From the ML outputs, it is found that Sukhdebpur G.P., Maligaon G.P., Basuria G.P. Nandanpur G.P., NW Saiyadpur G.P., Southern Sirshi G.P., Ganguria G. P., NW Karanji G.P. have the least potential, whereas Berail G.P., Deul G. P., Akcha G.P., Asokegram G.P., Kushmandi G.P., Northern Karanji G.P., etc have the highest potential for agriculture. Deficiency in Nitrogen, Copper (Chaudhry and Loneragan., 1970), low Soil Moisture (Nagy et al., 2007), Deficiency in Manganese (Schmidt et al., 2016), Zinc, Sulphur, Boron, Phosphate, Potassium (Seth et al., 2018), High Bulk Density (Blake, 1965), Older Alluvial Soil, High pH, and least soil depth, etc are the main reason behind low to very low potentiality of Soil for agriculture. Whereas Optimum concentration of Nitrogen (>65 cg/kg−1), Copper (1.02–1.98 ppm), Soil Moisture (0.36–0.78), Manganese (11.0–19.98 ppm), Zinc (0.75–0.99 ppm), Boron (0.25–0.38 ppm), Sulphur (75.0–113.36 mg/kg−1), Phosphate (>195.0 kg/ha−1), Potassium (>200 kg/ha−1), low Bulk Density (<1.55 g/cm3), Older Alluvial Soil, ideal PH (6.5–7.5), low EC (<0.46 dS/m−1), higher CEC activity (>20.0 cmloc/kg−1) and ideal soil depth (<5000 cm) etc are the main reason behind low to very low soil positive po­ tentiality for agriculture.
