 Additional Krishi Vigyan Kendra in the district be established only based on specific criteria such as: large rural population, bigger geographical area, higher net sown area, relative Executive Summary backwardness norms of the district, more Tribal/Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe population, and those in mountainous (above 5000 feet above mean sea level) and difficult/border areas. 4. The position of Programme Coordinator of Krishi Vigyan Kendra should be re-designated as ‘Chief Scientist- cum-Head’, in the cadre of Principal Scientist/Professor (PB-4, ` 37400-67000 with GP ` 10000), for effective management, implementation of mandated activities through proper coordination and convergence with line departments, including the district administration. 5. Further, all Subject Matter Specialists in Indian Council of Agricultural Research/State Agriculture Universities/Non-Governmental Organizations/State Government Krishi Vigyan Kendras should henceforth be redesignated uniformly as Scientist/Assistant Professor (PB-3, ` 15600-39100 with GP ` 6000) to ensure much needed parity across teaching, research and extension positions. 6. SMSs who are in technical cadre at present in Krishi Vigyan Kendras under Indian Council of Agricultural Research Institute should be redeployed or redesignated as Scientists and the positions may be adjusted through cadre strength of the concerned Indian Council of Agricultural Research institute/overall Indian Council of Agricultural Research level. 7.

Since Krishi Vigyan Kendras are 100% funded by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the host organizations be accorded full freedom and assume full responsibility to recruit Krishi Vigyan Kendra staff without any restriction/ban. Krishi Vigyan Kendras should not be sanctioned or annual grants released unless the State Government agrees to recruit all sanctioned staff. Also the staff recruited in Krishi Vigyan Kendra must not be transferred for at least five years. The Memorandum of Understanding should also be clearly modified to this effect. 9. Pay structure, as sanctioned by Indian Council of Agricultural Research for the Krishi Vigyan Kendra staff, should be adopted by all host organizations without any variation whatsoever. Krishi Vigyan Kendra under Non-Governmental Organizations, which do not have approved promotion policy, must adopt Modified Assured Career Progression Scheme as implemented by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and amended from time to time.
