 Itis one of the 12 native species of medicinal plants domesticated India's traditional medical systems — Ayurvedic, Sidha and Unani have been time-honoured and time-tested for over 3,000 years. Our local communities use over 7,000 species of plants. In fact 20% of the MEDICINAL PLANTS GUJARAT ISABGOL 1, | Henbane GUJARAT ISABGOL 2.

The ICAR through the All-India Coordinated Research Project on Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (begun in 1972) is carrying out an integrated multidisciplinary research at 9 centres on chosen crops that include 12 mandatory crops: psyllium, senna, opium poppy, periwinkle, liquorice, asgandh, jasmine, palmarosa, lemon grass, vetiver, rose, geranium and patchouli; 10 introduced crops (of exotic origin): Solanum viarum, henbane, Chamomilla, sage, basil, lavender, Rosemery, lemon-mint, Nelis and anise; and 12 native species for domestication: Swertia, safed musli, aloe, babchi, Mucuna, pipalamul, satavari, Valerian, Indian bdellium and Galangal. In the last two decades alarge number of varieties have been developed — 21 in medicinal plants and 27 in aromatic plants. Management technologies have been standardized for all the varieties. Cropping systems involving vetiver, palmarosa, opium poppy, psyllium, senna and Rauvolfia have been recommended. Patchouli has been accepted as an intercrop in coconut gardens. Principal chemical compounds using HPLC, and aroma chemicals using gas chro- matography, have also been estimated. A National Research Centre for Medicinal and Aromatic Plants has been very recently setup at BoriaviFarms, Anand, Gujarat. PLANTATION AND Planting or replanting with improved varieties, grafting of existing trees, inter-, SPICE CROPS mixed-, multiple-, and multi-storeyed cropping systems coupled with the practice of crop husbandry in plantation and spice crops has led to fulfilling of the ever- increasing demand for these crops and in sustaining domination in their export. Many of them are committed to the land for decades and they have prolonged juvenile phase. Research results are therefore slow.
