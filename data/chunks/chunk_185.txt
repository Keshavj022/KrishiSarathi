With an annual demand of 10,000 MT for 'Kerala Karimeen' far exceeding the production of 2,000 MT, there is a growing interest in pearlspot culture. However, limited availability of seeds, with an annual requirement of 40 million, poses a critical challenge. Addressing the low fecundity and unique reproductive behaviours of pearlspot, this article introduces an innovative seed production approach in pond systems. The article emphasizes pond preparation for optimal conditions, brood fish management, facilitating breeding environments, breeding behaviours etc. are explored. Parental care, predator control, economic and marketing aspects are also discussed. The innovative pond system approach emerges as a promising solution for making quality seeds available for pearlspot aquaculture. Keywords: Breeding, Fecundity, Pearlspot, Pond systems, Seed production, Water quality T HE Pearlspot (Karimeen), native to the coastal waters of Peninsular India and colloquially known as Karimeen, stands as an iconic symbol of Kerala’s culinary excellence. Renowned for its exquisite taste, it carries cultural significance in local celebrations and is a culinary highlight for tourists along Kerala’s coastal line. Acknowledging the socio-economic importance, especially in backwater tourism, the Kerala government designated pearlspot as the 'State Fish of Kerala'. The inherent quality of pearlspot is intricately linked to Kerala’s backwaters, imparting an authentic flavour. Locally sourced pearlspot is preferred over imports from neighbouring states, where the fish is reared in freshwater and often considered inferior. Nevertheless, the current annual production of 2,000 MT falls drastically short of meeting the escalating demand of 10,000 MT per annum for 'Kerala Karimeen'. This substantial gap between supply and demand has prompted farmers to explore pearlspot culture. However, a critical constraint in this endeavour is the low availability of seeds. The annual seed requirement stands at 40 million, and the existing availability of only 8 million in Kerala highlights the pressing need to enhance pearlspot seed production. Low fecundity The primary challenge arises from the low fecundity of the species.
