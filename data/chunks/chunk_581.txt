 This design provides wide array of benefits economically (income throughout the year from multiple products such as wood, food, fodder, fruits, tree borne oilseeds), ecologically (carbon sequestration, habitat for biodiversity, soil and water conservation, nutrient cycling, improving soil productivity and faunal activities) and sustainably (diversified production system that reduces risk associated with climatic vagaries and also reduces incidence of pest and diseases, breaks poverty and achieves food security in the long term). Assessing ecosystem services Agroforestry always aims at finding nature-based solutions and more specifically its external benefits can be broadly called ecosystem services. It is the direct and indirect contributions of an ecosystem to the human well- being. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) has indicated that approximately 60%, i.e. 15 out of 24 ecosystem services are being degraded or unsustainably used as a result of agricultural management and other anthropogenic activities. MEA classified ecosystem services as provisioning services, regulating services, supporting services and cultural services. Since then, quantifying ecosystem services has gained significant attraction in agroforestry systems. However, studies on provisioning services and carbon regulation in agroforestry systems have been documented widely. Therefore, in this study, ecosystem services as a whole were quantified and economically valued (excluding establishment cost as services are only accounted) in the MFA model between 2018 and 2022. Provisioning services: These are quantified as the tangible benefits of food, fodder, flowers, fruits, tree borne oilseeds, timber, plywood and moringa. The products were given monetary values based on the current price in market and an overall provisioning service generated from multifunctional agroforestry was `355103.20 at the end of three years. Regulating services: These are the benefits obtained from the ecosystem that modulates the environment a favourable condition to live, viz. regulation of air, water and climate, soil fertility, carbon sequestration, pollination, flood control, pest, and disease regulation and water quality regulation. Agroforestry is known for improving the resilience of small farmers by moderating micro- Ecosystem service quantification from multifunctional agroforestry Table 2.
