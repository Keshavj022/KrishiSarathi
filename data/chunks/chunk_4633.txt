Flowers are formed at leafless parts of the main branches, at the upper part of the tree. These are borne in clusters composed of male, female or hermaphrodite flowers. The flowers are small and pinkish and appear in clusters in 5 to 12.5 cm long panicles at leafless parts of the main branches, at the upper part of the tree. The fruit is ripe between 90-100 days. The fruits are numerous, oblate, with 6 to 8 ribs, and are densely clustered. They are pale yellow or white, waxy, crisp, juicy and very sour. The fruits mature in May and October–November. A mature tree may yield 5-7 kg fruits. The raw or ripe fruits are used for making chutneys or souring agents. The pulp is rich in carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins (Table 1). Surinam cherry Surinam cherry (Eugenia uniflora L.) is a shrub with spreading branches. It is native of Surinam, Guyana and French Guiana to southern Brazil. It was introduced in India by Portuguese voyagers long back. The leaves are ovate to ovate-lanceolate. The flowers are white, borne singly or in cluster of 2-4 in leaf axils. The fruits are ribbed, oblate, 2-4 cm diameter, bright-red to deep-scarlet coloured at ripening. The fruit pulp is orange-red, juicy, acid - sweet with 1 to 3 smaller seeds. Surinam cherry is adapted to tropical and sub-tropical regions. Young plants are damaged by low temperature. The plant requires full sunshine. It requires only moderate rainfall and being deep-rooted, can stand a long dry season. The Surinam cherry grows in almost in all type of soils, But it is intolerant to salt. Seeds are common mean of propagation. They remain viable for around one month and fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 4 weeks. Layering has been successful. Regular fertilizer application promotes fruiting. The fruits develop and ripen quickly, only 3 weeks after the flowers open. The plants bloom in May–June and fruits ripe within a month, they bloom again in October and November.
