 CIARI-GroPro 41 Introduction Microorganisms, as an important driver of biogeochemical cycles, play a key role in soil fertility and nutrient uptake by plants. Biofertilizers include nitrogen fixing, phosphate, potassium and zinc solubilising; nutrient mobilizing microorganisms used for application to seed or soil. The manipulation of rhizosphere of plants leads to increase in numbers of such microorganisms and thereby accelerate the microbial processes which augment the availability of nutrients that can be assimilated by plants. Biofertilizers are economical and ecofriendly alternative of chemical fertilizers. Integrated nutrient management (INM) considers biofertilizers as an important component and advocates judicious application of fertilizers along with organic manures and biofertilizers which is imperative to sustain crop production and maintenance of soil health in the long term. Rhizosphere bacteria that favourably influence plant growth and yield of crop plants are designated as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). They not only influence plant growth but also help the plants to overcome abiotic and biotic stresses. In India, biofertilizer industry has developed over years and many significant changes have taken place. The shift from carrier based to liquid formulations, inclusion of microbial consortium in Fertilizer Control Order (FCO), increase in numbers of efficient strains have led to the surge in production of biofertilizers. ICAR is continuously striving to develop quality assured biofertilizers using efficient and competitive strains. This bulletin is a compilation of 41 biofertilizer technologies developed by ICAR that are at different stages of commercialization.
