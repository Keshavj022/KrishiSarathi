 l There is a wider appreciation of the need for improved priority setting, monitoring and evaluation (PME) mechanisms in the NARS. l The progress in multidisciplinary and multi-institutional research approach, though steady but is slow on account of some problems, which are considered as transitional. To accelerate this process further, there is much scope for improving reliability, functionality and efficiency of electronic connectivity in the system. l Peer review of NATP projects is yielding good results and eco- regional approach in research planning and implementation is greatly appreciated. l Human capital development is the greatest opportunity under NATP. Despite concrete outputs from previous training programmes, the progress is very slow. It will be a missed opportunity, if progress cannot be made under this soon. l Competitive research funding is doing very well, though there is a scope to improve it further. The allocation of funds under NATP largely to support operational funds, and priority research (areas, ecosystems, themes etc.) is welcomed widely. But the progress in utilization at the project level is picking up at a slow pace. Reforms in financial management including simplification of rules and procedures hold the key. l Another important determinant is decentralization of powers at all levels. l Poor performance in utilization of funds are attributed to PIU (NATP) itself. Delays in release of funds, complexities in purchase of equipment, completion of audit and submissions of statement of expenditure (SOE) etc., are the important issues. Problems like delay in release of grants to principal investigators (PIs), completion of audit and submission of SOE, and compatibility with non-NATP projects, are within the organizations themselves. It may be too early to track the socio-economic impact of the projects under NATP. But the early trends of expected impacts of selected technologies in all the agro-ecosystems are encouraging. There is a need to document and report the socio-economic information so that its quantification becomes easy later. AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH DATA BOOK Â– 2002 The Agricultural Research Data Book 2002, the sixth in the series, comprises 195 tables, and eleven sections. List of important national and international Institutions associated with agricultural research and education along with their addresses and contact points are also given. POTATO AND GINGER STATUS The potato and ginger crops are the most important crops grown in Meghalaya so their reliable and stable estimates were calculated. The area under potato in East Khasi Hills was estimated as 3,124 ha. The average yield pooled over different varieties was 6,833 kg/ha. The ginger crop area was estimated as 1,240 ha. The average yield was estimated as 4,042 kg/ha. Entire potato growing area was benefited by manures and fertilizers and 47% of the area was benefited by plant protection chemicals.
