Antibiogram study of Kala jeera ether extract (A1- 2mg, A2-1mg, A3-0.5 mg, A4-0.25mg per disc) and Methonolic extract (B1, B2, B3, B4) in similar concentration, with standard antibiotic the antibiotics were found to be sensitive for Pasteurella multocida P52 culture (Table 4, Fig 2). In first trial, the methanolic extract of KJ, at higher concentration (32, 16 and 8 mg) exhibited lesser inhibitory zone, viz. 12, 11 and 9 mm, respectively as compared to lower concentration (4 mg), which exhibited 32 mm inhibitory zone. Ether extract at 32 and 16 mg exhibited lesser zone of inhibition i.e. of 6 and 9 mm respectively. However, 2 mg concentration showed higher inhibitory zone of 37 mm (Table 4, Fig. 2). In second trial, (Table 5) the inhibitory zone at higher concentration of Table 4. Antibiogram profile of various extracts using Pasteurella multocida P52 strain in first trial.

Antibiogram profile of various methonolic extracts using Pasteurella multocida P52 strain lesser inhibitory zone (15, 14 and 12 mm), as compared to lower concentration (4 and 2 mg), which showed higher zone of inhibition (18 mm each). The in vitro study revealed that both methanol and ether extract of kala jeera have antibacterial activity. The overall antibacterial effect of both the extracts was exhibited better in lower concentration (4 mg/< 4 mg/disc) than that of higher concentration (> 4 mg/disc). It seems that extracts of lower concentration works better than of higher concentration. The clinical study was conducted over 5 clinical cases (Table 6), which were precipitated during current mansoon season, in buffaloes suffering with pneumonic pasteurellosis and exhibiting all pathognomic signs of disease, including high rise of temperature respiratory distress, nasal discharge, swelling on throat and Table 6.
