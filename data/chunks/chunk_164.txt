Diversity of underutilized horticultural crops in terms of value- addition and post-harvest management The untapped potential of indigenous and lesser- known horticultural crops in the region remains underutilized, despite their ability to address issues of poverty, food insecurity, and nutritional deficiencies through processing, value addition, and diverse applications. These fruits and vegetables boast high levels of vitamins and minerals, along with valuable secondary metabolites and medicinal properties that can be harnessed for industrial and medicinal purposes. Additionally, these underexplored crops exhibit resilience in adverse environmental conditions. Farmers in the Northeast are well-informed about these crops and their medicinal benefits, often using them to treat various ailments. Nevertheless, these crops are predominantly cultivated in backyard gardens or forested areas and are yet to be commercially grown. The various value-added products, such as jam, jelly, pickles, wine sauce, chutney, etc., and commercial products including essential oils, fibre, and dye, can be prepared from these underutilized horticultural crops. This provides an opportunity to boost income for local farmers and promotes sustainable agricultural practices.
