(Fig. 10) Comparative effect of different quantities of cowdung ash on aphid population and growth of cabbage The results of this experiment are given in Tables 10, 11 and Fig. 9. In the control (untreated) cabbage, the number of aphids increased initially and then declined substantially, before stabilizing finally. This decline may be due to the drought conditions, which resulted in the unfavorable conditions for aphid survival. The balance in aphid population at later stages may be due to the return of favorable conditions. Results obtained include the following: Fig. 9. Effect of cow-dung ash on number of aphids The treatment with 50 g ash per plant was found to be effective against aphids as it eradicated aphids completely in 34 days after- treatment. The treatment with 100 g ash per plant was more effective than with 50 g ash per plant, as it was able to eradicate the aphid in 16 days. The treatment with 150 g ash per plant was most effective, as it was able to eradicate the aphid in 16 days. Though treatment of cabbage with 150 g ash per plant seems to be the most effective; there was no significant different between 100 g and 150 g ash treatments. The effect of different quantities of ash on the number of leaves and plant height did not show any difference amongst themselves. This may similarly be due to the lack of rain and subsequent non-availability of nutrients from the soil under dry climatic conditions. In the present study both cowdung and cattle urine have been found to posses marked aphicidal property. The application of both urine and ash was made when the cabbage plants were at 4 to 5 leaf stage and approximately 500 ml of each urine  HORTICULTURAL CROPS Table 11.
