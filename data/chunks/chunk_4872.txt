 Using high-resolution cameras and deep learning algorithms, these systems can scan leaves and stems for abnormalities that indicate the presence of pests or diseases, such as discolouration, spots or deformation. AI models trained on thousands of images can accurately identify specific pathogens or pests, enabling early interventions that reduce the need for chemical pesticides. For instance, detecting aphid infestations early can prevent the spread of the pests without resorting to broad-spectrum pesticides. Automated pollination with AI: In protected cultivation, where natural pollinators like bees may be absent, AI-driven robots or drones can facilitate effective pollination. These devices use computer vision and AI to detect flowers ready for pollination and mimic the action of natural pollinators. For instance, small drones equipped with soft brushes can gently transfer pollen between flowers, increasing the likelihood of fruit set in crops like tomatoes or cucumbers, which rely on precise pollination for yield. Smart fertilization and irrigation: AI modules are also used in fertigation systems to optimize the delivery of nutrients and water. Sensors in the soil or artificial growing medium provide real-time data on nutrient levels and water content. AI algorithms analyze this data alongside environmental conditions to determine the exact amount of water and nutrients required by the plants. This ensures that each plant receives what it needs for growth without excess water or fertilizers, which can lead to wastage or nutrient runoff. This precision improves crop yields, while reducing resource consumption and minimizing the environmental impact.

AI modules optimize water usage by ensuring that irrigation occurs only when plants need it, reducing water consumption by as much as 40%. Similarly, AI- driven fertigation systems ensure that plants receive the exact amount of nutrients required at specific crop growth stage, minimizing waste and improving nutrient uptake and their use efficiency. Higher yields and better quality: By continuously adjusting environmental factors such as light, temperature, and nutrient delivery, AI systems can create optimal growth conditions for crops, leading to higher yields, productivity and improved crop quality. AIâ€™s ability to predict and prevent stress factors (such as pests, diseases, moisture deficiency and nutrient imbalances) ensures that plants remain healthy, which directly contributes to better yields. Labour savings: Automation through AI reduces the need for manual labour, particularly in tasks like monitoring, irrigation, fertigation, and climate control.
