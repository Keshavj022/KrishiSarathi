Experiment The organoleptic acceptability of ethnic food was assessed. The scores for organoleptic characteristics revealed that curry of apple snail prepared with oil and spices was rated very high (7.6) as compared to that of flat snail (6.3). Data presented in Table 4 show that curry of apple snail obtained higher scores 9 and 7 in respect of the taste and flavour respectively than the curry of flat snail with corresponding scores of 6 and 7. The curry of apple snail is preferred over that of the flat snail. Laboratory studies Laboratory analysis for estimation of the of comparative availability, apple snail scored higher (82) than flat snail (72). Further, apple snail was rated superior to flat snail on different characters such as popularity, availability, nutritional value, medicinal value and deliciousness. preperation. Majority of the people were found to be using the preparation made from apple snail in comparison to flat snail. Selected characteristic of two ethnic food materials Food prepared from apple snail scored very high (96) in terms of its popularity and medicinal value (Table 2). Apple snail is considered highly nutritious (90), delicious (88) and beneficial (86). It was also revealed that these two varieties of snails were easily available.
