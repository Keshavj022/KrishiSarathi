 All types of broad leaf weeds can be managed by application of Metsulfuron @ 20g/ha + surfactant with 500 litres water at 30-35 days after sowing of the crop. Management of malwa, jungali palak, hirankhuri and other broad leaf weeds can be done by application of carbentrazone ethyl 40% DF @ 50 g/ha with 500-liter water at 30-35 days after sowing of the crop. Management of all type of broadleaf weeds in wheat can be done by application of Metsulfuron methyl + carbentrazonethyl @ 50 g/ha + 0.2 % surfactant with 300 litres water at 30-35 days after sowing of the crop. Management of grassy weeds: Wild oat (Avena sp.) and kanki (Phalaris sp.) are two grassy weeds which emerge in wheat crop. These weeds can be managed by application of any of the following herbicides- Cladinofop 15 % W.P @ 400 g/ ha at 30-35 DAS. Sulfosulfuron 75 W.P @ 32.5 g/ha +1250 ml surfactant at 30-35 DAS. Finoxaprop 10% EC @ 1kg/ha + 500 g surfactant at 30-35 DAS. Pinoxaden 50% EC @ 1.0 liter/ha at 30-35 DAS. Management of mixed weed flora: There are some situations where both broad leaf and grassy weeds infest the crop. Management of ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 123 mixed weed flora can be done by application of any of the following herbicides- Apply Total (Sulfosulfuron + Metsulfuron) @ 40 g/ha with 500 liters water at 30-35 DAS. Do not grow sorghum, maize, and moong in fields where Total was applied. Apply Atlantis 3.6 WP (Mesosulfuron + idosulfuron) @ 400g/ha + 0.1 % Atlatis activator with 200-liter water at 30-35 DAS. Do not grow sorghum and maize in such fields after wheat crop. Vesta 16% WP (Cladinofop propyrizil + metsulfuron methyl) @ 400 g/ha +1250 ml surfactant with 500 liters at 30-35 DAS. Accord plus 22 % EC (Fenoxaprop + Metribuzin) @ 1250 ml/ha with 500-liter water at 30-35 DAS. Do not apply the herbicide in wheat varieties: PBW 550, WH 542 WH 283. ACM 9 (Cladinofop + Metribuzin) @ 600 g/ha with 500-liter water at 30-35 DAS. Shogun (Cladinofop + Metribuzin) @ 500 g/ha with 500-liter water at 30-35 DAS. Management of resistant Phalaris in wheat: Resistance against herbicides in Phalaris minor has been reported in rice-wheat system. Management of resistant biotypes of Phalaris minor is comparatively difficult in comparison to management of susceptible biotypes. Apply pendimethalin 30 EC @5.0 liter/ ha as pre-emergance with 625-liter water or pyroxasulfon 85% @ 150 g/ha in combination with pendimethalin @5.0 liter/ ha and in sequence apply pinoxaden 9% EC @ 1.0 liter/ha or cladinofos 15 % WP@400g/ha or sulfosulfuron 75% W.G. @32.5 g/ha or total @ 40 g/ha or atlantis @ 400g/ha or shagun @500g/ha or ACM 9 @600 g/ha at 30-35 DAS. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 124 January Month If four irrigations are available, apply first irrigation at 22 DAS (CRI state), second irrigation at 45 DAS (tillering stage), third irrigation at 85 DAS (spike formation) and forth irrigation at 105 DAS. It is necessary to apply first irrigation at time.
