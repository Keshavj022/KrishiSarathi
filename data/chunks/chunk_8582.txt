 ANIMAL BREEDING CATTLE Analysis of data of IVRI dairy herd for the years 1970–1999 indicated that the effect of generation was significant for production, reproduction and production efficiency traits of cows belonging to FH, FBH, BFH, JFH genetic grades. The performance of cows of F2 and F3 generations in all the genetic groups improved compared to F1. Frieswal The present cattle population consists of 21,369 females including 14,290 Frieswal and 7,079 other crosses located at 43 Military Farms under this project. At present 837 elite cows are available at different Military Farms out of which 604 are Frieswal, and 233 are 3/8 and other of lower crosses. Lactation yield, 300 days milk yield, lactation length and peak yield of Frieswal cows were 3,146.12 ± 79.42 kg, 3,011.31 ± 73.66 kg, 317.67 ± 9.15 days and 14.53 ± 0l.36 kg, respectively. The average age and weight at first calving, dry period, service period and calving interval of Frieswal cows were 987.71 ± 10.59 days and 360.15 ± 4.24 kg, 110.73 ± 11.23 days, 179.36 ± 13.80 days and 426.86 ± 13.97 days, respectively. The overall age and body weight of Frieswal bulls at first semen donation were 628.9 ± 26 days and 399.3 ± 8.13 kg, respectively. Year and seasons significantly affected the milk production performance of Frieswal cows. The wet and herd averages (kg) of Frieswal cows during summer, rainy season and winter were 10.08 ± 0.04 and 7.39 ± 0.03, 8.53 ± 0.04 and 6.18 ± 0.04, and 9.53 ± 0.03 and 6.99 ± 0.03, respectively. Hot humid weather conditions adversely affected the production performance of Frieswal cows. The reduction in wet and herd averages from March (highest average yield) to October (lowest average yield) was 23.39 and 26.67%, respectively. Nearly 630,000 doses are presently available for future use, and 36 bulls are under collection semen in the project. Indigenous Breeds Indigenous cattle breeds, viz. Hariana, Ongole, Gir and Tharparkar are being covered under Indigenous Breeds Project . Hariana: At the CCS HAU,Hisar, the breeding population consisted of 782 females, 6 breeding bulls and 37 young bulls (above 2 years). Overall conception rate in heifers and cows was 46.7% and 50.6%, respectively. In total 1,124 (348+213+238+261+64) daughters have so far been produced due to 5 sets, respectively. On closing date 36,531 doses of frozen semen of test bulls were available. Average age at first calving, first lactation milk yield and peak yield was 51.87 months, 866 kg and 4.415 kg, respectively. First dry period, service period and calving interval averaged 269, 207 and 497 days, respectively. Ongole: At the ANGRAU, Lam, female herd strength was 1,118, the breeding population consisted of 692 females, 11 breeding bulls and 11 young bulls (above 2 Best indigenous bull from Karnataka l Production, reproduction and production efficiency traits improved with generations. l Season affected milk yield in Frieswal cattle.
