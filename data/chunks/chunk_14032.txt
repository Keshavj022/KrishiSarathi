 This structured methodology ensures consistency in capturing and analyzing key metrics from each study, thereby providing a solid foundation for the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis Plots To understand heterogeneity, various plots are used. A forest plot displays the estimated effects of each study along with confidence intervals, while a funnel plot helps identify publication bias by showing the relationship between study size and effect size (Lauren Elizabeth Griffith 2009) [13]. Methods for Pooling Estimates Two main models are used to pool estimates: the fixed effects model and the random effects model. • Fixed Effects Model: The fixed effects model assumes a common effect size across all studies, meaning that any observed differences between studies are attributed to sampling error rather than actual variability. Estimates are combined by calculating a weighted average, where the weights are based on the precision of each study’s estimate (Broeze et al. 2010) [5]. The weight for the study is determined by: • Here, represents the standard error of the effect size for the study, indicating that more precise estimates are given greater weight in the combined effect size. • The standard error of the overall effect size is calculated as: • The heterogeneity across studies is assessed using the statistic, calculated as: Where is the effect size for the study, and is the overall effect size estimate. • The statistic follows a chi-square distribution with (k - 1) degrees of freedom, where k is the number of studies included in the meta-analysis. This test provides insight into whether the observed variability across studies is greater than what would be expected by chance alone.

Unlike the fixed effects model, which assumes a common effect size, the random effects model incorporates this variability into the pooled estimate (Bravo-Ureta et al. 2007) [4]. The pooled estimate under the random effects model is given by: Here, is the pooled estimate, represents the effect size for the study, and the weights are calculated similarly to the fixed effects model but adjusted to account for between-study variability. The heterogeneity statistic is estimated as: Where Q is the heterogeneity statistic, k is the number of studies, and quantifies the degree of variability across studies. If is less than (k - 1), it is set to zero. In this model, the weights are adjusted to reflect both within-study precision and between-study variability: The pooled estimate under the random effects model is then calculated as: Model Selection The choice between the fixed effects and random effects models is guided by the p-value of the heterogeneity statistic. If the p-value is greater than 0.
