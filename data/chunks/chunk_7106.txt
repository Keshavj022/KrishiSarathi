 Firstly, a diagnostic survey was done to identify farmers’ choice, resource availability, demand in the local market and compatible enterprises. The results of the IFS model (2017–21) showed that pigeonpea intercropped in cotton (6:2 ratio) in one- acre recorded seed-cotton yield of 823 kg and pigeonpea grain yield of 152 kg. In another one-acre area, soybean was cultivated in kharif, followed by chickpea + mustard during the rabi season. Soybean produced 864 kg grain yield, while, in rabi 1,060 kg chickpea and 75 kg mustard were harvested. The remaining area (0.5 acre) was allocated to goatery, vegetables, fruits, water-harvesting pond and fodder unit. Goatary (Usmanabadi) unit of size 9+1 could earn a net return of ` 15,812 with an employment generation of 120 man-days. A poultry (Giriraja) unit with 100 birds in two batches, realized a net profit of ` 65,614 over the year. The horticulture component in IFS yielded a net profit of ` 29,134. This component included fruits (custard apple, papaya) and vegetables (French bean, bhindi, tomato, gourd group vegetable). Overall, one-ha IFS model produced 70.2 q/ha cotton-equivalent yield with a B:C ratio of 1.95. In one year, 3,020 kg feed, 1,590 kg fodder, and 2.50 tonnes manure were produced in the system and were used as input for different enterprises. Water harvested in 20×20 m2 pond was used for life-saving irrigation in rabi and vegetable crops. The ICAR-CICR IFS model for 1 ha, could generate 492 man-days during the one- year cropping season. CROP MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 75 Pusa Decomposer— A microbial consortium for in situ paddy straw management Pusa Decomposer is a microbial consortium of fungi developed by IARI for accelerated degradation of paddy straw into manure in 20–25 days. This technology is an effective eco-friendly solution for agri-residue management and an alternative to burning, thereby decreasing air pollution and improving soil health. A standard operating protocol (SOP) has also been developed for in situ management of agri-residue. The protocol involves application of the Pusa Decomposer spray, followed by rotavator for proper mixing of the spray with the straw and light irrigation to ensure moisture in the field. During 2020, Pusa Decomposer was demonstrated in an area of about 13,420 ha in different states of the country including Delhi. In 2021, the Pusa Decomposer shall be applied to > 15 lakh acres in the four states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.
