 For 2016-17, demonstrations (77,500) were planned on important pulse crops. During rabi 2015-16, yield of chickpea was 14.93 q/ha, lentil 10.50 q/ha, field pea 18.65 q/ha, mung bean 10.24 q/ha, urd bean 7.50 q/ha and rajmash 14.78 q/ha. These yield gains were significantly higher i.e., 54.23, 69.96, 55.54, 30.44, 38.88% and 46.62%, respectively, for above crops over farmers’ practices. Pulses seed hubs (97) are also being established at KVKs for producing quality seeds in participatory mode involving farmers with effective processing and storage facilities. Demonstrations on climate resilient technologies Under the Technology Demonstration component of National Innovation in Climate Resilient Agriculture, 98,504 farmers were covered in 151 villages of 121 districts. Integrated packages of proven technologies were demonstrated in at least one village of every selected district for adaptation and mitigation of the crop and livestock production system to climate vulnerability. During the reported year, 121 KVKs carried out 31,354 demonstrations on natural resource management covering 8,728 ha; 17,261 demonstrations on crop production technologies covering 4,696 ha and 8,728 demonstrations on fodder and feed production covering 1,006 ha area. Besides, 41,265 animals/birds Commercial nursery raising of onion: A viable option for Doon Valley Realizing the importance of onion crop in Doon Valley, the KVK, Dehra Dun produced about 18 q seedlings and supplied to the farmers of three tribal blocks of Dehra Dun during the last year. This particular variety gave up to 340 q/ha yields on the farmers’ fields. Its keeping quality was also very good as compared to local varieties. The bulb size, compactness and pungency content were also widely acceptable to the farmers. About 100 ha area was covered under Agri-found Light Red variety in Doon Valley with the intervention of KVK, Dehra Dun. Gradually, Agri-found Light Red variety has been popular in several districts of Uttarakhand as a potential variety for commercial-seedling raising. The technique of nursery raised under poly-tunnel has also attracted the attention of farmers. Farmers are raising good quality nursery of onion and other vegetable crops and getting premium price from the vegetable production and nursery. Capitalizing the fragrance of Jasmine in Maharashtra Floriculture or Fulsheti, has emerged as an alternative source of livelihood for small- and marginal-farmers of Palghar district of Maharashtra over the years. The income from floriculture, however, was very low due to fragmented land holdings and poor management practices followed. An improved jasmine cultivation model which included fertilizer management, spraying of water soluble fertilizer and low cost drip irrigation system in place of flood irrigation was demonstrated. The floriculture model gained quick acceptance by the tribal farmers because of low resource requirement, ease of management and good access to markets.
