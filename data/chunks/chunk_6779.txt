Resistant to root knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita). Betel vine INGR 21076 Rolling leaves Promising Germplasm Accessions Identified Longan: Five genotypes of longan promising for fruit size (8.1 – 8.5 g/fruit) namely Lg-16, Lg-23, Lg-27, Lg-62 and Lg-94 were identified. Of these, maximum pulp content (76.47%) was recorded in Lg-62 while other had pulp content lower than the average (71.9%). Four identified genotypes namely, Lg-16, Lg-23, Lg-27 Genetic Resources icar annual report 2022-23 87 and Lg-62 had high TSS content (20.1°B) more than the average while only Lg-94 recorded TSS lower than the average.

DIB-1: Basil (Ocimum basilicum) has upward leaf folding with severe puckering and rich in methyl eugenol content (30%). DOGr-2: Clove basil (Ocimum gratissimum) has narrow ovate leaf and rich in β-copaene (20.48%) and α-Bergamotene (15.23%) contents. Mushroom: A total of 175 fungal mushroom accessions were identified up to genus level and 30 up to species level.
