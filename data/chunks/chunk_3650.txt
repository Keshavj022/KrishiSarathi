Major components under MM-I are supply of quality seed and planting material, technology assessment, refinement and standardization, On-farm demonstrations and training. Mini Mission II: Production and Productivity – Coordinated by Department of Agriculture & Cooperation and implemented by States. This mini mission aims at increasing production and productivity of horticulture crops through adoption of improved technologies. Mini Mission III: Post-harvest management and Marketing - Coordinated by Department of Agriculture & Cooperation; implemented by Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI) and National Horticulture Board (NHB). This Mini Mission aims for efficient post-harvest management technologies which includes development of On-farm handling units, cold storage facilities, efficient transport and creation of marketing linkage.
