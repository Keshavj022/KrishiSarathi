Use of Clayey Salty Soils and its Composite Derivatives for Construction and Ceramics for Household Use in the Thar Desert in India Amrita Kaurwar, Raj K Satankar, Lovelesh Dave, Sandeep Gupta, Jerry Oomen, Mohammad Sharey, Suyog Bodhankar, and Anand K Plappally, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, Jodhpur, India r 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Introduction Soil is a valued commodity for use in household construction in rural Rajasthan, India (Niroumand et al., 2013). Soil and carbonaceous material blends have been used in the manufacture of ceramics for water storage and cooking (Roux, 2015). The skills to cast clayey soils and spin wheel are vital in cruse manufacturing. These cruse are manufactured from local soil, small pebbles and organic material such as wood waste, donkey dung etc. (Roux, 2015). Cruse manufacturing can be traced back to the Mesolithic period in this region. The importance to pottery, settlements and domestication of animals towards the west of the Vindhyas in India were observed during this period (Agrawal, 2007).
