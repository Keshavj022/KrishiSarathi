 However, signiﬁcant variation in disease severity was observed among the isolates. Speciﬁcally, P. schmitthenneri, P. palmivora, P. plurivora, and P. acerina exhibited the highest virulence, with disease severity ranging from 75% to 100%. In contrast, the remaining species were less aggressive, inducing moderate disease symptoms with severity levels between 50% and 68%. These ﬁndings are consistent with those of Linaldeddu et al. [20], who reported that the degree of aggressiveness can vary signiﬁcantly among diﬀerent species. Much evidence suggests that the primary cause of olive decline is excessive irrigation, as such conditions provide the high moisture required by these pathogens for their proliferation. Moist environments promote the production of sporangia, as well as the dissemination of zoospores [26,70]. Consistently with this hypothesis, Moein et al. [71] demonstrated that higher irrigation regimes signiﬁcantly increased disease severity in apple saplings inoculated with P. ultimum, P. irregulare, or P. cactorum. Consequently, it can be concluded that irrigation practices may have facilitated infections caused by oomycetes in olive orchards, also acting as the inoculum vehicle of these oomycetes [72]. The management of root rot diseases caused by pathogenic oomycetes remains a signiﬁcant challenge for farmers. Thus, enhancing our knowledge of the Phytophthora and Pythium s.l. species responsible for root rot and the environmental factors inﬂuencing disease development is crucial for eﬀective control strategies. Currently, no curative methods exist to eliminate this devastating disease once it has been established in an orchard. Therefore, an integrated management approach that combines sanitation, the regulation of irrigation practices, the use of biological control agents, chemical treatments, and resistant varieties has been reported as the most eﬀective method for combating root rot disease [73–77]. 5. Conclusions The ﬁndings of our study enhance our understanding of the biodiversity and pathogenicity of Phytophthora and Pythium s.l. species associated with root rot disease in Moroccan olive groves. Ten species were identiﬁed, including seven Phytophthora and three Pythium s.l. species, demonstrating signiﬁcant variation in their virulence. These ﬁndings highlight the complexity of the disease etiology, as multiple species can induce similar symptoms, complicating diagnosis and management. The discovery of several Phytophthora and Pythium s.l. species in Moroccan olive groves is particularly concerning, as it underscores the potential emergence and spread of these invasive pathogens. This warrants further research to explore the full diversity of oomycete communities in olive-growing systems, evaluate their host speciﬁcity, geographic distribution, and survival strategies, and investigate the environmental factors driving their emergence and dissemination.
