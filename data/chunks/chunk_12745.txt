   Lease policy- Leaseholders exploit the water bodies as much as possible but they are least bothered about making any improvement. Most of the rivers and other water bodies are deficient of nutrients which adversely affected the growth of fish.   Recurrent floods- it damage the dikes and pond boundaries farmers hesitate for making any fresh investment.   Poor extension services- Dept. employs each Fishery Officer for 14-15 Gram Panchayats without any proper vehicle facilities in rural areas, so they are unable to do their job properly.   Less awareness and training among the fish farmers on scientific fish culture.   Tripura soil is acidic in nature. To do fish culture, therefore heavy liming is requires in ponds which poor farmers find unaffordable.   Poor water quality and seasonal nature of ponds 555 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022   Socio-economic issues- Low purchasing power of fish farmers regulates their ability to procure and use balanced fish feed in the ponds. In addition, the frequent poaching and poisoning of fish ponds by miscreants further restrict their investment options and willingness.   Narrow profit margin- The farmers are often unable to get competitive price and return of their produce due to unregulated and fragmented markets. Further, the cost of fish feed takes away the major share of the gross return. It is widening the socio- economic gaps, and as a result, younger generation is least interested to adopt this program. 5. Potential for Development of Horticulture, Livestock, Fisheries, Agro-forestry and Postharvesting etc.: The natural resources and the geographical strengths of the state must judiciously be exploited to uplift the agrarian economy and improve livelihood security by doubling the farmers’ income and creating gainful employments. The promising sectors includes natural gas for power, fertilizers and agro-chemicals; plenty rainfall for irrigation, hilly lands for tea, rubber, horticulture and plantation crops; suitable agro-climate for round the year cultivation; border trade with Bangladesh, Agri-eco-tourism, agri-processing industries. 27.2 Strategy and action plan for enhancing production, cost reduction, quality improvement, generating additional income Natural Resource Management Developmental issue:   Watershed development: For holistic development of the state, 997 nos of micro watershed covering an area of 10.365 lakh ha, i.e. the state`s entire geographical area, has been identified by the concerned line department based on drainage course under the Integrated Watershed Management Programme (Now Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna-Watershed Development Component). However, till 2015-16, developmental work has been initiated in 204 nos of micro watershed covering an area of 2.13 lakh ha. That is about 80% area is yet to be covered under comprehensive soil and water conservation programme.
