 It is used for sugarcane planting, intercultural operations, earthing-up, puddling, seed-drilling and land preparation. Basically the equipment is a three-row sugarcane cutter-planter. Any tractor (35-hp or more) can be used to operate it. It has following improved features: (i) the operator need not hold the cane while planting; (ii) power transmission system has been drastically simplified; (iii) it needs minimum head land; (iv) furrowers (not ridgers) open the furrows; (v) curved blades cut the cane by shear action; (vi) canes are cut at 65° for smooth cutting; (vii) length of the setts remains uniform, (viii) sett placement pattern remains same, irrespective of the tractor and the gear in operation, and (ix) best weight distribution. All sub-operations of cane planting are performed simultaneously, without any loss of setts and soil moisture. An area of one hectare can be planted in 3.5–4.0 hr with the help of six persons, including tractor-driver. This equipment is able to meter optimum seed rate of cane. CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 43 over cane planting after harvest of wheat and berseem (81.1 and 108.9 tonnes/ha). Urdbean-toria-sugarcane-ratoon-wheat and rice-berseem-sugarcane-ratoon-wheat systems have revealed that inclusion of berseem in crop sequence has ameliorative effect on the soil physical properties, leading to higher cane yield (73.7 tonnes/ha) and water-use (0.84 tonnes/ha/cm). To characterize indigenous Acetobacter diazotrophicus isolates, 16s r-RNA probe was used. IS 100, 107, 111, 112, 113, 120 and 121 were confirmed positive, and were designated as A. diazotrophicus. Isolate IS 100 has been found the best. These isolates can be exploited as biofertilizers in fields. Cane maturants Dinitrocifrol (8 kg/ha) and Triacontanol (5 litre/ha) through irrigation water in the first fortnight of September improved sugarcane juice quality attributes. Spraying freshly harvested canes with 10 ppm Dithiocarbamate + 1% sodium metasilicate and mixing 10 ppm of Benzalkonium chloride in the primary juice, suppressed acid invertase, dextran-sucrase activity and dextran formation per se. Crop Protection Non-conventional plant-based insecticides neem (10,000 ppm at 0.3%) and annona 20 EC (0.2 and 0.1%) were effective against black-bug and whitefly. Insecticides, Acephate (0.05%) and Karate (0.03%) showed highest toxicity against black-bug, followed by Endosulfan (0.05%), Polytrin (0.03%) and Carina (0.05%). Strain B of sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) significantly reduced cane yield by 13.6, 10.7 and 11.2% of CoPant 90223, CoS 767 and CoLK 8102. JUTE AND ALLIED FIBRES Crop Improvement For understanding the lignification process of secondary phloem fibre cells of jute, an induced (50 kR) mutant of Corchorus capsularis (var. JRC 212) has been l Identified an induced mutant of Corchorus capsularis (var. JRC 212) for understanding lignification process of secondary phloem fibre cells of jute.
