The Interest Subvention Scheme will continue for one year and it will be implemented by NABARD and RBI.  In order to give relief to small and marginal farmers who would have to borrow at 9% for the post harvest storage of their produce, the Central Government has approved an interest subvention of 2% i.e an effective interest rate of 7% for loans upto 6 months. Subvention (incentive) for prompt repayment will not be available to the farmers for loans extended against NWRs. 16 3.2.3 Interest subvention for relief to farmers affected by natural calamities:  To provide relief to the farmers affected by Natural Calamities, the interest subvention of 2% will be provided to Banks for the first year on the restructured amount.
