) popularly known as tur or arhar is one of the major pulses of the tropics and subtropics endowed with several unique characteristics. It is the most versatile legume crop with diversified uses. viz. food, feed, fodder and fuel. It is the fourth most important pulse crop in the world with almost all production confining to developing countries. It finds an important place in the farming system adopted by small farmers in many developing countries. In India, pigeonpea or redgram occupies an acreage of 5.05 million ha with a productivity of 859 kg/ha and production of 4.34 million tonnes. India contributed to 77.61% of the global pigeonpea production during 2020. In India, Uttar Pradesh is the leading producer (0.47 million tonnes from 0.49 million ha with a productivity of 944 kg/ha) contributing to 34.87% of the national production (Fourth advanced estimates, DES, MoAF&W, 2022) followed by Madhya Pradesh (0.44 Indian Farming 74 (03): 80-84; March 2024 Indian Farming 74 (03): 80-84; March 2024 Transplanting in redgram for resource effective crop production to unleash the potential yield Sunilkumar N M'*, Jyothi Kamthane’', Ningadalli Mallikarjun', Gnyandev Bulla’, S B Goudappa?, B T Rayudu? and V Venkatasubramanian?® TICAR-Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Bidar, Karnataka 585 402 ?Directorate of Extension, University of Agricultural Sciences, Raichur, Karnataka 584 104 3/CAR-Agricultural Technology Application Research Institute, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560 024 In India, redgramor pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) is predominantly cultivated in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Odisha, Chattisgarh, and Tamil Nadu. It is one of the major pulse crops in Northern Karnataka, covering approximately 5.14 lakh ha with a production of 2.42 lakh tonnes (766 kg/ha). Bidar district, known as the pulse bowl of Karnataka, accounts for a significant share of redgram cultivation, spanning 65,642 ha. However, dry land cultivation of redgram faces various agronomic challenges and inefficient water management, leading to diminishing productivity amidst water scarcity and rainfall uncertainty. Addressing these challenges, ICAR-KVK, Bidar initiated a trial on redgram transplanting after collaborative discussions with progressive farmers and scientists in 2004-05, yielding promising results. Subsequently, ICAR-KVK, Bidar conducted various activities like on-farm trials (OFTs), frontline demonstrations (FLDs), capacity-building programs, and farm advisory services. Through FLDs, redgram transplanting technology was standardized, achieving an average seed yield of 29.70 quintals/ha and net income of ¥ 1,07,240/ha compared to traditional practices, with an average yield of 17.5 quintals/ha and net income of ¥58,500/ha during 2009-10 to 2014-15. Adoption of transplanting technology resulted in yield increases ranging from 69.71% to 138% compared to traditional practices.
