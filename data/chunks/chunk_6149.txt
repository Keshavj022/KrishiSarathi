, control, application of parso leaf @ 100 kg/ha and application of carbofuran @ 0.75 kg a.i./ha. About 30-day-old seedlings of rice variety IET 4786 (Shatabdi) were transplanted on 27 July 2004 in plots measuring 5 x 3 m at a spacing of 20 x 15 cm. The crop was manured with N: P: K @ 80:50:50. Gallfly infestation was first recorded on the crop at 35 days after transplanting and only single application of the treatments was done at 40 days after transplanting of seedlings. The number of gallfly-infested tillers (silver shoots) was recorded from all the hills of 0.5 m2 area from two locations per plot. The number of tillers were also recorded. The plots were observed regularly at 10 days interval starting from 15 days after transplanting (DAT) for the presence of silver shoots. The infestation was first observed on 35 DAT and treatments were given on 40 DAT. Then the last observation was taken on 60 DAT. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Results obtained during 2003-2004 showed that when the crop was not given any treatment, i.e. in the control plot, the infestation of gall-midge (% of the silver shoot) increased from 6% at 30 days after transplanting (DAT) to 9.8% at 60 DAT. In parso leaf application, the intensity of infestation was reduced from 3.2% at 30 DAT to 2.1 % at 45 DAT and finally to 2.0% at 60 DAT. In carbofuran application, the infestation was reduced from 4% at 30 DAT to 2.0% at 60 DAT. Mean data of the results obtained during kharif 2003-04 and 2004-05 at village Deori (Ranchi) are presented in Table 1. The pre-treatment data (at 25 DAT) show that all the treatment plots had more or less equal extent of infestation, ranging from 10.1 to 10.9%. At successive dates of observation, the control plot (T1) showed a regular increase in infestation percentage, i.e. from 10.1 at 25 DAT to 14.8 at 45 DAT with a mean value of 12.3 during this period. The treatment T2 showed a decline in infestation from 10.9 at 25 DAT to 4.2 at 45 DAT. Application of parso leaves @ 100 kg/ha, showed greater decline in infestation from 10.8 at 25 DAT to 3.6 at 45 DAT and thus proving to be superior to T2, i.e. when parso leaves were applied @ 50 kg/ha. The greatest decline in pest infestation was recorded in carbofuran application (T4), where the infestation decreased from 10.6% at 25 DAT to 3.1% at 45 DAT. Data presented in Table 2 show the decrease in infestation percentage at 45 DAT over the respective values at 25 DAT. T( shows an increase of 116.6%. All other treatments showed decrease in infestation percentage, with the lowest (84.9%) in T2 and the highest (92.0%) in T4. Contents PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT Table 2. Decrease/increase in infestation over 25 DAT at Ranchi (mean of 2003 and 2004) Data presented on Table 3 show the extent of control of gall-midge infestation compared with the control (T1). At 30 DAT, treatment T2 shows 42.9% control followed by T3 (52.4%) and the highest in T4 (71.4%). The same trend was observed at 45 DAT.
