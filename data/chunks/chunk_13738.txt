 India is a country that is mostly dependent on monsoon rainfall for agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness [4]. The value of accurate prediction of rainfall trends is very high in the dynamics of this country. For many years, researchers utilized different kinds of forecasting techniques to bring improvements in rainfall predictions. There are some traditional methods of weather forecasting but these old methods struggle a lot to forecast the climate change patterns of India [5]. The advancements in technology the way of forecasting rainfall patterns in India by introducing advanced machine learning (ML) and soft computing techniques. Both traditional statistical methods and advanced machine learning techniques offer distinct advantages and challenges. The major focus of the literature review is to reviewing the key methods that are employed for rainfall forecasting in India and shedding light on their relevance to different dynamics such as agriculture, water resource management and disaster preparedness, as well as this section also discusses their advantages and limitations in the matter of addressing the complexities faced by India in accurately forecasting the rainfall trends. 2.1. Traditional Statistical Methods Traditional statistical models include the likes of Linear Regression, ARIMA, and Statistical Down- scaling, which have been the backbone of rainfall forecasting for a long time [6]. Each one of the techniques has its strengths and limitations. It is very important to acknowledge their strengths and limitations to exactly predict the patterns of rainfall in India. Traditional estimation strategies perform well in simple forecasting scenarios, however sometimes fall short while handling the non-linearity and complexity of rainfall patterns in one-of-a-kind regions of India [7]. 2.3.Machine Learning Techniques Some of the efficient Machine Learning methods are ANNs, SVM, and Decision Trees, which are applied to predicting rain patterns in India. This is because these methods are effective at capturing complex nonlinear relationships from large data sets. Besides the merits of Machine Learning methods in the prediction of rain patterns, several important limitations prevent these methods from reaching their capacity. Machine learning models are well-known for providing significant improvements in accuracy compared to traditional statistical methods. Complex relationships among precipitation and climate variables along with temperature and wind pace can be evolved which can be hard for conventional numerical forecasting strategies [8]. Moreover, these methods require careful maintenance and processing of large amounts of data to function effectively. 2.4. Soft Computing Techniques Fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and hybrid procedures are examples of some simple computational strategies that provide flexible and scalable models for managing uncertainty in climate information.
