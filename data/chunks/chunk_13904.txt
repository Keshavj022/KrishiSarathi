 This in- creased microbial activity enhances the decomposition of organic materials, leading to the formation of stable hu- mus, a significant component of SOC. The carbon stored in soils through organic amendments can remain seques- tered for decades or even centuries, depending on soil management practices. To enhance the effectiveness of organic farming, it’s crucial to identify suitable crops, spe- cific locations supported by customized policies aligned with carbon farming opportunities and action plans. The Special issue 2024] DRYLAND AGRICULTURE OF INDIA : CROPPING PRACTICES AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION S47 regions where use of chemical inputs is low holds the po- tential to be converted into organically certified area. Biochar, a form of carbon-rich charcoal produced from biomass, is a particularly effective soil amendment for carbon sequestration. When applied to soils, biochar can enhance SOC levels and improve soil properties, such as pH balance, water retention, and nutrient availability. Biochar is highly stable, meaning that the carbon it con- tains is less likely to be released back into the atmosphere as CO2. Integration of biochar with fertilizer reduced N2O (~ by 18%) and CH4 (~ by 25%) emissions in medium tex- tured soils, and lowest level of emissions were recorded in alkaline soils after biochar application (Iqbal et al., 2023). Biochar increases SOC levels and acts as a powerful tool for mitigating climate change. Moreover, by improving soil structure and increasing organic matter content, or- ganic amendments enhance the soil’s ability to retain wa- ter, which can reduce the need for irrigation. This leads to lower energy use for water pumping and further reduces the carbon footprint of agricultural practices. Conservation agriculture Conservation agriculture (CA) offers a promising ap- proach to reducing the environmental footprint in the drylands of India, where agriculture is often constrained by water scarcity, soil degradation, and erratic climate patterns. In these regions, conventional farming practices have led to extensive soil erosion, depletion of organic matter, and unsustainable use of water resources. CA, which integrates principles such as minimal soil distur- bance, permanent soil cover, and diversified cropping sys- tems (Das et al., 2021, Das et al., 2023), offers a sustain- able approach to these challenges. One of the primary benefits of CA is the reduction in soil degradation, particu- larly soil erosion. By adopting zero-till or reduced-till practices, CA helps maintain soil structure and enhances organic carbon levels, crucial for soil fertility (Das et al., 2018). Soil water conservation is another critical aspect of CA. The practice of maintaining permanent soil cover, either through crop residues or cover crops, improves water infiltration and decreases evaporation, thereby en- hancing water use efficiency (Das et al., 2020).
