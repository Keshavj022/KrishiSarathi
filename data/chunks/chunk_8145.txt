 The response of pearl millet, wheat and mungbean to the potassium through this organo-mineral fertilizer (OMF) has been evaluated and found comparable to that of conventional potassium fertilizer—muriate of potash. Halophilic plant growth promoters: Application of liquid bio-formulations ‘Halo-Azo’ and ‘Halo-PSB’ on growth and yield of wheat and rice under sodic soils (pH 9.4) were tested. In wheat, seed inoculation with halophilic nitrogen fixers (Halo-Azo, and Halo- Azsp) and P solubilizers (Halo-PSB) resulted in ~21% increase in plant height and ~17–25% increase in root length over control. Wheat grain yield increased by 14.2, 10.9 and 17.9% in Halo-Azo, Halo-PSB and Halo-Azsp treatments, respectively, over control. However, consortia of halophilic strains resulted in an increase of 21.8% in grain yield over control. In case of rice, grain and straw yields increased by 18.6 and 24.9% respectively in consortia treated pots over control. Integrated nutrient management in sapota under agro-forestry system: Eight-year-old plants of sapota cv. Kalipatti were subjected to 17 treatment combinations consisting of inorganic fertilizers (1000:500:500 g NPK/plant), organic manures (vermicompost 10 kg and farmyard manure 50 kg/ plant) and bio-fertilizers (Azotobacter, Azospirillum and PSB @ 250 g/plant). Integrated Nutrient Management package comprising 750:375:375 NPK + 50 kg FYM + 250 g Azospirillum + 250 g Azotobacter/ plant performed markedly better with an yield of 29.03 kg/plant and 4.54 tonnes/ha. The treatment recorded maximum net return of ` 58,575/ha with a B:C ratio of 1.82. ❑ Metagenomic studies of mangrove sediments Mangrove areas are considered as repository of valuable microbes. Metagenomic DNA was isolated from soil samples of mangrove and non-mangrove ecosystem. In mangrove soil, Pseudomonas, Alcanivorax, Desulfovibrio, Escherichia, Geobacter, Nitrosomonas, Paracoccus and Shewanella showed greater abundance. In non-mangrove soil, Dechloromonas, Deinococcus, Methylibium, Nitrobacter, Rhodoferax were abundant. A significant correlation for relative abundance of probiotics bacteria between mangrove and non-mangrove samples was observed.
