 It can be sown in the month of February-March in the low land areas for double cropping where water is abundantly available.   Direct seeded rice can be taken up in areas experiencing of shortage of labour for transplanting of rice with seed rate 80-100 kg/ha.   In direct seeded rice 3 to 8 days after sowing Pritilachlor 175g mixed with 25 kg of sand and apply to the field with enough moisture. Crops at 15-20 days after planting Chlorimuron+ Metsulfuron methyl (Almix) 15 grams in 200 litres of water and uniformly spray with hand sprayer to control broad leaved weeds, sedges and grasses.   CAUR-4 can be taken up in semi deep water ecosystem as it is resistant to flood and also for paddy cum fish culture.   For transplanted rice, seed rate of 40-60 kg/ha should be taken up at a spacing of 20cmx20cm. Closer spacing (15cm x 15cm or 10cm x 10cm) may be used as it is advantageous when weed control is inadequate.   Pre- sowing seed treatment with Carbendazim 50WP@2g/Kg seeds or with Captan @ 2g/Kg of seeds or with Trichoderma viride @5g/Kg of seeds 24 hrs before sowing is recommended to protect from soil borne diseases. In wet seed treatment, the seeds are to be treated with Carbendazim 50WP @2g/litre of water for 1 Kg of seeds for 10 hours and drain the excess water.   Top dressing of urea @55kg/ha can be done when the pre-Kharif rice crops attend maximum tillering stage. Since the pre-Kharif rice varieties are of short duration, they will flower very soon and farmers should be ready for erection of scare crows, installation of glittering tapes, colourful ribbon/plastic in their fields for driving away the birds.   Apply 130 kg/ha urea in three splits i.e. 65 kg/ha urea at the time of planting, 32.5 kg/ha at active tillering stage and 32.5 kg/ha at 7 days ahead of Panicle Initiation (PI)stage.   Apply 250 kg/ha SSP at sowing time or 15 days before sowing and 50 kg/ha Potash in two splits i.e. 25 kg/ha at sowing time and 25 kg at 7 days ahead of PI stage.   Raise Azolla as a dual crop by inoculating 250 kg/ha 3-5 DAT and then incorporate during weeding for the wet season crop. Azolla is a good biofertilizer that not only add organic matter in the field but also supplies enough N to the rice crops. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 92   For seed production of rice, the field size should be atleast one hectare and should be compact. The variety planted in the last year should be same, Only 1 seedling/hill should be maintained. Rouging should be done frequently at least 4 times (nursery, tillering, pre flowering, flowering etc.) Isolation distance of 3m from other varieties should be maintained. Management Cultural method   Remove collateral weed hosts from bunds   Use only disease free seedlings   Avoid excess nitrogen Chemical Method   Spray Tricyclazole 75 WP @ 500g/ha after observing initial infection of the disease.
