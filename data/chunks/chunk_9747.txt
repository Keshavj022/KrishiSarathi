 Efficacy studies provide evidence that the Indian Farming 73 (01): 30-32; January 2023 Indian Farming 31 January 2023 consumption of grains from biofortified varieties would provide bioavailable Fe to meet a fully recommended daily allowance (RDA) in children, adult men and 80% of the RDA in women. Biofortification prioritization in breeding However, the commercially released cultivars have low levels of Fe and Zn, though they have been improved for yield significantly over the landraces. Hence concerted efforts were made to breed for high Fe and Zn cultivars with good yield levels to address the food and nutrient needs of the resource poor population, since the entire breeding efforts of the public and private sector were geared towards hybrid development for higher grain yield owing to the availability of the cytoplasmic male- sterility system. The ICAR has endorsed the inclusion of the minimum levels of Fe and Zn that have to be bred into future varieties of pearl millet across the country. The All-India Coordinated Research Project on Pearl Millet decided on a minimum of 42 mg/kg of Fe and 32 mg/kg of Zn content. It is expected that the farmers may prefer cultivation of biofortified hybrids due to high nutrition in addition to higher grain and stover yields. Biofortified varieties Initially, the world first high-Fe pearl millet variety ‘Dhanashakti’ was developed by utilizing the intra- population variability within ICTP 8203, which is an early-maturing, large-seeded, disease resistant and high-yielding open-pollinated variety that has been under cultivation in India since 1990. Dhanashakti is officially released and notified by Central Variety Releasing Committee in 2014 for the cultivation in all pearl millet growing states of India. Based on national testing trials, Dhanashakti had 71 mg/kg Fe (9% higher) and 2.2 t/ha grain yield (11% higher) compared to the original ICTP 8203. Hybrids of pearl millet with higher grain yield and high levels of Fe (>70–75 mg/kg) and Zn (>35–40 mg/kg) densities have been developed and released in India. Currently, India is growing >70,000 ha of biofortified pearl millet. Biofortified hybrids The first set of biofortified hybrids was AHB 1200 Fe and HHB 299, officially released at national level for A and B zones in collaboration with the agricultural universities of Maharashtra (VNMKV) and Haryana (CCSHAU) during 2018. These biofortified hybrids contained 73–77 mg/kg Fe and 39–41 mg/kg Zn. They are medium maturing having more than 3 t/ha of grain yield and 7 t/ha of fodder yield (Table 1). Apart from this, ‘Phule Mahashakthi’ was released for the state of Maharashtra. The second set of hybrids was officially released at national level during 2019–20. The RHB 233, RHB 234, AHB 1269, HHB 311 were released in collaboration with agricultural universities of Rajasthan (SKNAU), Maharashtra (VNMKV) and Haryana (CCSHAU). These biofortified hybrids contained 83–91 mg/kg Fe and 39– 46 mg/kg Zn.
