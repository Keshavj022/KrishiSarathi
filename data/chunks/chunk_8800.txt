Genetic purity of aromatic rice Pusa Basmati has been tested. Sixty-one aromatic rice cultivars have been fingerprinted using 55 non-linked microsatellite markers. Forty-eight bread-wheat cultivars have been analysed with 22 most informative Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) primer pairs. Capsule variability in mesta (Hibiscus cannabinus), collected from the north-coastal region of Andhra Pradesh GERMPLASM REGISTERED Oryza sativa (6), Triticum aestivum (6), Hordeum vulgare (3), Ricinus communis (2), Solanum tuberosum (1), Trigonella foenum-graecum (2), Sesbania rostrata (1), Cajanus cajan (7), Ziziphus mauritiana (3), Vigna aconitifolia (1), Arachis hypogaea (4), Citrullus lanatus (2), Gly- cine max (1), Crotalaria juncea (1), Coffea arabica (6), Papaver somniferum (1), Brassica napus (2), Brassica juncea (1) High-yielding and long-podded cowpea, collected from Mandi (Himachal Pradesh) DNA MARKERS REVEAL NARROW GENETIC BASE OF THE LATEST MUNGBEAN AND TOMATO CULTIVARS Diversity in mungbean and tomato (using DNA markers) has revealed that their modern Indian cultivars are genetically very similar. This finding calls for a shift in breeding strategies, towards greater use of germplasm collections available with breeders and in genebanks. CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 15 Pulses: AFLP profiling of 32 released cultivars of mungbean has been completed using six most informative AFLP primer pairs. Twenty-three chickpea accessions and 14 released cultivars analysed with 78 RAPD primers have revealed low genetic diversity among them. Oilseeds: Forty-eight sesame cultivars profiled with selected 21 RAPD primers have showed high degree of similarity. Fibre crops: Higher polymorphism was noted in diploids when 7 diploid and 25 tetraploid cotton cultivars were fingerprinted using 26 RAPD primers. Vegetable crops: Thirty-eight accessions of chillies fingerprinted with 6 AFLP primers could be distinguished independently by each of the primers. Horticultural crops: Eighteen cashew accessions analysed with 6 selected AFLP primer pairs have showed high degree of polymorphism. Twenty-four mango cultivars with 6 inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers and 15 AFLP primers, and 240 Indian banana and plantain accessions with nine selected AFLP primer pairs have been fingerprinted.
