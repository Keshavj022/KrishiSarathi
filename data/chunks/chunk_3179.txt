 A list is given below (Annexure‐I): Hybrids:‐ High yielding hybrids have been developed for conventional as well as non‐traditional cropping systems, viz., Buland, Sheetal, HM‐5, JH 10655, Malvya Makka Hybrid 2, COH(M)‐4, HM‐ 8, HM‐9, NECH‐128, HM‐4 (medium maturity), PEH‐5, DH 115, Vivek‐15, Vivek‐17, Vivek 25, Vivek 27. Medium and late maturity hybrids have also proved highly successfully for cultivation during rabi season. Early and extra early maturing hybrids are good for spring season. 48 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science HM – 9 HM ‐ 8 A major breakthrough has been achieved by developing high quality protein maize (QPM) hybrids which have covered large area throughout the country viz., HQPM‐1, HQPM‐5 across the country, Shaktiman 3, Shaktiman 4 for Bihar and BQPH 12 for Andhra Pradesh. www icar org in 49 2002 ‐ 2007 HQPM ‐ 5 HM‐4 has excelled as the best hybrid for baby corn production throughout the country. VL78 for baby corn and Win yellow sweet corn varieties are also popular. HM 4 (Baby Corn) Composites:‐ Gujrat Makka‐6, Narmada Moti, Javahar Makka 216, PratapMakka4, Pragati, Azad Kamal, Shalimar ‐1, Shalimar‐2, Birsa Vikas Makka‐2 have been released for various agro climatic conditions where hybrid seed is not available easily. Germplasm lines registered Thirty four Inbreds and two gene‐pools for different favorable traits like productivity, disease resistance, drought / cold tolerance and good combining ability, have been registered in NBPGR for their use in hybrid breeding program as follows (Annexure‐II): 50 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science BPTTI‐28, BPTTI‐32, BPTTI‐34, BPTTI‐35, BPTTI‐37, BPTTI‐38, BPTTI‐44, BML‐2, BML‐3, BML‐5, BML‐ 6, BML‐7, BML‐8, BML‐11, BML‐14, BML15, BML‐20, BML‐22, HKI‐ 209, HKI‐335, HKI‐1025, HKI‐323‐ 8, HKI‐1040‐7, HKI‐1105, HKI‐1348‐2, HKI‐1352‐58‐9, HKI‐1354, HKI‐295, HKI‐586, HKI‐1344, HKI‐ 1332, MS Pool C‐4, Tux Pool C‐4. H HKI ‐ 1105 Heterotic pools developed: 12 Heterotic Pool were developed as a long‐term strategy to extract inbred lines Disease resistance Sources: Apart from the lines registered with NBPGR, 33 multiple disease resistant inbred lines were also identified. Sources of resistance to major diseases were identified for their use in resistant cultivar development program as per the number in parentheses: TLB (53), Polysora rust (49), PFSR (5), BLSB (3), MLB, SDM Package of practices for different maize‐growing regions have been developed. These include production technologies for cultivation of baby corn, sweet corn and maize based cropping system. Technology for transplanting during winter has been developed. This has been profitably adopted by farmers after harvest of late‐sown paddy and early sugarcane crops. Winter maize cultivation in rice wheat cropping system to help eradicate Phalaris minor, and in eastern states to replace wheat crop which suffers due to rising temperature.
