 However, if the shift from conventional to organic is conﬁned to rainfed, hilly and tribal areas, there will be an increase in both consumer and producer surplus.

Introduction Conventional input-intensive and agro-chemical-based agriculture has improved yields and addressed food security issues globally through the green revolution since the 1960s. However, the continued, imbalanced and often overuse of chemical pesticides and fertilizers has affected the environment and health of human beings [1]. Therefore, the demand for non-chemical-based and organic agricultural products has increased over the Sustainability 2022, 14, 15057. https://doi.org/10.3390/su142215057 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability Sustainability 2022, 14, 15057 2 of 22 years. During the past decade, the demand for organic products has grown at 16% per annum [2–6]. Further, rising costs of chemical inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides, and increased demand for Non-Genetically Modiﬁed Organisms (Non-GMO) foods are also pulling farmers toward organic and environmentally friendly agriculture [1,7–9]. According to the FAO, organic agriculture is a system that relies on ecosystem management rather than external agricultural inputs such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides [10]. However, at the policy level, apprehensions have been raised on the efﬁcacy of organic farming in feeding the vast population, particularly in densely populated nations such as in South Asia given the effect on yield, cost of production per unit quantity of agricultural products and farm proﬁtability [11]. The recent food security constraints in Sri Lanka due to the shift to organic agriculture have further accentuated the fear [12]. Many studies have reported a reduction in crop yields to a signiﬁcant extent due to organic farming [13], and some studies have reported an increase in the variability in crop yields [14]. Some other studies have pointed out that because of the low yields in organic agriculture, there is a need for more land for agriculture by diverting forest land to meet the food demand [15], which will negatively impact the environment. However, despite lower yields, premium prices received by organic farmers are one way to increase the proﬁtability of small and marginal landholding farmers with less than one hectare of cultivated land, as in the case of India and China [16,17]. Some studies have also pointed out that gains of organic agriculture in terms of increased farm-level biodiversity, organic matter and organic carbon content in the soil more than compensate for the losses due to lower yields through enhancing sustainability [11]. Thus, there is a wide divergence of opinions about the costs and beneﬁts of organic agriculture.
