 Production of fruits shoulders a larger prominence in hills of Himalayas. People owing to nutritional security prefer natural fruits produced from woody perennials. Pecans are rich in micronutrients, have phenolic compounds and its consumption is beneficial to health. In recent days, horticultural produce has opened new doors for income. However, technical know-how of management practices, viz. soil, irrigation, etc. is imperative for fruit crops cultivation. Pecans provide long-term returns starting production from eighth year with optimum production from fifteenth year. Hence, the extension of pecan nut cultivation technique is imperative for successful production management. The sapling’s production and management and input supply for the establishment of orchards is very essential for its expansion. Nutraceutical and nutritional properties The nuts of pecan and other parts such as leaves, bark, etc. have several nutraceuticals and pharmaceutical properties and helps in treatment of numerous illness, viz. cardiovascular disease, improve digestive system, anti-inflammatory, bone and teeth, weight loss, blood pressure, improve immune system, helps in skin problems, anti-ageing, reduce hair loss and anti-cancerous. The nutritional value of nut is given in Table 1. Plant description The pecan [Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch] is native to North America, a member of Juglandaceae family. It was introduced in India around 1930 in Himachal Pradesh. It grows well in fertile, profound and well-drained soils. It is deciduous in nature, leaves are alternate, in length up to 45 cm, and composed of up to Pecan: A potential fruit crop for Indian Himalayas Globally, in the last decade, production of nut fruit crops have grown at a steady pace reaching ~5.4 million metric tonnes in 2022-23 according to International Nut and Dried Fruit Council (INC). United States of America was the top tree nut producer with 40% share, whereas India contributed only 3.5%. Pecan nut contributed 3% of the total tree nut production and in the last half decade, pecan growing trends displayed significant linear increments of 16,465 MT/year. In terms of estimated global tree nut consumption in 2021, almonds (31%) and walnuts (21%) accounted for half the total, while pecans made up 3%. Supply value of tree nut crops increased over the previous 10 years including pecans from $0.92 billion in 2012-13 to 2.05 billion in 2022-23.
