 The major strategies for increasing the productivity of sugarcane include: Use of quality planting material of suitable varieties, promoting single node seedling technology with recommended package of practices to reduce seed and planting cost, adoption of drip irrigation for judicious use of irrigation water, soil health management through liberal application of organic manures, growing green manures crops, mechanization to overcome labour problem, adoption of integrated pest and disease management practices for management of pests and diseases. Promotion of intercropping with short duration legumes/vegetables has the potential of generating additional income leading to investments in sugarcane cultivation for productivity enhancement and increased profitability. A number of intercrops in sugarcane were evaluated by RARS, Anakapalle by adopting paired row planting method (120 x 60 cm). Few intercrops that showed promise and potential for up scaling are given in table below along with net returns and BC ratio.

There are 20 districts in Arunachal Pradesh which can be classified into four agro-ecological zones namely, Alpine, Temperate, Sub-Tropical and Tropical zones. Tropical Zone with high rain-fall and humidity, warm temperature ranges from 22-36 degree C in summer and 10-25 degree in winter and elevation range of up to 900 m above MSL. Sub-Tropical Zone with moderate rainfall and humidity, cool temperature is ranges from 15-30 degree C in summer and 14-21 in winter and elevation range 900-1800 m above MSL. Temperate Zone with less rainfall, cool temperature ranges from 0-22 degree Centigrade and elevation ranging from 1801 m to 3500 m MSL. Alpine Zone essentially cool temperature from 0-20 degree Centigrade with snow-fall and elevation above 3500 m above MSL. The total population of the state is 1.38 million (Census 2011) with population density of 17 persons km2. The main occupation of the people is agriculture and livestock rearing. Therefore, agriculture and allied sectors primarily drives the economy of the state and nearly 75% of the state’s total workforce is engaged in agriculture and allied services. Main crops which are grown in the state are rice, maize, millets, wheat, pulses, sugarcane, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables and spices.
