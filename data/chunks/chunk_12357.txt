In terms of the way forward the following points are worth considering:   Nearly seventy-three per cent of North Bihar is affected by floods and 33 per cent of South Bihar receives less than 750 mm of rainfall, making the southern part of the state drought prone. There is need to increase investment in flood management in North Bihar and watershed management and rain water harvesting in south Bihar.
