 plastic mulching, inline drippers, in situ mulching with oil palm fronds, were compared with drip and microjet systems under different levels of deficit irrigation in oil palm plantations. Among different treatments, water usage per each kg of FFB was very high under microjet irrigation. Plastic mulching with 50% water requirement used minimal water per kg FFB produced. However, plastic mulching could save 25% water with higher sustainability index both under drip and inline dripper system of irrigation. Lowest sustainability index was recorded under microjet irrigation without in situ mulching followed by microjet irrigation with in situ mulching. DRIS indices and critical leaf nutrient concentrations developed for oil palm plantations: The DRIS indices for Nellore district are -4.38, 2.03, 2.93, 1.32 and -2.24 for Nitrogen, P, K, Mg and B respectively. Nitrogen (N)>B>Mg>P>K is the order of importance of nutrients in oil palm growing regions of Nellore district. Nitrogen and Boron are the most critical nutrients in oil palm growing soils of Nellore district. Cashewnut production management: Eight principal growth stages including the critical stages for vulnerability to pest attack were identified in cashew as per extended BBCH scale. It is recommended to prune 25% lateral shoots during the month of mid-September for obtaining high yield in cashew variety Bhaskara under west coast conditions of Karnataka. It was found that a 20-year-old plantation of cashew on a highly weathered lateritic soil can sequester biomass carbon in the range of 42.93 to 50.41 MgCha which is equivalent to 157.56 to 184.99 Mgha of CO2 equivalents. The total sequestration of carbon in the top 60 cm layer of soil of a 20-year-old cashew plantation ranged from 99.52 to 104.61 Mgha. During the 20th year of the plantation, the contribution of soil to the total sequestered carbon was 2 to 2.3 times of biomass carbon. Under a highly weathered environment, trees such as cashew further supplement the carbon sequestration capabilities of the soil. Coconut-based Integrated Farming System (CBIFS) including banana and pepper as intercrops along with dairy, poultry and goatery realized a net Crop Management CISH Decomposer icar annual report 2022-23 103 return of 6,53,853 from a unit area of one hectare. The C:B ratio for this system was 2.08 indicating it as a successful model for coconut farmers to adopt. Groundnut (var. Girnar 2 and 3) was grown successfully as intercrop in coconut plantation. Application of 50% RDF + vermicompost @ 10 t/ha recorded higher pod yield of 2297 and 2092 kg/ha for G3 and G2 variety, respectively. The spacing dimensions of 0.6 m Ã— 1.2 m was found to yield the best quill yield of 632 kg/ha from 290 cinnamon plants cultivated as intercrop in coconut.
