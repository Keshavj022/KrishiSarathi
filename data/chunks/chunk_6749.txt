Horticulture A total of 122 varieties of horticultural crops comprising of fruits (15), plantation crops (1), vegetable crops (97), potato and tropical tuber crops (2) and spices (7) were notified by the Central Sub-Committee on Crop Standards for Cultivation under different agroclimatic conditions of India. Following improved varieties of horticultural crops were identified for multilocation trial and recommendation for notification at National level. Fruit Crops Bael: CISH B-3 is a mid-season maturing, seedling selection with thin shell, nearly thorn less, pulp is dark yellow with pleasant flavour and less mucilage content. Fruit weight is 1.15 kg with 65.64 kg fruit yield per tree (5-year old). Fruits have 38.04°B TSS, 0.44% acidity, 17.49% total sugars and 86.19% pulp. Narendera Bael 11 (NB-11) ia an early maturing variety suitable for processing. Fruits have whitish yellow pulp with 33.98 °Brix TSS and ascorbic acid (35.15 mg/100 g of pulp). Fruit weight is 1.87 kg with 99.6 kg/tree productivity. Banana: Popoulu (AAB, Plantain) is a high yielding (57.06 t/ha) and dual purpose (dessert & as chips making) with 32.5 % chips recovery and tolerant to pseudostem weevil, Eumusae leaf spot and identified for cultivation in Karnataka, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Asom, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal. Kaveri Vaamana (TBM -9) is a dwarf mutant developed by irradiating the shoot tips of cultivar Grand Nain. The plant height is 150-160 cm with bunch bearing 8-10 hands weighing 18–25 kg. This dwarf variety doesn’t require propping/staking which reduces the cultivation cost by 10-15%. Kaveri Kanchan (NCR 17) is a stable, high yielding dessert banana hybrid (Nendran x Rose). This hybrid contains higher Pro-vitamin A (10 to 40 fold) than popular dessert banana cultivars like Red Banana, Grand Nain and Rasthali. It is highly resistant to Fusarium wilt pathogen (Fusarium oxysporum f sp. cubense Race 1) and yielding 20% higher than its parent (cv. Nendran). The fruits have superior, sweet taste (a blend of the Grand Naine taste and Nendran flavour) with higher consumer acceptability. Custard apple: Thar Amrit has 320.12 g fruit weight with 24 kg/plant productivity. Fruits have high pulp content (63.58%). The fruit pulp has TSS 29.
