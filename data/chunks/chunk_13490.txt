For the HCA, the Ward’s method with squared Euclidean distances was employed (Murtagh and Legendre, 2014; Mondal and Sarkar, 2021). This method is based on the error sum of squares (ESS) with the following objective equation (Ward, 1963; Mondal and Sarkar, 2021): 2 2 2 1 1 1 ESS ( ) n n i i x x n = = = − ∑ ∑ , (4) where ESS is the error sum of squares; x denotes the score of the ith individual. Squared Euclidean distance was calculated using the following equation: S. DAS, et al.: Spatio-temporal variation and relationship between agricultural...

Before conducting the cluster analysis, both the simulated and real datasets during 2004–2005 and 2018–2019 were standardized using the Z-normalization method suggested by Rujasiri and Chomtee (2009) and Cupak et al. (2019). Furthermore, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was performed to evaluate the equality of means, following the approach outlined by Mondal and Sarkar (2021).
