 This made overall collection of 4,56,568 accessions in National Genebank and 12,076 accessions in Cryo-Genebank. yy Germplasm registered: Total 215 genetic stocks of 37 crop species were registered for economically important traits, and 13 genes of economic importance were cloned and characterized. yy Good agriculture practices: Developed 56 production, protection and post-harvest technologies and good agriculture practices (GAPs). yy Export promotion: ICAR Basmati rice varieties accounted 99.5% of total export of Basmati rice (~Rs. 30,000 crore) while wheat varieties (HD 2967, HD 3086, HD 3226, DBW 187) accounted for around 3.0 million ton of export (~Rs. 6,000 crore). Sugarcane variety Co-0238 has contributed towards sugar production of around 1.84 million ton and export worth Rs. 11,297 crore. 3 DARE–ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2021-22 yy Grafting of commercial varieties of grapes in dogridge rootstock has enabled grape cultivation in saline and alkaline soil conditions in Maharashtra and Karnataka. It has resulted in better yield (5-10%) and quality berries, but reduction in cost of cultivation (10-15%) and total water requirement have ultimately led to higher profits. At present, nearly 90% of grape area (1.25 lakh ha) is on this rootstock. Since adoption of the technology, the direct total economic surplus/benefits from grape crop has been estimated to the tune of Rs. 1,721.6 crores during 2021-22 (at 2018 prices). yy Pomegranate variety Phule Bhagwa released in 2003-04 has been adopted in more than 86.1 per cent area under the crop in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It was due to higher yield, lesser susceptibility to fruit spots and thrips, better desirable fruit characters Grape veriety 'Thompson seedless' in dogridge rootstock Pomegranate var. Phule Bhagwa 4 DARE–ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2021-22 (aril, colour and size), and better keeping quality (15-25 days at ambient conditions). Since release of the variety, unprecedented increase in area (123%), production (280%), productivity (70%) and export (380%) were observed. The direct total annual economic benefit/surplus from variety Phule Bhagwa has been estimated at Rs.9,617 crores for 2021-22 (at 2018 prices). yy Potato variety ‘Kufri Pukhraj’ is one of the most popular short-duration varieties in North Indian Plains and presently covering more than 80% of total potato area in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Assam, and Orissa and about 33% of the total potato area in the country. This variety is realizing 15 % higher yield and ~15% less cost of cultivation due to savings on disease management over the check variety Kufri Jyoti. The annual economic surplus during the year 2021-22 has been estimated to the tune of Rs 4,729.0 crores (at 2018 prices).
