 Hence, there is a need to support the farmers by providing improved quality of poultry birds for augmenting rural poultry production to fulfil the deficiency gap in both poultry meat and egg sectors and to make the State self-sufficient. Location specific Dual variety chicken (BND Cross) was developed by ICAR, Tripura Centre by crossing of Coloured Broiler, Tripura Black and Dahlem Red for backyard poultry farming. This newly developed dual type chicken has more egg production (more than 100 eggs/ annum), growth rate and body weight (2-2.5 kg) than native chicken (60-70 eggs/ annum). and well adapted in agroclimatic condition of Tripura. 567 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Directorate on Poultry Research, Hyderabad has developed Vanaraja and Grampriya for backyard poultry farming. These breeds are well accepted in the Tripura condition. Vanaraja and Grampriya have more egg production (more than 160-180 eggs/ annum), growth rate and body weight than native chicken (60-70 eggs/ annum). Fisheries Capture Fisheries   Development of fisheries in open water bodies: Ranching of 7-10 cm quality fish seeds in rivers and rivulets and reservoir as a part of conservation and awareness programme. This will enhance the fish population in the natural water bodies of the state which will lead to enhancement in the capture fish production of the state.   Development of community based approach for cage and pen culture in the open water bodies:   Better management practices should be enforced in the reservoir with intervention of appropriate stocking density, effective number of fishers, suitable candidate species, etc.   Short term seasonal fish culture can be popularized in the seasonal open water bodies available in the state.   Capacity building of fisher folk community on–a) scientific way of culture based fisheries in open water areas and big water bodies; b) sustainable and judicial fishing methods and optimum mesh size use   Inclusion of women in fisheries activities through Self-help groups: Women community of the fisher community can be encouraged to take part in activities like fishing net fabrication and marketing activities. Culture Fisheries: Doubling Farmers Income in Culture Fisheries of Tripura: Fish is an important constituent in the diet of 95% population of Tripura. In spite of having sufficient aqua-resources which constitute 2.02% of the total geographical area of the State, the fish production of Tripura is much below the requirement. This necessitates its import from other parts of the country and drain-out of state funds. There is scope for enhancing fish production of Tripura in order to doubling the income of the farmers through either bringing down the cost of production or increasing the profitability. Following are some strategies in this context:   Reclamation of depleted water bodies to enlarge effective area for fish cultivation.
