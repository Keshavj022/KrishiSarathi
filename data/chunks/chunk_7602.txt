 Financial support was also provided for strengthening, renovation and modernization of student hostels, laboratories, DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 IV examination halls and smart classrooms to various AUs. An android app called KISAAN-Krishi Integrated Solution for Agri Apps Navigation, which provides an integrated interface for more than 110 apps in agriculture and allied areas developed by ICAR institutions, was launched. National level Cluster Frontline Demonstrations (CFLDs) on Pulses were initiated to demonstrate the production potential of new pulses varieties and the related technologies. During the year, 39,648.14 q seed of pigeonpea, blackgram, greengram, lentil, chickpea, field pea and lathyrus was produced and made available to farmers. Capacity development of 1.16 lakh extension personnel was carried out through 3,948 courses in the country. ICAR awards were given in 21 different categories to 150 awardees, comprising 101 scientists, 8 administrative personnel, 3 journalists and 20 farmers. MoUs and Workplans for Cooperation in the field of Agricultural Research and Education were signed between ICAR and several international organizations. The DARE/ICAR has made significant progress during the year 2019 and continuously working on several innovative plans to facilitate agricultural research and technology development for the benefit of Indian farmers. I hope the DARE/ICAR Annual Report 2019– 20 will provide useful information to the diverse stakeholders and prove to be a helpful compilation for planning future programmes for agriculture research and education in India.
