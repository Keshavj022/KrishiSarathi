 However the Cry protein expression was recorded 4-6 IJIl even after 130 ~ays of plant growth. Table: 21. Cumulative data of Cry protein expression In leaves at different stages of plant growth (l'I!g of fresh leaf total protein).

Did you inform the results to your seniors? Provide details. Yes, the results were presented / discussed dUring the monthly meetings and IRe. - - - 10. How many genotypes were taken for transfer of cry lAc from BN Bt? Sixty one genotypes from different cotton growing regions of the country were selected for conversion. 11. What were the tests performed for the detection of cry lAc during transfer? Elisa kits and Dip sticks were used. 12. What was the segregation pattern of cry lAc during backcrossing? 50:50 13. Was this material also tested for the presence of MON 531 event? If yes, when was the presence of MON 531 conveyed to your seniors? Give details. No. 14. What is the present status of this material? The material is in various stages of backcross (BC 2 to BC 4F3). 15. We understand that some quantity of BN Bt seed was sent to UAS Dharwad during 2008 for taking seed production? Where and how much seed was produced? What was the quantity of seed sent to UAS Dharwad? BN Bt seed was not sent to Dharwad. The seed which was receiv.ed from Dharwad itself was sent back without opening the packet and was delivered by hand. 16. Did you observe any variation/~ation for morphological traits during seed multiplication? The seed was not multiplied at Nagpur. 17. Were you also involved in the packing and sale of BN Bt? No. Dr. V.V. Singh and Dr. P.R. Vijayakumari were involved in seed packing 18. Old you raise any trials to know the performance of BN Bt and Bt NHH 44 at eleR? If yes, in which year and what was the source of seed? What was the performance of BN Bt and Bt NHH 44 In these trials? Yes. RCGM trial was conducted in 2006-{)7 to test the performance of BN Bt and NHH 44 Bt. TIie seed was received from Dharwad. The performance of BN Bt and NHH 44 Bt was better than their non Bt counterpart as well as the local check varieties and hybrids. 19. There are some reports from elCR about the presence of MON 531 In the transformed BN? Were you aware of that, if so, when did you know of that? Did somebqdy inform you take action? Iwas not aware of the presence of MON 531 in the transformed BN as it was never discussed in any meetings.
