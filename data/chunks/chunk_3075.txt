 • At Kerala, root activity patterns in two year old Acacia mangium as affected by planting density and pruning were evaluated using 32P tracer soil injection method. Higher root activity was observed at 25 cm lateral distance and 30 cm soil depth for trees planted at 2x1 m spacing while widely spaced trees (1250 trees ha‐1) showed extensive root spread beyond 75 cm lateral distance. • At Bangalore, the yield traits of Simarouba were recorded from randomly selected 10 plants from two varieties. The variety Gowri has recorded higher number of 46 bunches per tree, number of clusters per bunch (7.8) compared to Kaali variety. • At Kattupakkam centre, in one acre of farmer field, turmeric was raised as mono crop and in another field of same area turmeric was integrated with Sesbania sesban as agrisilvi system. After 4 months of establishment, goat was integrated by feeding Sesbania sesban leaves at 40‐50% of its requirement. Due to frequent pruning of Sesbania leaves for fodder purposes, there was no reduction in the light intensity and also due to the nitrogen fixing ability of the sesbania it could enable to retain the nitrogen content of the soil. Turmeric ‐ Sesbania sesban agrisilvi system yielded 5.447 t fresh fodder and hold 50‐60 young growing goat or sheep per hectare and was able to support 101g daily weight gain without any concentrate feed supplementation. Additional income through animal integration and sale of sesbania pole was Rs. 36,900 ha‐1. www.icar.org.in 27 2002‐2007 All India Coordinated Research Project on Cropping Systems 1.

Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years): Research achievements of AICRP on Cropping Systems 2003‐2004 System based production technologies for improving resource use efficiencies: • At Ludhiana, new emerging maize‐potato‐onion system followed by maize‐potato‐moong was identified in place of predominant rice‐wheat system. At Pantnagar, rice‐vegetable pea‐ greengram emerged out to be new cropping system in place of rice‐wheat. At Faizabad, potato‐greengram proved to be must remunerative one. Zero tillage advanced the saving time of wheat. At Jorhat, winter rice‐potato‐autumn rice turned out to be most profitable cropping system. At Kota, the highest‐wheat equivalent yield was obtained in soybean‐ wheat when soybean was cross planted with pigeonpea. At Hyderabad, Rajendranagar maize‐green chilli was the profitable sequence. At Palampur, rice‐radish‐potato proved to be the most remunerative and gave Rs 72,709/ha net return during 2002‐03. At Pusa, rice‐ potato+ onion gave maximum net return. At S.K.
