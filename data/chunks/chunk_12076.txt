Target crops and delivery system: It can be delivered as seed treatment, substrate treatment and soil application in capsicum, onion, cabbage, cauliflower, crossandra, roses, gerbera, banana, grapes, guava, acid lime, papaya, tomato and egg plant. 3. Target agro-ecological zones (if any): All 4. Validation and commercialization: The technology has been validated at multiple locations under All India Coordinated Research projects. The product has been tested for its bio-efficacy in three different agro- climatic regions at Karnataka, Odisha and Tamil Nadu for two seasons. 5. Whether licensed to private companies, if yes, details thereof: Yes The technology has been licensed to 110 industrial licensees all over India 6. Benefits: Arka Krishi Vriddhi had exhibited excellent ovicidal and larvicidal activity against root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne spp. and reniform nematode, Rotylenchulus reniformis. It successfully inhibited the growth of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, Sclerotium rolfsii and Fusarium solani. It also exhibited an increase in yield of 14.2 â€“ 19.3% in several horticultural crops. Usage of chemical pesticide can be reduced by 40- 50% with a net saving of Rs.8000 to Rs.12000 per acre. This product serves as a viable option in organic farming systems and integrated nematode/disease management packages. 7.
