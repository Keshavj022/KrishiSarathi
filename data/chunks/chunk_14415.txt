 The trial measured only effects on children 0–23 mo of age and their mothers and families and did not measure effects on the communities as a whole. The trial also did not include other possible short- and long-term consequences for participants, such as improvements in soil quality, micronutrient adequacy, intrahousehold relationships, social support, mental health, or overall wellbeing. In addition, some community members and government frontline health and nutrition care workers were involved in the production of NSA and nutrition-specific videos. The costs of their involvement have not been included here but are likely to have been small and would not have seriously affected the study findings. Third, as is standard practice, the trial was powered to detect differences only in the primary outcomes.

Economic evaluation of UPAVAN trial 2265 in other outcomes, such as household food expenditures and healthcare seeking or utilization may have been due to lack of statistical power rather than lack of effect. Finally, we do not report cost-effectiveness in terms of outcomes commonly used in cost-effectiveness analyses of nutrition interventions (such as DALYs or life-years saved), which limits comparisons with other nutrition interventions.
