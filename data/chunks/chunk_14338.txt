 Though data for the non-rainy season has also been collected, as already mentioned, the Table 2 Summary of Explanatory Variables of Adopters and Non-Adopters.

The value of this index varies from zero to one. It takes the value of one when there is full specialization and approaches to zero when there is full diversification”. The detailed description of the index provided in Datta (2015). 7 We have collected the data on neighbor’s SWC activities from surveyed farmers based on their observation about neighbors on-site SWC adoption ac­ tivities. The enumerators also visited the neighboring fields to cross-check the information provided by surveyed farmers. The detailed description of neigh­ borhood data is provided (Peddi, Dayakar and Kavi Kumar, 2021) which uti­ lized the same data set. 8 Aggregate agricultural profit = [{{(total revnuepaddy-input costpaddy) + (total revnuemaize-input costmaize) + (total revnuecotton-input costcotton)} – annualized SWC implementation cost}/total cultivated area]. The annualized implementation costs of SWC measures have been assessed based on the methodology suggested by Das (2015). P. Dayakar and K.S.
