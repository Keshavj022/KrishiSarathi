171 Observations 8492 8492 8492 2443 5298 4530 3103 2704 Notes: Difference-in-differences regressions. I run the pooled regression in Eq. (8), restricting attention to 𝛿1, the treatment effect on households further away from towns. Outcomes in Columns (1)–(3) are indicators that equal 1 if the household owns a bicycle, a scooter or a mobile phone respectively. Outcomes in Columns (4)–(5) are imputed prices of HYV seeds and fertilizer (Rs./unit) respectively. Outcome in Column (6) is the casual agricultural daily cash wage (Rs./day), measured at the household-member level. Outcomes in Columns (7)–(8) are imputed unit prices of paddy and wheat (Rs./kg) respectively. All regressions include state-year fixed effects. Observations are weighted using 1999 sample weights. Standard errors, clustered at the village level, are reported in parentheses. *𝑝< 0.10, **𝑝< 0.05, ***𝑝< 0.01. as their most important source of information in Appendix Figure A3, and the frequency at which households report changing practices in the past 7 years in Appendix Figure A4. While these results are merely suggestive given the lack of baseline data, the absence of stark differences across treatment and control groups suggests that a change in access to extension workers and traders is not a primary driver of the reduced-form effects. Access to agricultural markets. Improvements in road infrastructure can also lower transport costs of goods and subsequently increase access to input and product markets. To test this hypothesis, I estimate the effects of improved rural road connectivity on the imputed price of high-yielding variety seeds, fertilizer and the cash wage for casual daily agricultural laborers in Table 9.37 I do not find any statistically significant impact on the prices of these farm inputs (columns 4 to 6).38 Next, I estimate effects on the imputed price of the two most commonly grown crops – paddy and wheat – in Table 9. Similarly, I find no detectable impact on the prices of farm outputs (columns 7 and 8). At first glance, this null result on prices appears to be surprising. However, given that improvements in road infrastructure impact both supply and demand – for example, it lowers transport costs for traders supplying seeds as well as for farmers demanding seeds – the effect on output prices is theoretically ambiguous ex-ante.39 The null effect on agricultural cash wages is also consistent with the presence of nominal wage rigidity in markets for casual daily agricultural labor, which has been documented in the rural Indian setting (Kaur, 2019). Access to credit markets. Alternatively, improvements in road in- frastructure can increase access to credit, possibly relaxing liquid- ity constraints faced by farmers (Croppenstedt et al., 2003; Karlan et al., 2014).
