, 2015); hence the lower value for CT suggests that the overall disruption of the SOC pool by land use conversion from virgin forest to CT is more than conversion from forest to CA. The CA land uses show better soil health than CT based on CPI values; hence CA is well land management status. Similarly, a higher CPI value was observed in no tillage (0.91–0.98) than CT (0.88–0.90) in the wheat - soyabean crop­ ping system of south Brazil due to reduced soil disturbance and adoption of suitable crop rotation in NT (de Oliveira Ferreira et al., 2013). Ac­ cording to a study done in maize fields with varying biochar application rates in a continental monsoon climate, the field with the highest application rate (47.25 t ha−1) contained 21.50 g kg−1 SOC, while the field with the lowest application rate (15.75 t ha−1) displayed 15.30 g kg−1 SOC. This was supported by a similar trend in CPI (Yang et al., 2018). 4. Conclusions This study assessed the effect of various land use practices (forest, ZT, RT, and CT) on SOC and TN depth distribution, storage, and stratifica­ tion in the soil profile and, hence, identifying appropriate sustainable Fig. 6. Example of the equivalent soil mass calculation for a given data set in CT, RT, ZT, and forest lands. The numbers in bold represent soil mass (Mg ha−1), and the numbers in parenthesis represent bulk density (Mg m−3). The quantity of soil mass from a deeper layer transferred to the succeeding top layer to obtain an equal soil mass for a particular layer is indicated by the numbers outside the box. Table 2 Storage of SOC and TN under different land use practices (Forest, ZT, RT, and CT). The data present mean ± SD (m = 3). The different uppercase alphabets imply significant differences across treatments for a given soil depth, and the lowercase alphabets imply significant differences across the soil depths for a given treatment (P < 0.05).
