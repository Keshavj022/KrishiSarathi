 Clinical examination: Clinical signs such as dehydration score and faecal consistency were recorded Haemato-biochemical profile: Packed cell volume (PCV), serum total protein, albumin (A), globulin (G), A: G ratio, chloride, sodium and potassium were estimated from the blood samples collected on day 0 and 6 after treatment. CIRG Therapeutic trial: Clinical trial was conducted on 15 goats suffering with diarrhoea. Only the animals found negative for endoparasitic infestation were selected. Bacteriological examination of faecal sample from representative clinical cases showed predominantly Escherichia coli. All the animals were given methanolic extract of urhul flowers @ 50-mg/kg body weight after preparing suspension in gum acacia (5%). This preparation was administrated once daily for 3 consecutive days. The assessment of clinical efficacy was based on revival of appetite, faecal consistency and dehydration status. Haemato-biochemical estimation: Standard methods were used to estimate glucose, albumin, globulin, A:G ratio, aspartate amino transferase activity and creatinin, sodium, potassium and chloride concentrations in the serum samples collected before and 3 days after the treatment. Phyto-chemical analysis: Urhul flowers were collected from local area of Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh and taxonomically identified as Hibiscus rosa-sinensis. After drying the flowers at room temperature, methanolic extract was prepared by Soxhlet assembly as per the standards techniques and concentrated by rotary evaporator. In-vitro antimicrobial activity of juice: Antibiogram study was conducted against E. coli isolated from clinical cases by using different concentrations (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 mg/disc) of urhal extract. The sterile disc (Hi-media) was loaded with these dilutions individually. Control disc, loaded with solvent base was prepared separately. To compare the antimicrobial properties of Table 1.
