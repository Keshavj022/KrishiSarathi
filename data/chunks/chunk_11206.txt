 17 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS Basmati Rice yy For Direct Seeded Rice (DSR)of Basmati: Pusa Basmati 1121, Pusa Basmati 1509, Punjab Basmati 7 and Pusa Basmati 1718 are most suitable varieties. The optimum sowing time for Basmati under DSR is second fortnight of June (15-30 June). yy Apply135 kg urea per hectare in three equal splits at3, 6 and 9 weeks after sowing. Phosphorus and potash should be applied only if the soil test shows deficiency of these nutrients. Skip phosphorus application if recommended dose of phosphorus had been applied to the preceding wheat crop. yy For Basmati varieties like Punjab Basmati 7, 5, 4, 3 and 2, Pusa Basmati 1121, 1637 and 1718, the optimum time of nursery sowing is 1st fortnight of June and transplanting time is 1st fortnight of July whereas, for CSR 30, Basmati 370, Basmati 386, Pusa Basmati 1509, the optimum time of nursery sowing is 2nd fortnight of June and transplanting time is 2nd fortnight of July. yy Seed and seedling treatment is mandatory to control dreaded disease like foot rot. Smear the seeds with talc formulation of Trichoderma harzianum@ 15 g per kgof seed immediately before sowing and seedling rootdip for 6 hrs with T. harzianum @ 15 g per litre of water before transplanting. Seedlings of Basmati varieties are ready for transplanting when theyattain 5 to 6 leaf stage or are 25-30 days old. yy Irrigate the nursery before uprooting and wash them toremove mud. Transplant two seedlings per hill in lines at 20 x 15 cm (33 hills/sq. metre) during the optimum period in a well puddled field. In the late transplanted crop, the spacing may be reduced to 15x15 cm (44 hills/sq. metre) to minimize the reduction in yield. yy Practice green manure before basmati. Do not apply urea if thefield has been green manured with 45-55 days old sunnhemp/dhaincha or summer moong straw has been incorporated after picking of pods. yy Apply fertilizers on soil test and crop rotation basis. Skip phosphorus application if the recommended dose of phosphorus has been 18 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS applied to the preceding wheat crop. Apply 45 kg/ha urea for CSR 30, Basamti 386 and Basmati 370 whereas apply 90 kg/ha urea for varieties like Punjab Basmati 5, 4, 3 & 2 and Pusa Basmati 1121, 1637 & 1718 and apply 135kg/ha for Pusa Basmati 1509. Apply urea in two equal splits at 3 weeks and 6 weeks after transplanting. If possible, apply urea when water is not standing in the field. Irrigate on third day of the application of urea. yy Basmati 386 and Basmati 370 if transplanted too early in the season have a prolonged vegetative phase resulting into a tall and leafy crop. Such a crop is more prone to lodging because of excessive height and vegetative growth. To check lodging, lopping of the upper half of crop canopy (Basmati 386 and Basmati 370) after 45 days of transplanting may be done. Further it would also reduce stem borer damage.
