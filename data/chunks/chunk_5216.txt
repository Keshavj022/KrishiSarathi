 The whole material was pounded for about 2 minutes and the drink was ready for sensory evaluation. Sensory evaluation The sensory evaluation was carried out in Munsiyari for appearance, flavour and consistency in comparison to commercial tea and coffee. The evaluation exercise was done by using a 1–5–point scale as recommended by Amerine et al. (1966) and Meilgaard et al. (1991) with the following descriptors: Like extremely 5 Like moderately 4 Neither like nor dislike 3 Dislike moderately 2 Dislike extremely 1 For each product, 5 ml of the sample at normal temperature (25°C) was dispensed into coded white sensory plastic cups. The cups were coded using random numbers. Assessors were allowed to rinse their mouth after each evaluation. Average scores were considered as overall opinion of the panelists. Extent and coverage Namkeen jya is commonly used by people of high-altitude areas of Uttaranchal hills. The tree, Taxus baccata, which is used as an ingredient, grows in high-altitude areas between 1800–2400 above msl and commonly occurs in patches. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Data presented in Table 1 show that about 80% respondents were the user of namkeen jya. A majority of the people (35%) were daily users. Cold tolerance and taste were the main Table 1. Frequency of using Namkeen jya by locals User Number Percentage Daily 46 35 Weekly 35 27 Occasionally 23 18 Non-users 26 20 Table 2.

It is evident from the data presented in Table 4 that appearance of the namkeen jya was found to be better than of tea but inferior to that of than coffee. Thus the appearance of namkeen jya is fairly good. The results of sensory evaluation show that the flavour of namkeen jya is better than of coffee and tea (Table 5) and also that of consistency (Table 6). Table 4.
