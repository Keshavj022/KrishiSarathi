0g/kg seed), in the first fortnight of November with recommended doses of fertilizers and irrigation and one spray of Indofil M‐45 (0.25%) on disease initiation resulted in yield increment upto 7.0 q/ha and Rs.8.373 incremental return in disease prone areas. LINSEED BUD FLY RESISTANT/TOLERANT VARIETIES AND HOST PLANT SOURCES : Bud fly (D. lini) is the key pest in Gangetic plains, control and peninsular regions of the country. Variety : Neela Germplasm :A‐95B, EC‐1392, EC‐1424, GS‐234, IC‐15888, JRF‐5, LCK‐88062, LMS‐109‐2K Chemical control of bud fly : Two fortnight sprays of monocrotophas 36 SL (0.04%) or imidacloprid 200 SL (100 ml/ha) can reduce the bud fly infestation significantly. Biological control of bud fly : Sowing of linseed with recommendation agronomic practices and application of imidacloprid 200 SL (100ml/ha) followed by tobacco leaf extract (0.5%) reduce bud fly infestation with maximum economic return. V BIOCHEMISTRY HCN, polyphenol, sugar content were analysed and found that resistant genotypes against diseases contained higher amount of HCN and polyphenol and low in sugar content. Entries TL‐11, TL‐26, TL‐ 27, TL‐37 and TL‐43 were observed as edible purpose having less than 3% lenolenic acid content in linseed seed with the potential of more than 18 q/ha. FRONT LINE DEMONSTRATION Front line demonstrations conducted during last five years (2001‐02 to 2005‐06) concluded that improved technologies applied in whole package increased the linseed yield on an average by 198% under irrigated, 83% under rainfed and 114% under utera conditions as compared to local practices. www.icar.org.in 14 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science All India Coordinated Research Project on Rapeseed‐Mustard 1.

Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): Crop Improvement • 25 rapeseed‐mustard varieties (19 Indian Mustard; 2 Gobhi Sarson and 1 each of Karan Rai, Toria, Yellow Sarson and Black Mustard) were released. • Twenty‐three mori based experimental hybrids have been tested under multi‐location programme. • 462.14 q breeder seed have also been produced against the indent of 110.69 q. Crop Production • Basal application of 40 kg S/ha+thiourea(0.1%) spray at pre‐flowering stage has recorded maximum seed yield of mustard in zone II (North‐Eastern parts of Rajasthan) and zone III (in tarai region of Uttaranchal) and hence recommended for getting remunerative yield of mustard in these zones. • Integrated nutrient management practices i.e.
