 Network studies in general indicated the superiority of different grades in increasing crop yields. Amongst the foliar grades, Grade – II (for Fe deficient soils) and Grade – IV (For Zn and Fe deficient soils) were found more effective in most of the crops of various groups viz., cereals (maize, sorghum, bajri and wheat), vegetables (potato, cabbage okra) and pulse like pigeon pea. The soil application Grade–V was also found more useful in oilseed like castor and mustard and found equally effective with foliar Grades–II and IV to cereals crops (Table 7,1 ). Further, the general foliar grade (Grade – I) was also found effective in paddy and summer groundnut.

In case of vegetables, potato tuber yield was increased by 8190 kg ha‐1 equivalent to 22.6 % increase over control (362.5 q ha‐1) due to foliar grade–III .The multi micronutrient grades have also been found beneficial in www.icar.org.in 69 2002‐2007 increasing yield of oilseeds. The maximum increase was due to soil application of grade‐ V to the tune of 579 kg ha‐1 over control (2091kg ha‐1) in castor .The increase in pigeon pea grain yield was by 436 kg ha‐1 due to grade – IV over control (1250 kg ha‐1). These grades were also found effective in fodder crops viz. maize and sorghum .Thus, the use of multi micronutrient mixture foliar grade‐IV at the rate of 1 % and soil application Grade–V @ 20 kg ha‐1 have shown their usefulness in increasing yield of different crops in soils of Gujarat. 8.3 . Phytoremediation and Critical toxic concentrations in soil and plant tissues • Studies to evaluate efficacy of different crop species for phytoremediation of cadmium contaminated soil indicated that spinach and marigold showed higher tolerance to Cd accumulation as compared to fenugreek and ladyfinger. Among the crop species tested, spinach appears to be the best for remediation of Cd contaminated soils although marigold merits attention because of its non‐consumable nature.
