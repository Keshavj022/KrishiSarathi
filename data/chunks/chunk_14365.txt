 The basal soil respiration as affected by different nutrient management treatments in paddy soil in year 2019–2020 at Active tillering (AT), Panicle initiation (PI) and Harvest (HA) growth stages of rice plant grown in controlled environment experiment. *LSD represents Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (p = 0.05) among the treatments indicated by different colour bars. farming on electricity (e.g., for irrigation), which results in more demand for power from thermal power plants (Source: Census and Economic Information Center data). In India, the total cropped area has increased between 2005 and 2015 leading to an increase in the total farm power availability from 1.50 kW/ha in 2005 to 1.94 kW/ha in 2012 (Figure S4). The share of electric motor is also increasing, due to which the electricity consumption in agriculture has grown at 5.63% (CAGR) from 2009 to 2018 (Source: State of Indian Agriculture 2017–18). As per EDGAR data the electricity and heat production emitting around 54% more CO2 into the atmosphere in 2018 as compared to 2009. The total energy consumption in India has also increased by about 50% during the last decade, making it the fifth largest energy consumer globally by using about 4.4% of the world’s total energy (Source: US Energy Information Administration data). Apart from these, India is the second largest cement producer in the world and accounted for over 8% of the global installed capacity as of 2019. This also suggests the demand for building farm infrastructures and storage facilities for maintaining the cold chain to market. The cement production in India has increased from 186 MMT in FY (Financial Year) 2009 to 337 MMT in FY 2019 (Source: Indiastat.com). There is around 36% increase in CO2 emissions from cement production in India between 2009 and 2018. Therefore, all these factors are responsible for the increasing trends of CO2 concentration in India during the past decades. 3.4. Soil respiration and paddy crop yield as affected by different nutrient management strategies The terrestrial exchange of carbon plays a vital role in regulating the global carbon cycle in the biosphere (Barichivich et al., 2013; Forkel et al., 2016; Graven et al., 2013). The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is strongly influenced by soil respiration and vegetation cover. Soil respiration acts as a key process in the total carbon flow to the atmosphere thus, influencing global carbon cycle and is primarily regulated by microbial activity (Schlesinger and Andrews, 2000). Therefore, modification of soil respiration may alter atmospheric CO2 concentration at a global scale (Schlesinger and Andrews, 2000). Furthermore, soil respiration (which is the CO2 produced by the biological activity of soil organisms), is the major flux within the global carbon cycle, emitting about ten times more CO2 to the atmosphere annually than fossil fuel combustion (Bond-Lamberty and Thomson, 2010).
