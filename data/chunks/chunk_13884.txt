 Validation of this method according to the SANTE guidelines for pesticide analysis showed a linearity of over 0.99 and recovery rates between 93 and 102 %. Precision and accuracy were both below 15 % RSD, with detection and quantiﬁcation limits between 0.0201–0.0697 ng/mL and 0.0609–0.2112 ng/mL, respectively. The detection parameters were determined according to the method described by Kumar et al. (2023). 4.1.3. Estimation of AChE in blood samples The enzyme activity of AChE in blood was measured by reverse-phase high-performance liq- uid chromatography (RP-HPLC), which was developed by Sinha et al. [ 12 ]. A Shimadzu 20AD dual pump system with autoinjector, photodiode array detector and a C18 column (4.6 mm di- ameter, 150 mm length, 4.5 μm particle size) was used for the analysis. The mobile phase was a 55:45 (v/v) mixture of water and acetonitrile with a ﬂow rate of 0.600 mL/min. To determine the AChE level, 10 μL blood was mixed with 280 μL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 10 μL 50 μM 1-naphthol acetate. After a 20-minute incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding 700 μL acetonitrile. The mixture was ﬁltered through a 0.2- μm syringe ﬁlter and the ﬁltrate was analysed for AChE content. The conversion of 1-naphthol acetate to 1-naphthol was used to quantify the AChE activity. The method showed not only high reproducibility, sensitivity and accuracy, but also the abil- ity to determine the enzyme activity within a remarkably short time of 20 minutes. It showed linearity with an R ² > 0.9842, precision within 15 % relative standard deviation (RSD) and ac- curacy between 85.2 % and 99.6 %. The robustness of the method was rigorously validated ac- cording to the guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), ensuring the reliability of the results. The detection parameters were consistent with those described by Sinha et al. (2022). 4.2. Pesticides, DAP metabolites and enzyme AChE activity Table 5 shows the mean concentrations of various pesticides detected in the blood samples of 494 participants, including 341 individuals from the exposed group and 152 from the con- trol group. A total of 28 different pesticides were identiﬁed, categorised into 19 insecticides, 6 herbicides and 3 fungicides. The pesticide concentrations ranged from 0.42 to 45.77 ng/mL. The toxicity levels of these pesticides were assessed according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines 2019 [ 13 ] 11 were categorised as highly hazardous (Class Ib), eight as mod- erately hazardous (Class II) and six as slightly hazardous (Class III). One pesticide was cate- gorised as likely non- acutely hazardous and two pesticides were not classiﬁed. The supple- mentary ﬁle 2 and 3 contains a statistical analysis of various pesticides, DAP metabolites, and AChE activity in both exposed and control participants.
