 In potato, considerable response to rising atmospheric CO2 is expected due to its large below ground sinks for carbon and efficient phloem loading mechanism. CO2 concentration and assimilation are positively correlated in potato. Few adverse effects of elevated CO2 concentration include a reduction in chlorophyll content in leaves, particularly during the later growing season after tuber initiation. Then in the season, leaf photosynthesis is also likely to decrease progressively in the higher CO2 environment due to senescence. Leaf N concentration is reported to deplete faster in the leaves grown under elevated CO2 environment, which further supports the conclusion that leaf senescence gets accelerated in the plants grown under high CO2. The combined effect of temperature change and increased CO2 from simulation studies in India shows that, T.
