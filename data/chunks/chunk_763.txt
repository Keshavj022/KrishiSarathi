These fruits are highly perishable in nature, the marketing of which is a major problem, e.g. custard apple gets spoiled within 2â€“3 days of harvesting. Also with the glut in the market, the prices of these fruits drop down drastically making it uneconomical for the farmers to sustain production; the result is that the farmers uproot the trees owing to low price in the market. To avoid the situation, there is a need to extend shelf-life of these fruits and to develop post-harvest value-addition technologies which are simple and adaptable at the farm level.
