 There was a proclivity to erroneously recommend chickpeas and cotton as kidney beans, and maize respectively in all of the models except for XGBoost (Fig. 07, Fig.S2.1). In the context of HC, all models exhibited misclassification of watermelon as mango and grapes as pomegranate (Fig. 8). The KNN algorithm exhibited misidentification rates of 6.25 % for coconut as orange, 4.54 % for grapes as pomegranate, and 3.22 % for pomegranate as orange, as shown in fig.S2.2c. The results indicate that the recommendations generated by XGBoost-HC (Fig. 8a) and RF-HC (Fig. 8b) outperformed those of the other methods, as illustrated in Fig. 8 and fig.S2.2. The mixed crop model that was combined exhibited a relatively higher rate of misclassification, as evidenced by Fig. 09a-b and Fig.S2.3. For instance, in the mixed crop-RF model, 5.5 % apple and 11 % coconut were misclassified as orange; lentil was misclassified as 10 % moth beans and 3 % mung beans, and 6 % papaya was misclassified as cotton (Fig. 09b). 4. Discussion The selection of suitable plant species for cultivation is contingent upon the soil nutrient availability and the crop’s demand for vital nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK), which are subject to the influence of diverse environmental factors, including soil pH, precipitation, temperature, and humidity. The experience of farmers commonly plays a pivotal role in selecting suitable crops for farming in a given site. However, the growing climate change and the deterioration of soil nutrient levels present significant challenges for farmers, leading to frequent instances of suboptimal decision-making. ML techniques are the most effective tools for providing crop farming recommendations, particularly with regards to the availability of soil nutrients and prevailing weather Table 1 Comparative evaluation of the employed model’s performance.

In the current study, we made an effort to evaluate the robustness of algorithms of ML for agricultural applications using authentic multi-trait field data collected from various locations in India, which was published in a public repository. The study illustrated that an ML-supported decision system, built on a non-mechanistic framework, can effectively suggest cropping across various environments.
