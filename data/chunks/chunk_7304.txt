 Crop improvement: During 2020-21, a total of 172 varieties/hybrids including 17 biofortified varieties were notified and released for commercial cultivation. These high yielding varieties included 62 varieties of cereals, 23 of oilseeds, 33 of pulses, 39 of commercial crops, 15 of forage crops and other crops. Using marker-assisted selection strategy, lipoxygenase-2 free soybean variety NRC 132 was developed and identified for cultivation in Southern and Eastern zones. Two SNP markers linked to wilt resistance in castor variety 48-1 were identified. These markers can be further used in the MAS for development of wilt resistant castor varieties. The miR156 binding site of the Ideal Plant Architecture gene 1(IPA1) was edited through CRISPR/Cas9 technique in Swarna rice. The edited lines showed ~40% increase in number of the spikelet’s per panicle. Cicer microphyllum, a wild relative of C. arietinum, may serve as a source of genes responsible for drought tolerance. During 2019- 20, total breeders seed production in field crops was 115,711.9 q against the indent of 85,752.8 q. The cereal crops had a major share in total breeder seed production. During 2019-20, the total production of quality seeds including all classes was 420,812.6 q against the target of 376,553.0 q. In horticultural crops during this year, a total of 65 improved varieties/hybrids comprising fruits (11), plantation crops (8), vegetables (22), onion (4), garlic (1), potato (9), tropical tubers (2), flowers (1), spices (3), medicinal plant (1) and mushrooms (3) were identified for cultivation in different agro-climatic conditions of India. A total of 258.96 q of Breeder’s seed of 193 varieties and hybrids of different vegetable crops were produced. Further, as a part of technology dissemination, a total of 227.2 q truthful label seeds of 56 varieties/ hybrids of vegetables and 226 q TL seeds of seed spices was produced and distributed to farmers. In pummelo, Arka Chandra and Arka Anantha with high yield and suitable for fresh consumption were developed. Arka Supreme avocado having 370-400 kg fruit yield was developed. Solapur Lal, the first biofortified hybrid pomegranate useful for juice or fresh consumption, was bred. ARI-516 grape, a high yielding, early ripening, evenly maturing hybrid with long, cylindrical, medium sized fruit bunches with 20-22°Brix and musky flavor was developed. Thettu Amalika tamarind was identified for cultivation in semi-arid zone of Andhra Pradesh. The coconut varieties notified were Kalpa Haritha, Kalpa Jyothi, Kalpa Surya and Kalpa Srestha. VTLCP-9 cocoa is a promising hybrid with 3 kg dry beans/tree/year yield and suitable for chocolate industry. Two onion varieties, viz Bhima Subhra and Bhima Safed were registered with PPV&FRA under extant category for their protection.
