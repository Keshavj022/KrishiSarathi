FARM IMPLEMENTS rainfall (90 mm) received during October improved the productivity of tomato in different pickings. The results obtained over the farmers fields indicated that there was significant difference with regard to yield, gross and net returns and B:C ratio between the indigenous intercultural tool (pingali dhanti) and traditional blade harrow (Table 1). There was no significant variation between pingali dhanti and indigenous blade harrow in respect of field capacity, draft and energy at 15 and 45 days after transplanting of rainfed tomato (Table 2). However in combination of hand weeding either with pingali dhanti or blade harrow enhanced the fruit yield of tomato by 13% compared to the interculture implements only (2,164 kg/ha). The operation of the interculture tools beyond 45 days could not be implemented due to severe drought that followed. To verify the fact of feasibility of pingali dhanti, its use more number of times beyond 45 days could not be established during this year. However, the perception of the farmers regarding the performance of pingali dhanti up to 45 days was collected by the group of the farmers while operating the tool in the farmer's fields (Table 3). The conclusions derived from the focus group interactions are: pingali dhanti is superior to traditional blade harrow in terms of coverage, extended period of operation during the crop growth period and high effect on controlling of weeds, easy in handling, cost effectiveness, durability and replicability of the implement. The traditional blade harrow has edge over indigenous tool in terms of the cost, availability and ease in fabrication. CONCLUSION The draught power and energy requirement of pingali dhanti is within the limit of power available from an average pair of draught animals. The work rate and weeding efficiency observed for the pingali dhanti are comparable with those of blade harrow.
