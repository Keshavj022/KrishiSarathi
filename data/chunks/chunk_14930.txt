 The utilization of catalytic reforming of biomass pyrolysis oil for hydrogen production has been recognized as a viable strategy, with fast biomass decomposition, feedstock flexibility, and adaptability to local conditions [84,85]. India could enhance its hydrogen production capacities by leveraging advancements in biomass pyrolysis and catalytic reforming. 7.5 Biomass pyrolysis Challenges for hydrogen production in India The biomass pyrolysis process for hydrogen production in India has several challenges that require extensive research with customized solutions. The main challenge is to ensure a regular and reliable supply of biomass feedstock from agriculture and forestry. Proper controls and different feedstocks are needed to reduce product variation. Developing an efficient pyrolysis technology tailored to Indian biomass resources presents significant challenges. This requires optimizing the reactor design, operating conditions, and catalysts to increase hydrogen production. Evaluating these innovations from laboratory research to commercial applications poses significant commercial challenges [86]. Considering the financial sustainability of biomass pyrolysis for hydrogen production demands an extensive analysis of investment costs, operational expenses, and market efficiency. Overcoming cost challenges and maintaining a balance with existing hydrogen technologies is important to encourage market acceptance and wider adoption. Establishing support systems, incentives, and regulatory frameworks is important to encourage investment, foster innovation, and support the development of biomass pyrolysis. Clear and consistent guidelines on feedstock supply, carbon emission pricing, and renewable energy incentives can encourage industry participants to invest in biomass pyrolysis projects. By addressing these challenges through a comprehensive and coordinated approach, India can fully leverage biomass pyrolysis for hydrogen production and advance its sustainable energy goals. 7.5.1 Infrastructure Challenges The development of bioenergy projects is often hindered by inadequate infrastructure. Poor road networks and transportation systems can increase project costs and logistical difficulties [87,88]. Additionally, many rural areas may lack electricity, limiting industrial growth and bioenergy adoption. A shortage of essential infrastructure, such as waste management and water supply systems, further complicates the establishment of bioenergy industries. Efficient transport infrastructure is also crucial for delivering bioenergy products to markets. Landlocked countries face higher costs and logistical challenges in exporting bioenergy products, while even those with deep seaports may require significant investment in specialized facilities for handling, storing, and transporting bio-based fuels, such as pellets. 7.5.2 Cost Challenges The cost of feedstock has been identified as a major barrier to bioenergy production.
