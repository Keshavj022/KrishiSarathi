 PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT Code : 1422 Title of the ITK : Control of gall fly (Pachydiplosis oryzae) in rice Description of the ITK : Gallfly (Pachydiplosis oryzae) is very harmful to rice crop. It damages whole crop of rice. Farmers of Tamar block of Ranchi district in Jharkhand use parso/persu (Ceistanthus collinus) leaves for controlling gallfly. In this practice, fresh leaves of parsu/persu are collected and spread in the infested field without processing. About 10 kg leaves are required for 1,000 m² area. These leaves are spread at the initial stage of infestation. These controlled 70_80% insects. All farmers of the village use this age-old practice. Paddy gallfly is a major insect pest in various parts of Jharkhand. In gall midge endemic areas, it is a regular pest attacking the rice crop year after year. In severe attack the loss in yield may go up 50%. Name and address of the discloser : Shri R.S. Prasad, Department of Extension Education, Birsa Agricultural University, Kanke, Ranchi (Jharkhand) 834 006 Location of use of the ITK : Village Deori, Block Tamar, Ranchi (Jharkhand) Geographical indicators : Parso/persu (Cleistanthus collinus) is a small deciduous tree distributed from the Deccan peninsula, northwards up to the Ganges. It thrives well on dry rocky ground. Experimenters : Shri K. K. Sinha, Assistant Professor cum Junior Scientist, Department of Entomology and Dr R. P. Singh `Ratan', Head, Department of Extension Education, Birsa Agricultural University, Kanke, Ranchi (Jharkhand) 834 006 METHODOLOGY Location The study was conducted in village Deori, block Tamar, Ranchi (Jharkhand). PRA and field study Field study was done by using PRA tools to determine the efficacy of parso leaf as compared to the application of chemical pesticides in controlling gallfly. The parameters included efficacy, persistence of effect, eco-friendliness, efficacy in controlling other pests, cost effectiveness and availability of materials. The study was conducted covering randomly selected 20 practitioners. Experiment Field experiment was conducted in rainy (kharif) season of 2002_03 in randomized block design with three treatments, viz. T1: control; T2: Parso leaf @ 25 kg/ha and T3: application of carbofuran 3 G @ 15 kg/ha (two doses), having 10 replications. Each treatment covered an area of 2,000 m2. Observations on number of tillers/m2, number of affected tillers/m2, percentage of infestation, and extent of control were taken.  PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT  Table 1.
