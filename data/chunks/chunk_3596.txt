 Stigmas are large, orange- yellow in colour. This variety takes 23.67 days for 50% average, the genotype recorded 44.84 t/ha corm yield which is 26.10 % higher over the national check Gajendra and 18.91 % superior to the local check Chikhli Local. Quality traits This variety reported to have appreciable amount of starch (17.89%), dietary fiber (1.34 mg/100g), energy (133 Kcal), protein (1.80%), Vitamin A (20 IU), Fe (8.40 ppm), Mn (11.00 ppm), Zn (41.00 ppm) and Ca (0.32%) in its fresh weight basis. No acridity has been found (10.53 mg / 100 g Ca-oxalate) while consumption after cooking. It becomes completely soft after boiling 20 minutes. In sensory qualities of cooked elephant foot yam cubes it scores 7.75 (liked very much) on the basis of 9-point hedonic scale. Disease resistance Phytophthora blight intensity was recorded in 0-5 standard scale and very little incidence was found. The collar rot severity was recorded in 1-5 standard scale and this variety was found field resistance in Gujarat condition. SUMMARY Swagata is a new high-yielding variety of elephant foot yam developed through clonal selection at Hill Millet Research Station, Navsari Agricultural University, Waghai, The Dangs, Gujarat. After the recommendation of 51st State Seed Sub-Committee, Gandhinagar, Gujarat sprouting. Number of leaflets per plant at 150 days after planting is 210.93 Corm yield This variety falls under the medium maturity group for fresh consumption at different locations in Gujarat (170-180 days after planting). Average corm weight is 1706.12 g. Swagata (NEFY-7) has been evaluated for four years from 2016-17 to 2019-20 in multilocation trials. On Comparison of corm shape, size and flesh colour (Left: Swagata; Right: Gajendra) January–February 2024 13 Production technology Land preparation Two to three ploughing followed by planking then digging of pits (20 cm deep, 20 cm length and 20 cm width) for planting of corms Propagation Seed corm of 200-250 g weight Seed treatment Dithane M-45 or Redomil or Carbendazim @ 2.0 g per litre of water for 1 kg corm or Trichoderma @ 5.0 g in 1.0 kg of fresh cow dung slurry for 1.0 kg of seed corm Planting Time 15 May to 15 June (onset of monsoon) during kharif for rainfed crop and 15 February to 15 April during summer for irrigated crop Seed corm rate (kg/ha) Spacing (cm) No. of seed corm / pit 30 to 35 q/ha depending on spacing, having 200-250 g corm weight 60 × 60 cm One whole corm/one piece corm Gap filling Gap filling is required after germination of corms.
