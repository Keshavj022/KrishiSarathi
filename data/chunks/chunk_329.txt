However, Kullu and Una district have negligible area and production of millets in Amaranthus Proso millet Finger millet Buckwheat Cultivation of various millets Himachal Pradesh (Table 1). In Himachal Pradesh, area under millets has been decreasing drastically over the years, because of surrender of major area under cash crop like apple and pear in Shimla and Kinnaur district while mango and citrus in Kangra district and millets cultivation and consumption is now confined to domestic level. SUMMARY Millets being oldest food known to humanity have started to regain their significance owing to their nutritional quality, low carbon footprint and wider climatic adaptability under changing climatic scenario. Therefore, exploitation of indigenous or improved varieties/ hybrids in potential niche areas for their introduction and large-scale adoption may play a significant role in the productivity improvement of these crops.
