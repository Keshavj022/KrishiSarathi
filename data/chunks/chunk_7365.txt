These markers were validated in an independent F2 population (JI-35Ã—48- 1) and found that these markers clearly differentiate plant population into resistant and susceptible category. Thus, these markers can be further used in MAS for development of wilt resistant castor varieties. Development of genome edited lines for IPA1 gene in Swarna rice: The miR156 binding site of the Ideal Plant Architecture gene 1 (IPA1) was edited through CRISPR/Cas9 technique in rice variety Swarna. The edited lines showed ~40% increase in number of spikelets per panicle. First lipoxygenase-2 free soybean variety NRC 132: Lipoxygenase-2 is the principal contributor to off-flavor associated with the soy products, and is one of the major deterrents in widespread consumption Swarna Swarna IPA1-T0-11-3 Swarna Swarna IPA1-T0-11-3 CROP IMPROVEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 47 of soybean in food use despite being a rich source of proteins. Using marker-assisted selection strategy, lipoxygenase-2 free soybean variety NRC 132 was developed, and identified for cultivation in Southern and Eastern zones. Soy products manufactured using this variety have reduced off-flavor. The plants of this variety flower in 40 days, and become ready for harvesting in 98 and 104 days in Southern and Eastern zone, respectively. Identification and characterization of drought- responsive genes in wild chickpea: Cicer microphyllum is a wild relative of C. arietinum, which is naturally adapted to cold desert conditions of Ladakh, Lahaul and Spiti in India. Therefore, C. microphyllum may serve as a source of genes and other regulatory elements, responsible for stress tolerance. In order to identify the genes associated with drought tolerance, RNA- seq analysis of C. microphyllum was performed using high-throughput Illumina sequencing system. The de novo assembly of transcriptome data yielded >72000 transcripts, which were annotated using GO, EC and KEGG.
