 Promotion of Farmers clubs/ FPOs/FPCs for value chains and market linkages needs to be addressed. There is considerable scope for boosting post harvest processing by setting up of food parks on PPP basis or private investment in the state. State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 30 SUCCESS STORIES 1. Reviving cultivation of rice fallow pulses with the introduction of disease tolerant varieties A significant decline in rice fallow pulse area was witnessed in Andhra Pradesh due to severe incidence of Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV) disease in short duration pulse crops (blackgram and greengram). In 2012-13 area under blackgram stood at 3.7 lakh ha during rabi. The area came down by about 1.2 lakh ha due to reluctance of farmers to cultivate pulses because of YMV disease. Under National Food Security Mission (NFSM), KVKs in Andhra Pradesh demonstrated YMV tolerant blackgram and greengram varieties in rice fallows during rabi 2015-16 and 2016-17. The area under rice fallow blackgram in 2016-17 increased to 4.4 lakh ha. Demonstration of YMV tolerant cultivars such as TBG-104, PU-31,MASH-338 and LBG- 752 in participatory cluster frontline demonstrations indicated a bridgeable yield gap of 2-10 q/ ha and additional net returns of Rs. 17,000 - 58,000/ha.

Intercropping in Sugarcane enhances profitability in Vizianagaram district of North Coastal Zone Sugarcane is cultivated as a rainfed crop in North coastal zone especially in Vizianagaram district in an area of 1.3 lakh ha. However, the productivity of sugarcane is very low at 58.9 t/ha against the state average of 76.2 t/ha. The reasons for low productivity are several which include its cultivation under rainfed conditions in poor soils by resource poor farmers in marginal and sub-marginal land holdings. Non adaption of improved sugarcane production technologies, poor ratoon cane management, water logging and lodging of cane during north east monsoon season, moisture stress during formative phase (March to June) and incidence of major pests like borers and diseases like red rot.
