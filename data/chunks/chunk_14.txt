 Initially, the sole mandate of KVK was to impart training to farmers/farm women/rural youth and extension personnel to enhance their knowledge and skill in the frontier areas of agriculture. During the course of implementation of the KVK scheme, it was realized that training only would not be useful unless it is followed up with frontline demonstrations in farmers’ fields in order to demonstrate the production potential of agricultural technologies. Accordingly, frontline demonstration on important crops of the district was added to the mandate of the KVK. Later on, during VIII Five-Year Plan, the mandate of KVK was further reviewed and On-Farm Testing for identifying technologies in terms of location specific land use systems was added to the mandate of the KVK. Further during XI Plan, the mandate of working as resource and knowledge centre of agricultural technologies for supporting initiatives of public, private and voluntary sectors for improving the agricultural economy of the district was also included as activity of the KVK. The mandate of KVKs was technology assessment, refinement and demonstration of technologies/ products in XII Plan and technology assessment and demonstration for its application and capacity development in XIII plan. Now, the proposed mandate of KVK is Single Window Agricultural Knowledge, Resource and Capacity Development Centre. Significant achievements The KVKs have played a crucial role in empowering the farmers and proved their worth in addressing the needs of the stakeholders by showcasing the frontier technologies, capacity development of stakeholders, front runner in technology application, making available technological information and inputs, practicing participatory approaches in planning, implementing, executing and evaluation, pursuing assessment and refinement of technologies to suit different agro-climatic conditions. Over the past five years, numerous farmers affiliated with KVKs have been honoured by the Government of India with Padma Shri Awards and Genome Saviour Award among others, acknowledging their exceptional contributions to agriculture. This recognition underscores the pivotal role played by KVKs in motivating agricultural talent and fostering innovation within farming communities. The Indian agricultural landscape has witnessed significant transformations through various initiatives taken by KVK aimed at enhancing productivity, ensuring sustainability, and improving farmers’ livelihoods. Among these initiatives, the Cluster Frontline Demonstration (CFLD) program has played a crucial role in bolstering pulses production, elevating it from an average of 17.70 MT to 27.80 MT in 2022-23. Concurrently, efforts focused on doubling farmers’ income through farm-based interventions have yielded promising results, with 75,000 cases documented and analysed.
