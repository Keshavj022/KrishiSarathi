 10 Mrigal Cirrhinus mrigala (Hamilton, 1822)  Mrigal is considered as one of the three Indian major carps and forms an important component of carp polyculture system.  It does not breed in confined water. In nature, it breeds in fluviatile riverine conditions during monsoon.  For captive breeding, the brooders are grown along with other Indian major carps in ponds at biomass of 1,500-2,000 kg/ha. It attains maturity in the second year.  Successful induced breeding is undertaken during May-August, coinciding with monsoon, when the fishes become fully matured. Sexes are separate and distinguishable at maturity with females having bulged abdomen, soft and smooth pectoral fins; whereas males are slender, having stout and rough pectoral fins and milt oozes on pressing the belly.  Brooders are selected and paired in sex ratio of 1:2 female to male in hapa and 1:1 in hatchery systems. They are induced bred with either pituitary extract (PE) or commercial hormone (CH) such as Ovaprim/Ovatide/Gonopro FH.  While single injection of CH @ 0.3-0.4 ml and 0.15-0.20 ml/kg body weight to female and male, respectively, are quite effective, the PE requires two doses @ 2-3 and 6-8 mg/kg and @ 2-3 mg/kg body weight at 6 h interval for female, and @ 2-3 mg/kg for male at the time of second injection to female.  Spawning occurs after 6-8 h, and hatching takes another 14-16 h. Fertilization is generally 75- 90%. Hatchlings take another 55-60 h to attain spawn size with 80-90% survival.  Spawn is reared @ 500-1,000/m2 in well-prepared earthen ponds for 15-20 days to get fry of 20-25 mm size with 30-50% survival or @ 1,000-2,000/m2 in cement tanks achieving survival levels of 60-70%.  The breeding and seed production technology is widely practiced in all the states.

The species is widely distributed in Indian sub-continent, which grows to about 500 g in weight.  Breeds in rivers during May to August. Captive breeding is undertaken by induced breeding in hapa/hatchery.  Brooders are raised in earthen ponds along with other carp species, where they mature in a year. Sexes are separate and well distinguished. Males are identified by oozing milt and females by the bulging belly and reddish vent.  Owing to its small size, the induced breeding of the fish is often undertaken in hapa, where 1-4 pairs of female and males (1:2 ratio) are kept for spawning. However, mass-scale breeding is taken up in hatchery, where males and females are kept at 1:1 ratio.
