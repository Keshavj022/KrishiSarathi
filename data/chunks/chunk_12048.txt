Delivery system:   Seed coating for all carrier based & liquid Biofertilizer   Placement in furrows: VAM   Machine spray: Liquid PUSA-compost   Broadcast in rice fields: BGA 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): All 4. Validation and commercialization: All technologies mentioned have been successfully validated in IARI and farmers’ fields, and also under AICRP trials under different agroecological regions.They have been commercialized and licensed to private companies through IARI-ZTM Unit. 5. Benefits: PUSA-Biofertilizers have covered > than 10,000 ha of cultivated land for nutrient management. The Benefits of the PUSA Biofertilizer technologies has been very good both in terms of savings of chemical nitrogen, P, K as well as increase in crop yields besides improving soil health in a sustainable manner. Of all the field trials conducted over last ten years, it has been found to contribute 20-30 kg N/ha/season with increase in productivity of different crops by 8-25%. Similarly the P uptake has improved and saving of 20- 25 kg P2O5/ha has been recorded. The K augmentation have been observed to be 10-15 kg/ha and Zn about 5-7kg/ha. PUSA biofertilizer technology improves soil health by releasing growth promoting substances and maintains a continuous supply of nutrients to the crop. BGA biofertilizer technology led to enhanced yield and higher income for farmers. PUSA-Compost technology has become popular with the RWA coming forward to use it at individual and community levels. 6.
