 Inland fisheries, especially in rainfed areas, provide substantial opportunities through several farming systems where fish farming is combined with livestock and crop production. Livestock and or fisheries-based farming systems enhance resilience in rural rainfed areas by: Diversification of income sources: Livestock and fisheries-based farming system provides multiple income streams for rural households in rainfed areas, where crop production is often unreliable. Livestock, such as cattle, goats, and poultry, contribute income through the sale of milk, meat, eggs, and manure, while fish farming generates revenue from fish sales. This diversified income base helps reduce the risks associated with crop failure and market fluctuations. Indian Farming 61 January 2025 Efficient resource use: In rainfed regions, where water and nutrient availability is limited, livestock and fisheries-based farming system maximizes resource efficiency. Livestock manure can be used to fertilize fish ponds, enhancing plankton growth, while nutrient-rich water from fish ponds can be used to irrigate crops, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. Enhanced water management: In rainfed regions, water scarcity is a critical challenge. Inclusion of fisheries with livestock enables efficient use of available water resources. Rainwater harvesting structures, ponds, and reservoirs can be used for both fish farming and providing water for livestock and crops, ensuring that water is used sustainably and efficiently. Resilience to climate variability: In rainfed regions, where droughts and floods are common, livestock and fisheries enhances the resilience of farming systems. Livestock can survive on minimal feed during dry periods, and fish ponds can retain water, ensuring continuous production even when crops fail. During floods, fish farming systems can remain functional, while livestock can be relocated to higher ground. Enhanced nutritional security: Livestock and fisheries provide essential sources of nutrition in rural diets, contributing milk, meat, eggs, and fish. Fish, in particular, is a rich source of protein and essential nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids. This combination helps improve dietary diversity, particularly in regions where food security is compromised by unpredictable crop yields. Livestock and fisheries-based farming systems There are several livestock and fisheries-based farming systems across the country and some of the successful models are mentioned below. Dairy-fish farming system: In rainfed areas of Madhya Pradesh, dairy farming has been successfully integrated with fish farming in small farm ponds. Farmers keep cows or buffalo for milk production, and fish are stocked in water bodies that also serve as sources of irrigation. National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) observed increased farm income by 50% with dairy-fish farming, with profits coming from both milk sales and fish harvests.
