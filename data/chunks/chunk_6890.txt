During the year, ICAR-CIWA carried out research activities focusing on farm women nutritional security, livelihood enhancement, technological empowerment, drudgery reduction and entrepreneurship development. The salient achievements are as follows: Participation and contribution of women in agriculture: Participation and contribution of women in agriculture and allied sectors were analysed using data from Census 2011, NSS 68th Round Survey and Time Use Study (TUS) 2019. The study makes a distinction between ‘participation’ and ‘contribution’ in agriculture. While participation denotes being involved or not, contribution quantifies the degree of participation using time devoted to an activity. Participation and contribution in agriculture both were calculated from the TUS-2019 data whereas, others give only participation. Based on analysis of unit level data of TUS-2019, it was revealed that in rural areas the participation (in per cent) of women (6yr + age) in agriculture (overall), crop sector only and livestock sector only were 22.36, 13.33 and 10.69, respectively whereas, the contribution were calculated to be 30.8, 27.2 and 45.8%, respectively. The participation and contribution in agriculture by women were calculated for all the states and UTs of India.
