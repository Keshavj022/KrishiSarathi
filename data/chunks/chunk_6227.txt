METHODOLOGY Experiment MASFSU The study was conducted on goats presented to Veterinary College Hospital, Nagpur with the history of diarrhoea or dysentery. These goats were subjected to detailed clinical and parasitological examination and were sub-divided into parasitic and non-parasitic groups and were randomly assigned to two treatments within each broad groups (parasitic and non-parasitic) comprising 6 goats irrespective of their age and sex. Another group consisting of 6 goats was kept as the standard treatment. Fresh flowers of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis were collected in the morning and minced in a mixer to make a homogeneous juice. The juice was strained through a sieve and was drenched @ 15 ml twice a day to goats suffering from parasitic Contents VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY and non-parasitic diarrhoea. Faecal sample examination: Faecal sample of goats suffering with diarrhoea were collected per- rectal in clean sterile glass vials before treatment and thereafter on day 6 of the treatment. The samples were examined by sedimentation technique immediately after collection. Therapeutic efficacy: The therapeutic efficacy of the drugs was evaluated on the basis of eggs per gram faeces (EPG) determined by modified Stall's dilution technique on day 0 and 6 after- treatment.
