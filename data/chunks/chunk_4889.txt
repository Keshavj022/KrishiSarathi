 Crop suitability mapping is emerging as an advanced method to assist farmers, researchers, and policymakers in making data-driven decisions for sustainable fruit crop cultivation. India is one of the largest producers of litchi, with key production areas located in the states of Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Assam. However, the expansion of litchi cultivation is constrained by regional variations in climate and soil quality. In a study using Geomatic tools and AHP technique, approximately 47% of Indiaâ€™s total geographic area (TGA) was found unsuitable for litchi cultivation, while 3.7 and 9.98% were classified as very suitable and suitable, respectively. States like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh were identified as leading regions for litchi cultivation within the very suitable category. Some smaller suitable areas were found in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. However, most of southern and central India was deemed unsuitable for litchi. This study also highlighted the potential impact of climate change, suggesting that traditional litchi-growing regions in eastern India (Bihar, West Bengal, and eastern Uttar Pradesh) may become less suitable in the future. A northward and upward (altitude) shift in litchi suitability zones was observed. The methods used to develop the litchi crop potential zonation (LCPZ) map can be applied to other crops and regions globally. These findings are crucial for policymakers, planners, and growers, though future modifications to the map will be necessary to accommodate the development of new litchi cultivars and the effects of climate change, along with access to more precise climate and soil data. Future prospects While AI-powered crop suitability mapping has tremendous potential, it faces several challenges. A major hurdle is the availability and quality of data, especially in regions with limited technological infrastructure. AI models depend heavily on accurate, timely data to produce reliable predictions, but in many developing areas, access to such data remains difficult. Furthermore, the complexity of environmental variables like climate change, soil degradation, and water availability makes it challenging to create models that are universally applicable across diverse regions. However, with ongoing advancements in AI, remote sensing, and IoT technologies, these tools could become increasingly effective for suitability mapping and predictive modeling. Such tools can also help develop more robust adaptation strategies for climate change. Digital maps created through GIS, remote sensing, and AHP techniques can be enhanced by incorporating AI for predictive modeling, enabling the development of suitability maps that account for future climate scenarios.
