 The major forest types include dry deciduous (42%), moist deciduous (20%), and semi-evergreen (14%) forests, primarily located in tropical regions. Around 62% of Indian forests are classified as semi-natural, 23% as natural and untouched, and the remaining 15% as planted forests. States with the largest forest areas include Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha. Notably, 58% of Indian forests are fully protected by the government, with minimal human activity. Additionally, 29% of the forest area is designated for biodiversity conservation, 16% for water and soil protection, and 25% for bioenergy and wood fiber production. The remaining 30% is allocated for multiple uses. The northeastern region of India, despite accounting for only 8% of the country’s geographical area, contains 25% of its forest cover, showcasing remarkable forest diversity. Mizoram leads with 84.53% forest cover relative to its geographical area, followed by Arunachal Pradesh (79.33%), Meghalaya (76%), Manipur (74.34%), and Nagaland (73.90%). These states feature biodiversity and high species density, forming part of the world’s biodiversity hotspots. The versatility of the pyrolysis process and its capability to handle a variety of feedstocks enable customized solutions adapted to specific agricultural areas [69]. Figure 4 illustrates the conceptual structure of biomass into products. Figure 4. Conceptual structure of biomass into products. 6. Waste management Pyrolysis is a sustainable approach to waste management by converting agricultural waste and biological waste into valuable energy products. In the context of waste processing, pyrolysis involves the controlled thermal decomposition of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment [70]. Figure 5 illustrates a schematic setup of pyrolysis product distribution. Presently, India is dealing with the hurdles of rapid metropolization and the accompanying rise in waste generation. In response, pyrolysis has become a popular solution for both waste management and harnessing the energy potential of organic waste streams. This technology promotes renewable and circular solutions to resource utilization [71]. Figure 5. Pyrolysis product distribution. 7. Technological development Continuous research and technological innovations are driving ongoing progress in pyrolysis. These improvements boost efficiency, increase hydrogen production, and fine-tune process parameters. Two notable areas of advancement in pyrolysis technology include fast pyrolysis and microwave-assisted pyrolysis. 7.1 Fast pyrolysis Fast pyrolysis is a technological advancement that involves the rapid application of heat to biomass at high temperatures (400-800oC) having minimal residence periods [72]. This swift procedure allows biomass to degrade quickly, yielding bio-oil, charcoal, and gaseous byproducts. Fast pyrolysis stands out for its ability to dramatically boost bio-oil production.
