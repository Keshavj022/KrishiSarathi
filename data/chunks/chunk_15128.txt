 • Insurance and Yield Loss Mitigation: Promoting drought insurance and implementing strategies to reduce annual yield loss due to water scarcity are crucial for safeguarding farmers’ interests. • Crop Diversification and Water-Saving Practices: Encouraging the adoption of water-saving crops and modern irrigation techniques can mitigate water scarcity challenges. • Water Use Efficiency and Infrastructure Improvement: Addressing water loss during transportation and encouraging infrastructure improvements like pipelines can enhance water use efficiency. • Land Levelling and Storage Infrastructure: Promoting periodic land leveling and subsidizing farm pond construction can significantly impact water storage and distribution. • Promotion of Drip Irrigation: Encouraging affordable drip irrigation through financial support and technological advancements can optimize water use. • Model Farmer Replication: Promoting successful farming practices through model farmers can guide others to enhance their yield and overall efficiency. • Water Management Knowledge: Disseminating knowledge on effi­ cient irrigation and water quality management is vital for sustainable water resource utilization. • Formal Education and Awareness: Fostering formal education and creating awareness about water management practices are funda­ mental in achieving a scientific approach to irrigation and agriculture. It can be stated that these sub-indicators provide a roadmap for strategic interventions and policy recommendations to enhance agri­ cultural water management and uplift the livelihoods of farmers in the study area. Conclusion The study’s findings hold substantial practical implications directly tied to our main objectives. The study aimed to understand AWPI vari­ ations along Jayakwadi Dam channels, identify strengths and weak­ nesses, and propose improvements. The weakest components, resources, and capacity call for targeted resource management and enhanced infrastructure, addressing identified weaknesses and aligning with our objectives. Strategic resource allocation, diversifying water sources, and enhancing infrastructure will mitigate overreliance, improving water use efficiency. The positive correlation between high AWPI component scores re­ inforces our objective of understanding spatial correlations. Policy measures enhancing access and capacity align with this aspect, under­ scoring our objective to suggest possible improvements. Future research should explore technological impacts and socio-economic influences, aligning with our objective to contribute to knowledge. Moreover, the study emphasizes a comprehensive approach, incor­ porating technology, education, and policy reforms. This aligns with our objective to suggest improvements, emphasizing a multifaceted strategy for sustainable water management and enhanced agricultural produc­ tivity.
