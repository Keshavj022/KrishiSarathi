 Observations recorded: 1, field capacity of the implements; 2, drudgery or draft; 3, weeding efficiency; 4, total energy expenditure; 5, cost of each operation for various implements; 6, cost of production; 7, gross income; 8, net income; 9, cost:benefit ratio; and 10, farmers' reaction (performance of the treatments). Refinement of the ITK: Difficulty in fabrication of exact shape of pingali dhanti was observed while fabricating the implement. Another difficulty was the availability of a suitable size of steel flat for shanks. Hence in 2004, the shape of the shank was modified without sacrificing the effective width of the blade. The local artisans found it easy to fabricate the modified model. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Data presented in Table 1 showed the rainfall- distribution pattern during the rainfed tomato crop-growing season in 2002, 2003 and 2004. It was observed that all the three years experienced deficit rainfall when compared with the mean rainfall over 34 years (1970- 2004). Among the years under study, 2003 received better rainfall than the other 2 years. The crop in different farmers' fields experienced short-duration dry spell during vegetative and flowering stages in 2002 and long-duration dry spell during vegetative stage of the crop in 2004. The results on the farmers' fields in 2002-03 (Table 2) indicated that a combination of hand- weeding either with pingali dhanti or blade harrow enhanced the tomato yield by 15 and 20% and net income by 83 and 50% and compared with the interculture implements alone.

The results obtained in 2003-04 revealed that the use of pingali dhanti for interculture operation significantly increased the productivity and net income (Rs 1245/ha) compared with the interculture with blade harrow (Rs 1697/ha). Interculture with pingali dhanti along with hand- weeding gave 11 % increase in yield and 84% increase in net income over the blade harrow with one hand-weeding (22.49 q/ha). Operation of pingali dhanti along with one hand-weeding showed higher weeding efficiency at different days after transplanting over interculture with pingali dhanti alone. There was no significant variation between the two interculture implements in respect of field capacity, draft and energy requirement.
