 Silage and hay Ryegrass has a strong production capability of silage which makes it a popular choice for extra feed when hay supplies are predicted to be scarce. To produce high-quality fodder, ryegrass is intercropped with legumes to boost the protein content. Timely cutting of annual ryegrass is done to boost the quality- quantity of fodder. Silage quality is highly determined by the maturity stage upon harvest. Ensiled annual ryegrass has increased cow feeding in small-scale dairy production systems. SUMMARY Ryegrass produces highly digestible and palatable fodder. The forage of ryegrass can support high dry matter intake levels and is suitable for animals with high nutritional requirements. It is relatively easy to establish and is versatile in nature to be used as green fodder, silage, and in haymaking. It is an outstanding forage crop with various production systems like intercropping with different fodder crops. The nutrient combination of 75% RDF + 25% N with FYM + PGPR is cost-effective and produces high-quality fodder for ryegrass production in northern India. Thus, this combined nutrient application may be recommended as an economically profitable option for resource-poor farmers to harvest higher fodder production. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: magansingh07@gmail.com Table 2.

It is a major industry in livestock sector offering promising employment opportunitites throughout India for veterinary and animal science graduates. The book has been designed and written in a lucid manner to prepare an exhaustive information source for undergraduate students with special reference to Indian farming and business conditions. The book consists of 16 chapters on different aspects of the poultry production. Each chapter has practice exercise at the end for better understanding of concepts. We hope that this book will be able to serve its purpose.
