They may choose to reduce cooking time, make dishes that are easy, less time consuming and require less effort. This in turn can affect nutrients derived from these meals For analyzing, we categorize time spent in meal preparation in two- time slots, based on their meal preparation behavior (table 7). We look at the relationship between time spent in agriculture on cooking time in the morning and evening separately, and we find that for every ten additional minutes spent in agricultural work, cooking time is reduced by 4 min during the evening meal, and this result is robust to all specifications. As shown in table 8, we further explore the direct link of agricultural time on the consumption of nutrients in the evening; we find that an increase in agricultural time reduces all nutrient intakes during the evening meal consumption. These results point to a reduction in cooking time due to increased time demands from agriculture during the evening meal preparation, with a subsequent decline in nutrient intake. 5. Conclusion and discussion Using novel primary panel data and methods, we examine the rela­ tionship between women’s opportunity cost of time and their nutrient intake. We hypothesize the following: as seasons change, the pressures on women’s time in agriculture change. During peak seasons relative to lean seasons, they experience time constraints that influence their household activities. These different time pressures induce a trade-off for women’s time for nutrition-enhancing activities, such as cooking and domestic activities, which may have adverse consequences for nutrition.
