883623 ha) TUMKUR TALUK TUMKUR DISTRICT Indian Horticulture 40 applied in various domains, such as drought and salinity tolerance, nutrient deficiency, disease detection, pest resistance, and yield optimization (Table 2). They enable breeders to assess traits such as surface temperature, transpiration rates, shoot biomass, and more specifically, tailored to specific breeding goals. By providing valuable insights into plant characteristics, phenotyping accelerates the development of superior crop varieties and enhances their resilience and productivity. Thermal imaging detects infrared radiation to measure canopy temperature, indicating water stress, because plants with reduced transpiration show higher temperatures. It offers high accuracy for real-time stress assessments and can be mounted on drones or ground systems. However, weather conditions may also affect the reliability. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging monitors leaf and soil water content, whereas far-infrared (FIR) imaging measures temperature. Both techniques are valuable for studying drought stress and the traits related to osmotic resistance. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging provides information on photosynthetic efficiency, allowing for the detection of stresses that affect photosynthesis, such as light, heat, or nutrient stress. This technique is non-invasive and highly sensitive to early stage stress responses. Image-based technologies provide a non- destructive, accurate, and scalable means for assessing abiotic stress in horticultural crops. By capturing detailed visual and spectral information, these tools help farmers and researchers understand plant health at both macro and micro levels, facilitating early intervention and improving stress management strategies. Digital technologies for mitigating abiotic stress Digital technologies for mitigating abiotic stress in horticultural crops include various tools and methods aimed at optimizing resource use and supporting adaptive crop management. These innovations reduce the impacts of stress factors, such as drought, salinity, and extreme temperatures, thereby enhancing crop resilience and productivity. The key digital technologies employed for this purpose include automated precision irrigation systems, environmental control systems, image-based technologies, weather-monitoring tools, and drones. Water and nutrients are vital inputs for horticultural crop plants to maintain growth and productivity. Water deficits during critical developmental stages can lead to significant yield losses, making precision-sensor-based irrigation essential. Advanced irrigation systems equipped with IoT sensors and remote sensing data adjust water application rates based on real-time crop needs and environmental conditions. For example, soil moisture sensors can continuously monitor moisture levels and automatically regulate irrigation systems, thereby reducing water and nutrient waste.
