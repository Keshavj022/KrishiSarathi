 Strategically located for harnessing export potential of vegetables, fruits and flowers to SE Asian countries. x. Organic farming can be taken up for select vegetables, spices, medicinal plants, aromatic rice, etc. 240 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 xi. Jharkhand is the leading producer of lac and tasar; there is ample scope strengthening these sectors along with apiculture through integration with general agriculture for enhancing the income of the growers and local enterprises for value addition. xii. The tribal farmers have retained useful traditional crops and practices, which can be mainstreamed for food security and appropriate technologies, acceptable to them. Challenges i. By and large, mono-cropping system prevails in the state hence the cropping intensity is very low, i.e., 116%. ii. Predominantly rain-fed agriculture, 75% of the net sown area is rainfed in the state. iii. Water productivity is very low (0.26 kg/m3) in Jharkhand. Similarly, out of 5.25 BCM available ground water, the state hardly utilizes 1.09 BCM (~20%), indicating the scope of improvement in both. iv. The per capita availability of food grains is currently at 250 g/day, which needs to enhanced up to 400-500 g/day; similarly per capita availability of fish, meat, milk and egg is very low compared national averages. v. The farmers of Jharkhand, especially the tribals, lead a conservative life style and do not readily accept and adopt new technologies. vi. Area under forest is recorded to be about 29%. Tribal communities that constitute 26.30% of the population, solely depend on forests spread over 2.33 m ha for firewood, fodder, food and timber. Deforestation, over-grazing by livestock and loss of wetland due to siltation and exploitation of forest are putting tremendous pressure on plant biodiversity in the state. vii. Heavy mining activities lead to emergence of degraded lands, which need to restored through planting appropriate MPTs. 12.2 Strategy and interventions for doubling of farmers’ income 1. Central and North Eastern Plateau Sub Zone IV (Medium Land (Don- II) and Lowland (Don-I) – 14 districts (Area=14.5 lakh ha). Rice is a major crop that occupies about 70% area in kharif, rest 30 % is covered under maize, pigeon-pea, Horse gram (kulthi), vegetables, etc. Main constraints in the region are: (i) Low availability of hybrid/HYV/quality seed, (ii) Acidic Soils and (iii) imbalanced use of fertiliser for hybrids   Increasing availability of hybrid seed on larger scale production of location specific hybrids from the current production of 3750 tons to 6750 ton for increasing area under 2lakh ha to 4 lakh ha   Judicious use of nutrients (NPK) in hybrid rice (150:70:90 to 100:50:60) for reducing cost of cultivation 241 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022   Jharkhand soils are highly acidic that limit the productivity due to inefficient uptake ofthe nutrients.
