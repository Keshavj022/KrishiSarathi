 Prophylactic spray with azadirachtin followed by systemic insecticides spray is recommended for the management of the insect pest. Propagation Dendrobiums can be easily propagated by division of pseudobulbs and through keikis. Keikis are generally produced along the old canes. Dendrobium orchids are famous for producing keikis. Keiki (pronounced Kay-key) is the Hawaiian word for “babies”. At first, keikis will develop leaves followed by roots. When roots (at least two) are about 1-2 inch in length, the keikis can be removed from the mother plant and planted in another container. Keikis will be identical to the plant they were removed from and are also entitled to be recognized by the same variety name. From healthy, leafless, older canes, 10 to12 cm long cuttings with ≥ three nodes per cuttings, can be used for sowing in moist sphagnum moss for rooting. Commercially, Dendrobium orchids are propagated by tissue culture. Either seed or apical or lateral buds are used for tissue culture; which proliferates as protocorm like bodies. Dendrobium hybrid flower July–August 2023 35 sucrose @ 2% + 8-HQC @ 100 ppm + BA @ 25 ppm) can remarkably increase the vase life of Dendrobium cut flowers.Vase solutions for increasing vase life of Dendrobium cut flowers may be any of the following AOA @ 0.5 mM + sucrose @ 4%, 8-HQC @ 200 ppm + sucrose @ 2%, AgNO3 @ 30 ppm + sucrose @ 4%, 8-HQS @ 200 ppm + AgNO3 @ 50 ppm + sucrose @ 8%, HQ @ 400 ppm + AgNO3 @ 30 ppm + sucrose @ 2%, 400 ppm Carbendazim. Grading: The orchid flowers are graded as per the standards before marketing. Spikes are graded by colour, length, flower size, etc. There are four standard size grades based on spike length and stalk quality. Grade Spike length (cm) Number of opened flowers Extra-large (XL) 50 >10 Large (L) 45 8-10 Medium (M) 40 6-8 Small (S) 30 4-5 Packaging: Around 5 spikes with same grade are bunched in a pack box. The cut end of each flower stem in the box must be placed in a preservative solution or water containing tube (specialized tube that prevents solution emission from any side). During transportation the water loss from the spikes is supplemented by liquid from the tubes. Wet cotton can also be used to wrap the cut end of the spike. Cotton dipped in preservative solution or water should be wrapped at the cut end of the spikes with the help of a polythene sheet and tied with rubber band or thread. A cushioning material can be kept at back of the tube that can prevent damage during transportation. These graded flowers are packed in cardboard or hard paper boxes of suitable sizes. The base of the spikes can be fixed with the carton with the help of some adhesive tapes so that the movement of the spikes inside the boxes during transit can be restricted. The box length varies according to the length of the spikes. Sufficient number of holes should be there on the box to provide proper aeration to the flowers. Storage: Dendrobium cut flowers can be stored at 7-10⸰C with 80-95% RH.
