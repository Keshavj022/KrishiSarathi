 3,850 per acre) is represented by the size of the boxes, with the confidence intervals depicted by the arms. These findings align with David W. C. et al. (2015), who reported greater profitability of organic agriculture globally across 55 crops in 14 countries.

Organic farming, which relies on natural processes and biodiversity, contrasts with inorganic methods that use synthetic inputs like pesticides and fertilizers. Despite India’s rich history in organic farming, there is limited research comparing the economic outcomes of organic and inorganic practices. To address this gap, a meta-analysis of 27 studies was conducted, sourced from platforms like Google Scholar and Krishi Kosha. Using statistical methods such as Fixed and Random Effect Models and cumulative analyses, the study processed data with STATA, producing Forest and Funnel plots. The findings showed that organic farming incomes varied from Rs. 801.60/acre to Rs. 13,799.20/acre, with four studies reporting losses. Despite variability, the Random Effect Model indicated an overall profit of Rs. 3,850/acre for organic farming compared to inorganic, suggesting that organic farming offers a generally profitable alternative in India.
