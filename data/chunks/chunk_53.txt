BC ratio in wheat under different CRM machines Information, Education and Communication (IEC) for last mile connectivity and awareness District level frontline extension agencies of Haryana and Delhi organised 1218 campaigns during 2018-2023, at village, block and district level with the participation of 99,735 farmers. Besides, 331 training programmes were also conducted in which 13,746 farmers were trained for residue management practices. Rice growing farmers were given five-day trainings in collaboration with the state department of agriculture. The campaigns also included detailed information about schemes and incentives to farmers on crop residue management machinery and custom hiring centres. In Haryana and Delhi, students of 416 schools and 102 colleges were mobilized through essay competitions, paintings, debates, etc. and about 39,580 students were informed about benefits of in situ crop residue management. Total 103 farmers’ fairs were organised in Haryana and Delhi with the participation of 65,511 farmers from nearby villages. Live demonstrations of machineries used for crop residue management after harvesting of rice were made in these farmers’ fairs. SUMMARY Use of in situ crop residue management machines could turn ‘so called’ waste or residue into a much ‘productive’ asset contributing towards 3.23 kg/day in the productivity and 104.3 /day in net return. Beyond the food security and economic indicators, the in-situ residue management also contributes towards soil sustainability and is an environment friendly activity. The frontline extension institutes in target states of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi NCR and Uttar Pradesh proactively undertook these machines to farmers’ fields for their popularization and infuse ‘pull’ effect for creating demand of these machineries. The State Governments should incentivised both individuals and community approach for upscaling machineries.
