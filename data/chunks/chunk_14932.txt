 ML- based approaches simplify the modeling of complex, nonlinear, and computationally demanding processes while offering several advantages over traditional empirical and physics-based models. Recent studies have successfully employed various ML techniques including artificial neural networks (ANN), random forests (RF), decision trees (DT), gradient tree boosting (GTR), and support vector machines (SVM) to model thermochemical conversion processes [94,95]. Machine learning models are increasingly being used to enhance the understanding and optimization of biohydrogen production. One method involves applying data mining and predictive modeling to analyze experimental data and identify key factors influencing production efficiency. By studying these patterns, researchers can develop predictive models to determine the conditions that maximize biohydrogen yield and pinpoint variables that should be adjusted for process optimization. Another approach utilizes reinforcement learning algorithms, which improve biohydrogen production through a trial-and-error learning process. These algorithms continuously refine their strategies to identify the most effective conditions for maximizing production efficiency [96]. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are advanced machine learning models capable of recognizing patterns in data and making accurate predictions as shown in Figure 8 [97]. ANN models have been extensively explored for optimizing biohydrogen production by identifying the most effective parameter combinations to maximize yield [98-100]. These models typically achieve high prediction accuracy, with most displaying R² values above 0.90 and some exceeding 0.99, indicating exceptional reliability. Figure 8. Typical machine learning algorithms of ANN [97]. In addition to ANN, recent studies have evaluated alternative machine-learning models for biohydrogen process modeling. Techniques such as gradient boosting machines, support vector machines, random forests, and AdaBoost have been assessed using metrics like R² and mean squared error (MSE) to determine their predictive accuracy. These models demonstrated strong predictive performance, with R² values of 0.89 (gradient boosting and support vector machines), 0.90 (random forest), and 0.89 (AdaBoost), alongside low MSE values (ranging from 0.015 to 0.016), highlighting their effectiveness in optimizing biohydrogen production. 7.7 Indian government policies and prospects Hydrogen energy has received consistent encouragement and support from the Indian government. The latest developments have revolved around green hydrogen, specifically in the automobile sector [101,102]. The full indirect approach scrutinized the demand for green hydrogen in different sectors of India [103]. The government is addressing the economic challenges of small and mid-sized industrial policy binds, by using platform approaches to help them in the global market.
