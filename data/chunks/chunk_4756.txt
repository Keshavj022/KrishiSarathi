This is 32% higher yield than the popular commercial hybrid, Naga; 38% higher than the hybrid, Mallika. Weekly application of WSF@150:90:150 kg NPK/ha recorded maximum yield of 53.73 t/ha with a maximum B:C ratio of 2.22. Arka Vikram has been tested over 18 locations across the country in various agro- climatic zones during 2017-2020. Mean performance of Arka Vikram in zone 4 over 6 locations was 153.89 q/ha with an increase of 11.1% over the check variety, P u s a N a s d a r / P u s a Nutan which yielded 138.49 q/ha. In Zone 8, Arka Vikram average performance was 291.15q/ha against check varieties (233.67 q/ha) recording 24.6% increase over checks (Table 1). Adoption of Arka Vikram So far, Arka Vikram, a high yielding ridge gourd hybrid cultivation is taken up in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana by 150- 200 farmers covering 800 acres of land.
