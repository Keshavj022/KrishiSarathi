 The Insect Museum of ICAR-NBAIR is recognized by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India as the National Repository for Agriculturally Important Insects, Spiders and Mites under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 on 12 September 2012. It comprises ~2.80 lakh insect specimens. At present, the National Insect Museum has indigenous and exotic collections of around 188,830 dry mounted specimens, 349 primary and secondary type specimens and more than 1 lakh specimens preserved in alcohol, besides vouchers specimens of invasive species, specimens and representative specimens from different geographical regions collected from various agro ecosystems. The live insect repository at NBAIR holds live insects and insect derived resources with a total of ~139 insects comprising 108 parasitoids (species/strains), 17 predators and 14 host insects, besides 690 microbial comprising 203 Bt isolates, 18 insect viruses, 198 entomofungal pathogens, 148 fungal antagonists and 123 entomopathogenic nematodes. To maintain the authenticity of the insects, the DNA barcodes using CO1/ ITS genes of insects were developed for 676 insect species and 2,815 other insect derived resources.
