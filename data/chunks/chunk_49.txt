 Role of soil micro-fauna and _ microbial communities: Soil micro-fauna, dependent on soil organic carbon for metabolism, are crucial for nutrient cycling and ecosystem sustainability. Changes in soil organic carbon content directly impact microbial populations, compositions, and functions. The addition of crop residues has been observed to rapidly enhance microbial activity, improving the soilâ€™s ecological environment. Microbial communities, integral to soil ecosystem processes and biogeochemical cycles, are influenced positively by crop residue returning. The increased organic matter content in the soil provides an optimal environment for the growth and proliferation of microorganisms. In conclusion, the incorporation of rice residues in situ significantly influences soil biological properties, shaping the dynamics of both macro- and micro-fauna, and microbial communities. Understanding these Indian Farming 18 March 2024 Indian Farming 19 March 2024 intricate relationships is essential for implementing agricultural practices that not only enhance crop productivity but also promote the long-term health and sustainability of the soil ecosystem. Proficient machines for in situ management of rice residue Happy seeder: Happy Seeder has revolutionised farm machinery segment designed for efficient wheat sowing. This innovative machine allows farmers to sow wheat seeds directly into the soil in field vacated after rice harvest. This machine effectively cuts and lifts the previous crop residues and simultaneously allow sowing of seeds, promotes no-till farming practices, conserves soil moisture and improves soil health. This sustainable approach not only enhances wheat cultivation but also addresses environmental concerns by reducing air pollution associated with traditional residue burning. Happy Seeder stands as a promising solution for modern and eco-friendly wheat sowing in agriculture. Wheat sowing by Happy seeder Super seeder: Super seeder is an improvement over happy seeder wherein rotavator is added which accomplish all the shallow tilling and all other activities of happy seeder for wheat sowing. This machine also allows farmers to sow wheat seeds directly into the soil effectively cutting and lifting the previous crop residues simultaneously. The Super Seeder, although an improvement over happy seeder but its efficiency and advantages are yet to be established in the field. Farmers are still preferring Happy seeder for its higher yield advantage in wheat. Zero till seed drill: The Zero till seed drill is an innovative agricultural tool that revolutionizes wheat sowing practices. Unlike traditional methods that involve plowing and tilling the soil before seeding, the Zero till seed drill allows farmers to sow wheat directly into untilled soil, minimizing soil disturbance. This conservation tillage approach helps retain soil moisture, prevents erosion, and promotes overall soil health.
