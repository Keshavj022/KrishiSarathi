 Moreover, the erratic climatic changes, the industrial revolution, and various anthropogenic activities worsened the situation (von Braun et al., 2013). Land degradation mainly affects resource-poor farmers due * Corresponding author at: ICAR-IISWC, Dehradun 248 195, India. E-mail address: saswatkumarkar@gmail.com (S.K. Kar).

How­ ever, in the case of developing countries like India, the deterioration of land is a major concern, as it will further deteriorate the declining per capita cultivable land availability. India has only 2.4% of the global land area, which has to feed 18% and 15% of the global human and livestock population, respectively, and also the Indian agriculture contributes around 17% of the national GDP (Bhattacharyya et al., 2015; Sreenivas et al., 2021). A decadal change in the land degradation scenario for India was studied by Sreenivas et al. (2021), which indicates a reduction of degraded land by about 0.1 million hectares during 2015–16 compared to 2005–6, although there was an inter and intra land-use change. Deterioration of soil health adds risk to maintaining ecosystem ser­ vices and food security (Mohamed et al., 2019). Globally, land degra­ dation is a severe issue, and its severity is higher in humid and subhumid areas than in arid, semiarid, and hyper-arid regions (Nkonya et al., 2011) and further spreading to more areas, which needs immediate attention to check further expansion (von Braun et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2020). Due to climate change, further land degradation scenario is ex­ pected to occur soon, which necessitates the adoption of climate- resilient management strategies in terms of investment in land re­ sources to attain land degradation neutrality (Bhattacharyya et al., 2015; Bhattacharyya, 2020; Kar et al., 2023). Deforestation of natural forest cover followed by land use change leads to a decline in soil's physiochemical properties (Bahrami et al., 2010). Further destruction of natural biodiversity leads to runoff, erosion, carbon emission, etc. Degrading soil health due to intensive and continuous conventional cultivation practices influences the availability of quality cultivable land, ultimately threatening long-term sustainable agricultural growth (Patra et al., 2019b; Sreenivas et al., 2021). Hence, the conservation and sustainability of natural resources are important for enhancing yield and maintaining livelihood under the changing climatic scenario (Kar et al., 2016; Singh and Tewari, 2021; Kar et al., 2022). Several bioengineering and ecological measures may be adopted to restore soil health (Gao and Liu, 2010).
