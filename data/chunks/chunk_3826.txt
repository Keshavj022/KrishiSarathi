 wightii; Raise awareness about the ecological importance, cultural value, and potential economic benefits associated with the species; Engaging local communities as conservation partners can lead to more effective and sustainable conservation outcomes. Tissue culture: It is a valuable tool for the conservation of C. wightii. Tissue culture also known as in vitro propagation or micropropagation, is a valuable tool for conserving rare and endangered plant species. It involves the aseptic culture of plant cells, tissues, or organs in a controlled laboratory environment, allowing for the production of genetically identical plants on a large scale. Tissue culture can contribute to the conservation of C. wightii by mass propagation, disease elimination, cryopreservation, clonal propagation, habitat restoration, and research and genetic studies. Also, tissue culture provides a platform for studying the biology, physiology, and genetics of C. wightii. It enables researchers to investigate the factors influencing plant growth, development, and responses to environmental stress. This knowledge can improve conservation strategies and aid in the development of effective management plans for endangered species. Overall, tissue culture plays a significant role in the conservation of C. wightii by providing a means to propagate, preserve, and restore their populations. It offers a valuable tool for maintaining genetic diversity, eliminating diseases, and contributing to the long-term survival of threatened plant species. At ICAR-DMAPR, Anand, Gujarat, a tissue culture method has been developed for the conservation and micropropagation of C. wightii. SUMMARY C. wightii is crucial for its medicinal value, making its conservation essential. Protecting this plant through tissue culture techniques can preserve its unique genetic traits and ensure sustainable availability. By doing so, we secure its role in traditional medicine and protect biodiversity and ecosystems. Introducing conservation measures and employing tissue culture methods is vital to safeguard C. wightii’s future, benefitting both human health and the environment.

Global warming, caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions leads to change in climate resulting in altered seasonal patterns, weather events, and temperature ranges worldwide, which is a significant concern for agriculture. Agriculture contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, with nitrogenous fertilizers and deforestation being major sources of N2O emissions.
