 The percentage of candidates for AIEEA (UG) from rural areas has more or less remained static at least over the last three years warranting shift in strategies to popularise agricultural education amongst the rural youths/students in the country. The present report containing an assessment of the past examination trends and providing insights into future examination trends is the third in the series on Examination Statistics published by the Agricultural Education Division. The earlier publications; All India Entrance Examination for Admission to Bachelor and Master’s degree programmes (AIEEA-UG & PG) in Agriculture & Allied Sciences and SRF(PGS) – At a Glance and Talent for Responsive Agriculture encompassed Examination Statistics for the Academic Session 2007-08 to 2012-13 and 2007-08 to 2013-14, respectively. The present publication containing Examination statistics from 2014-15 through 2019-20 is expected to provide necessary inputs for evidence-based policy making. This publication is also intended to provide pointers to the low performing universities so that they can take required curative measures in order to offer a competition to the universities giving better performance.
