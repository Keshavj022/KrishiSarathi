I spoke to Dr Khadi at length and I could construct the events as: 1. Year 2003-2004 (July 2003 - January 2004): T 3 generation 2. Year 2004-2005 (July 2004 - January 2005): T-4 generation (sampled for Southern). Dharwad station celebrated centenary in November 2004. The research staffwas busy with preparations and celebrations. It seems several visitors visited the BNBt site. Not much data collection took place. 3. Year 2005-2006 (July 2005 - January 2006): T-5 generation (Dr Khadi was in Nagpur and Dr Katageri was in UK; Dr Khadi raised plants in the Glass house; Dr Khadi must have referred to the seed he obtained from T-4 plants. That means the plants he raised in Nagpur would be T-5 generation; It seems Dr Sumanbala did a few crosses during this time) 4. Year 2006-2007: As I understand, large scale crossings were done in 2006 by utilizing the seed from the glass house raised plants as well as seed from UAS- Dharwad (collected under the supervision ofDr S. S. Patillo I do not rule out some errors. I tried my best by keeping myself in the place in an imaginary situation. Sincerely P.

However, a scientist at CICR started a crossing program to transfer BoBt event into other gennplasm. All of her material also has MON53 I. Therefore, MON53 I was already present in the donor material tbat she used in the crossing program. Dr. Dhillon's impression was tbat she bad used T4 plants as donors. Could it be that she used T5 plants instead. Can you please shed some light regarding the same.

The Southern data (T1- and T-4) showed that the BNBt is quite different from Mon 531. T-l Southern was carried out in mid-20OJ and T-4 Southern in early 2005 (samples from the plants probably raised from fresh seeds collected in December 2004/January 2005). What happened/might have happened in 2005-2006: In the following account, I tried to reconstruct a scenario of what happened/might have happened during 2005-2006, which was the crucial transition period.
