 The model has diversified farming components like field crops (cereals, pulses, oilseeds), horticultural crops (vegetables, fruits), livestock (one cow + calf), duckery (20 ducks) along with perennial fodder crops, composting units and central water harvesting pond for composite fish culture and as a source for irrigation during lean season. The IOFS model on 0.43 ha area generate on an average net return of ` 82,450/ year (` 191,744/ha/year) with a B:C ratio of 2.43 which is much higher than that of the region’s RESEARCH FOR TRIBAL AND HILL REGIONS ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 155 farmer common farming practices. On farm nutrient recycling in the IFOS model also supplied approx. 95.8% of the total N requirement, 84% of the total P2O5 requirement and 100% K2O requirement thus making the model near sustainable. The IOFS models were also disseminated to farmers’ field in cluster approach in 3 villages of Ri-bhoi district of Meghalaya covering about 110 ha area and 317 households. Livelihood development under scheduled tribe component (STC; erstwhile TSP): More than 6,503 IOFS model at ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Umiam Vertical cropping over Jalkund in IOFS model tribal farmers from the North Eastern states, i.e. Manipur (544), Megahalaya (708 Nos), Mizoram (502 Nos), Nagaland (232 Nos), Sikkim (2300 Nos.) and Tripura (2,217 Nos) benefitted during reporting period through various livelihood programmes under Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP). A total of 121 numbers of different physical assets, viz. small scale poultry unit (10 Nos), Small scale piggery unit (20 Nos), Poultry house construction under IFS (4 Nos), Cattle shed Construction under IFS (4 Nos), Farm machineries (24 Nos), Bee box (80 Nos), Orchard (Mango, Litchi and Assam Lemon) of 3 Nos, Jalkund (4 Nos), Hatchery unit with accessories (2 Nos), Low cost poly house (4 Nos), Vermi bed (4 Nos), pig breeding unit (2 Nos) were created/distributed in different tribal villages of north east India. Further, 29,600 man-days (267 no. of households) of employment was generated for livelihood security of tribal farmers during the reported period.
