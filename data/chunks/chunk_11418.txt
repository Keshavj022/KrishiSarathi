 Growing carrot once in 3 years by following and growing marigold once in 2 years crop rotation Leaf spot: If infestation is observed in field to control spray Mancozeb@2gm/Litre of water. Brinjal A daily mean temperature of 13-21oC is most favourable for its successful production. The growth of the crop is severely affected when temperature falls below 17oC. It can be grown in plains throughout the year but rabi (October-November) season is the best. Well drained and fertile soil is preferred for the crop. Ideal pH for cultivation of crop is 5.5 - 6.6 Varieties: Pusa Shymala, Pusa Purple Long, Pusa Purple Cluster, Pusa Kranti, Pusa Bhairav, Pusa Anmol (H), Pusa Hybrid 5 (long), Pusa Hybrid 6 & 9 (round), Arka Sheel, Arka Shirish, Arka Kusumkar, Arka Navneet (Hybrid), Arka Nidhi, Arka Keshav, Arka Neelkanth. 370-500g seed required for one ha and seed treatment with Trichoderma viridae/T. harzianum @ 2g /100 g of seeds or Carboxyn 37.5% + Thiram 37.5%. Raised beds of size 7.2 x 1.2 m and 10- 15 cm in height are prepared. Thus, 10 beds required for ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 158 one-hectare area. To avoid mortality of seedlings due to damping off, drenching of the beds with Bavistin (15-20 g/10 litres of water). Seeds are sown at a depth of 2- 3 cm and covered with a fine layer of soil followed by light watering by water can. The seedlings are ready for transplanting within 4-6 weeks of planting when they attain a height of 15 cm with 2-3 true leaves. Long fruited varieties are transplanted at 60 x 45 cm, the round varieties at 75 x 60 cm and high yielding varieties at 90 x 90 cm spacing. 15-20 ton of FYM is incorporated into the soil. Application of 150 kg N, 100 kg P2O5 and 50 kg K2O is recommended for optimum yield. A light irrigation is given on the first and third day after transplanting. Thereafter irrigation is given at an interval of 8-10 days during winter and 5-6 days during summer. Pre- emergence application of Fluchloralin (1.5 kg a.i./ha) coupled with one hand weeding 30 days after transplanting is effective for control of weeds. Delta and yellow sticky traps @ 2-3/ acre should be installed for hoppers, aphids, and white fly etc. Give 2 to 3 sprays of 5 % NSKE against sucking pests. Neem oil (2%) application is also helpful in reducing borer infestation, though marginally, then apply imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 150 ml/ha. Pheromone traps @ 5/ acre should be installed for monitoring and mass trapping of shoot & fruit borer Leucinodes orbonalis. Replace the lures with fresh lures after every 15-20-day interval. Crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops should be followed. Use of green manure, mulching with polythene, soil application with bleaching powder will reduce the infection of bacterial wilt disease. The fruits become ready for first picking in about 120-130 days of seed sowing. Fruits are harvested at an interval of 8-10 days. Average yield of brinjal varies from 20-30 t/ha.
