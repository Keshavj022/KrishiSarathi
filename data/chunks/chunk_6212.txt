 Determination of safe concentrations: Safe concentration of the alcoholic and aqueous extracts of bantulsi were determined by using 1, 10, 100, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 mg/ml in BHK2| cell monolayer for 96 hr. Determination of viable cells: The confluent monolayers of both BHK21 and vero cells were treated with different concentrations (indicated below) with appropriate controls and then incubated in an incubator at 37°C for 72 hr under 5% CO2. After the incubation period, the cells were treated with trypsin to detach the cells from the surface, which were then stained with 0.4% Trypan blue. Antiviral activity against blue-tongue virus serotype: Preliminarily, the vero cells were put for 24 hr in a 24 well cell culture plate (Nunc). The cells were washed with 2% EME medium. Then 100 TCID5(/100 ml of OBTV serotype 23 was infected in duplicates and allowed to adsorb for 1 hr. The unadsorbed virus was removed by washing the cell monolayers with 2% EME medium. Further, the monolayers were fed with different concentrations of bantulsi alcoholic and aqueous extracts separately with appropriate virus and cell controls. The plates were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 72 hr and the readings were noted. Antiviral activity against goat-pox virus: The experiment was conducted as above for GPV, i.e. by using both direct and indirect methods for all the extracts. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Determination of safe concentration showed that 100, 500, and 1000 mg/ml bantulsi alcoholic extract did not change the morphology of both BHK,t and vero cells for 96 hr and 120 hr respectively, whereas the concentrations 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 mg/ml induced rounding and detachment of cells as early as at 24 hr both in BHK21 and vero cell lines. Its aqueous extract at 100,500, and 1,000 mg/ml concentrations did not change the morphology of both BHK21 and vero cells for 96 and 120 hr respectively, whereas that of 4,000 mg/ml induced rounding and detachment of cells as early as at 24 hr, 3,000 mg/ml after 48 hr and 2,000 mg/ml after 72 hr both in BHK2] and vero cell lines. The total, viable and percentage of viable cells Table 1. Total and viable cell count at different concentrations of bantulsi Contents VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY were counted or calculated and the results are given in Table 1. Antiviral activity: Bantulsi aqueous extract at different concentrations was found non-inhibitory to blue-tongue and GPV, because virus titres remained the same in treated as well as control wells. Experiment WBUAFS The trial was conducted in total 11 clinical cases of FMD. The paste from leaves of bantulsi was prepared by using an electric grinder. The paste was applied on the foot lesions twice daily for a maximum period of 10-12 days or till recovery was noticed.
