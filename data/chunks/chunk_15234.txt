 This stage is pivotal to guaran- tee the precision and dependability of subsequent assessments. 3. Data analysis: Data analytics techniques are applied to analyze the preprocessed sensor data. Statistical meth- ods can provide descriptive insights, while AI models can uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that might not be apparent through conventional approaches. 4. Decision making: The results obtained from data anal- ysis can inform decision-making processes in various domains. For instance, in industrial settings, real-time sensor data analysis can optimize manufacturing pro- cesses, improve predictive maintenance, and enhance overall efﬁciency [19].

Anomaly detection: AI-powered anomaly detection can identify unusual patterns or deviations in sensor data, which could indicate potential faults, security breaches, or abnormal environmental conditions. 7. Feedback loop: Smart sensor systems can use the ana- lyzed data and insights to adjust their operations or calibrate sensors for better accuracy, leading to con- tinuous improvement. The integration of data analyt- ics and AI is vital for unlocking the full potential of smart sensor data. It enables businesses, industries, and cities to harness the power of real-time information, optimize operations, improve safety, and enhance overall efﬁciency, ultimately leading to more sustain- able and intelligent systems. 3.3. Creating Predictive Models for Precision Farming Decisions. Creating predictive models for precision farming decisions is a powerful application of data analytics and AI in agriculture [20]. The process of creating predictive models for precision farming decisions typically involves the following steps shown in Figure 3 as a process diagram. By creating accurate predictive models, precision farm- ing can make conscious decisions to optimize resource utili- zation, reduce waste, lessen environmental repercussions, and ultimately increase productivity and proﬁtability for farmers. These data-driven insights empower farmers to make more precise and efﬁcient decisions, leading to sustain- able agriculture practices, and a more resilient food supply chain. 4. Recent Innovations in Smart Sensor Technologies Recent innovations in smart sensor technologies have signif- icantly advanced precision agriculture, allowing farmers to make data-driven decisions for improved efﬁciency, produc- tivity, and sustainability.
