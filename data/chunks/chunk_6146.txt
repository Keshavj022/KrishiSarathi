 METHODOLOGY Initially the experiment was conducted in farmers' fields at Khaspokharia village, Tantanagar block in West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand during 2003-04 and also in 2004-05 cropping seasons. The experiment was also conducted at Central Research Farm, BCKVV, Gayeshpur, Nadia (West Bengal) during 2004-05 for cross-validation of the results obtained at Khaspokharia village. Field experiments At Khaspokharia village the experiment was carried out in randomized block design (RBD) with four treatments in 15 replications for validation of ITK. The treatments were: T1, control; T2, application of parsa leaves @ 100 kg/ha; T3, application of sali leaves @ 100 kg/ha; and T4, application of chlorpyriphos @ 1.0 litre/ha. Each farmer represented one replication with four plots four treatments. Each plot size was within the range of 500-1000 m2. Observations were taken on number of total leaves, damaged leaves and number of caseworm leaves/hill after 30 and 60 days of treatment (DAT). Rice seeds of local varieties were used. About 30-35-day-old seedlings were transplanted in the field. Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE At Central Research Farm, BCKV also, the experiment was conducted following RBD with 4 treatments each, being replicated 7 times for the control of rice caseworm. The treatments were: T1, parasi leaves @ 100 kg/ha; T2, sali leaves @ 100 kg/ha; T3, chlorpyriphos at 0.05% a. i., and T4, control. Thirty-day-old seedlings of rice variety IET 4786 (Shatabdi) were transplanted on 27 July 2004 in plots measuring 5 x 3 m at a spacing of 20 x 15 cm. The crop was manured with N: P: K @ 80: 50: 50. Irrigation was given as and when required to maintain standing water in the field. Fresh parasi and sali leaves were spread over the standing water in plots at 7 DAT (days after transplanting). Chlorpyriphos was sprayed twice, at 7 and 22 DAT. Observations were taken from all the hills of 0.5 m2 area at two locations in each plot at 15 days interval starting from 15 days after treatment. Counts were taken on total number of leaves in each hill and those showing infestation by case- worm. The number of leaf cases bearing larvae was also counted. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Results obtained from the experiment conducted on 15 farmers' fields during 2003-04 and 2004-05 cropping seasons are presented in Table 1. At 30 DAT minimum mean caseworm infestation (30.9%) was recorded in T4, i.e. application of chlorpyriphos @ 1.0 litre/ha compared with 81.3% in control during two cropping seasons (2003-04 and 2004-05). Treatment T4 was followed by application of parasi leaves @ 100 kg/ha (T2,), which recorded 58.1% caseworm infestation. Data revealed that all the treatments were significantly superior to control. At 60 DAT also data showed that treatment T4 recorded minimum mean caseworm infestation (9.4%), which was statistically superior to control. All the treatments were significantly superior to control.
