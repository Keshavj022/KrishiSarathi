, Sokhodeora, Block Kawakol, Nawada (Bihar) Methodology Location Village Sokhodeora, Block Kawakol, Nawada (Bihar) PRA and field study PRA method was applied to determine the efficacy of sinduar leaves in controlling the insect-pest of stored grain/seed with randomly selected 20 respondents, who were using this practice. The efficacy of the ITK was assessed in terms of extent of control of stored grain, germination percentage, duration of control, cost effectiveness, simplicity in use, availability and choice of the farmers in comparison to the use of recommended chemical pesticide. Experiment An experiment was initiated in April 2003 with 20 replications in villages of Kawakol, Tikodih and Sokhodeora to assess the effectiveness of sinduar leaves in controlling stored grain pests of wheat in three sets of conditions having three treatments in each condition. Thus altogether 9 treatments were taken into consideration under CRD design. The treatments were; T1-Grain/seed stored in gunny bag without any treatment; T2- Grain/seed stored in earthen pitcher without any treatment: T3- Grain/  GRAIN/SEED STORAGE seed stored in metal bin without any treatment, T4- Grain/seed stored in gunny bag with sinduar leaves @ 1.0 kg/q of grain, T5- Grain/seed stored in earthen pitcher with sinduar leaves @ 1.0 kg/q grain, T6- Grain/seed stored in metal bin with sinduar leaves @ 1.0 kg/q grain, T7- Grain/seed stored in gunny bag with chemical pesticide (aluminium phosphide @ 4 tablets/q grain); T8- Grain/seed stored in earthen pitcher with chemical pesticide (aluminium phosphide @ 4 tab/q of grain) and T9- Grain/seed stored in metal bin with chemical pesticide (aluminium phosphide @ 4 tab/q grain). All the treatments received similar condition i.e. they were kept in cool and dry place inside the house. Observations were taken on percentage of infested grains and germination percentage after five months of storage during the first week of September, 2003. was found when the grains were stored in gunny bag without any treatment, whereas least (3%) infestation was recorded when it was stored in metal bin with chemical/pesticides (aluminium phosphide). There was no difference in insect infestation in stored grains in metal bin either with sinduar leaves or with aluminium phosphide. Grains stored in metal bin and earthen pitcher, either with sinduar leaves or with aluminium phosphide, showed better germination (87-98%) of seeds. Table 2.
