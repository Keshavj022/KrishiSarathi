 Divide the field into kiyaras (plot) of desirable size after laser land levelling and apply pre-sowing (rauni) irrigation and prepare field when it comes to tar-wattar (good soil moisture) condition and immediately sow the crop with rice seed drill fitted with inclined plate metering system or Lucky seed drill (for simultaneously sowing and spray of herbicide) by using 20 to 25 kg seed/ha in 20 cm spaced rows. The seed should be placed at 2-3 cm depth. Before sowing, treat rice seed with 3 g Sprint 75 WS (mencozeb + carbendazim) by dissolving in 10-12 ml water per kg seed; make paste of fungicide solution and rub on the seed.   For controlling weeds, spray 2.5 litre per hectare pendimethalin 30 EC in 500 litres of water in moist soil within two days of sowing. It should be followed by 250 ml/ha bispyribac 10 SC if the crop is infested with swank and paddy mothas or 40 g/ha of azimsulfuron 50 DF or 20 g/ ha metsulfuron methyl +chlorimuron ethyl 20 WP (Almix) if the crop is infested with paddy mothas including gandi wala motha and broadleaf weeds at 20-25 days of sowing in 350-400 litres of water.   Apply 130 kg urea/acre in three equal splits at 4, 6 and 9 weeks after sowing. Phosphorus and potash should be applied only if the soil test shows deficiency of these nutrients. Skip phosphorus application to DSR if recommended dose of phosphorus had been applied to the preceding wheat crop.   Apply first irrigation at 21 days after sowing and schedule succeeding irrigations as per monsoon rains.   Start giving copious irrigations as soon as chlorosis (iron deficiency) appears and give 2 or 3 sprays of one per cent ferrous sulphate solution at weekly intervals (2.5 kg of ferrous sulphate in 250 litres of water per hectare). Basmati Rice  For Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) of Basmati: Pusa Basmati 1121, Pusa Basmati 1509, Punjab Basmati 7 and Pusa Basmati 1718 are most suitable varieties. The optimum sowing time for Basmati under DSR is second fortnight of June (15-30 June).   Apply135 kg urea per hectarein three equal splits at3, 6 and 9 weeks aftersowing. Phosphorus and potash should be applied only if the soil test shows deficiency of these nutrients. Skip phosphorus application if recommended dose ofphosphorus had been applied to the preceding wheat crop.   For Basmati varieties like Punjab Basmati 7, 5, 4, 3 and 2, Pusa Basmati 1121, 1637 and 1718, the optimum time of nursery sowing is 1st fortnight of June and transplanting time is 1st fortnight of July whereas, for CSR 30, Basmati 370, Basmati 386, Pusa Basmati 1509, the optimum time of nursery sowing is 2nd fortnight of June and transplanting time is 2nd fortnight of July. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 11   Seed and seedling treatment is mandatory to control dreaded disease like foot rot. Smear the seeds with talc formulation of Trichoderma harzianum@ 15 g per kg of seed immediately before sowing and seedling root dip for 6 hrs with T.
