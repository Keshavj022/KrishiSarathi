 The results provide a picture of the current situation and guide further research for the containment of AMR under the One Health approach. Inadequate multi-sectoral and cross-disciplinary efforts to combating AMR in current practice call for prompt coordinated action integral to a “One Health approach.” 1. Introduction Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an emerging global public health issue. Globally, the rise of AMR has been attributed largely to the misuse and abuse of antimicrobials in veterinary, human, and agricultural medicine [1–5]. The increasing resistance to current antimicrobials leads to ineffectiveness or long duration in terms of treatment hence causing increased morbidity and mortality. Antimicrobial resistance can prevail through the food chain and in the environment [6]. Therefore, understanding the role of the agriculture, food and environmental sec­ tors is important in preventing infections in both animals and humans and the further development and spread of AMR. [7]. In order to adequately address AMR, a “One Health” integrated approach is advised including animal, human and environmental health sectors [8]. Ulti­ mately, tackling AMR through One Health is critical in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, focusing on good health, responsible consumption, conservation of life on land, and fostering partnerships.

Cur­ rent trends predict India to be among the countries with the highest volume of antibiotic usage in food animals [10]. Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria can be transferred directly from food animals to human beings, through contaminated food, or indirectly through contaminated envi­ ronments [11]. Consequences of infection include long hospital stays, increased mortalities, loss of protection for patients requiring surgery, and increased treatment costs [12]. “One Health” mitigation approaches that engage relevant sectors, are thus imperative.
