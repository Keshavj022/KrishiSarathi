 The socio-economic survey reveals that more than 60% of the inhabitants lived below the poverty line. The people are economically poor and backward. They earn their livelihoods mostly from agriculture and the collection of minor forest products. The entire selected village cluster has a sloppy landscape and is characterized by rainfed and primarily monocropping with only rainfed kharif paddy. The FFP technological interventions were implemented through five modules, namely, Crop- based, NRM-based, Horticulture-based, Livestock- based and Enterprise-based, including providing skill training, conducting demonstrations and other capacity- building activities for all the farmers and farm women. Profile of the successful farm woman Smt Gitanjali Naik, a 47 year-old tribal farm woman with a small family and senior secondary education qualification, comes from the tribal-dominated Jamuda village in Saharpada block of Keonjhar district in Odisha. Jamuda is characteristically considered as an underdeveloped and downtrodden village having a population of 2,170 persons, of whom 1,671 are from scheduled tribes (77.0%), 439 scheduled castes (20.23%) and only 60 (2.76%) are from general category. Prior to the implementation of Farmer FIRST Programme of ICAR-IIWM in the cluster during 2016-17, Smt Gitanjali Naik was cultivating only paddy during rainy season Indian Farming 74 (11): 50-54; November 2024 Indian Farming 51 November 2024 using local and indigenous varieties through traditional practices besides some local vegetables in her backyard for her familyâ€™s consumption purpose. Due to lack of knowledge in management of rainwater, pest and disease problems, and a balanced dose of fertilizers at critical stages of crop growth, besides non-availability of irrigation facility, her paddy crop was damaged more or less every year. Because of these multiple problems, she was getting very poor yields with a total production of only ~ 75 quintal paddy from an area of 5.0 acres of land with a gross income of ` 75,000, and a net annual income of ~ ` 15,000-20,000, while her rest 1.5 acre upland was unutilized. Additionally, she was earning about `3,500- 4,000/annum by rearing one non-descript indigenous cow, rearing 2-3 desi goats and selling surplus cow milk, totalling a net annual income of about `19,000-24,000. Turning point of the successful journey After coming in contact with the project scientists during 2016-17 through attending awareness cum skill training programmes, getting critical agricultural inputs and proper technical guidance, she started growing high-yielding and hybrid paddy adopting proper nursery management, line transplanting and SRI method, mechanical weed control through use of cono- weeders and application of balanced fertilizers, her paddy production increased significantly in succeeding years to reach 105 quintals from the same area.
