 This practice is being followed by a good number of farmers belonging to Kapgari village under Jhargram subdivision in Midnapur district of West Bengal. This practice has been in vogue over generations without any modification and is being followed in patches vulnerable to insect-pest incidence. Rice gundhi bug infests paddy at the milk stage. It sucks the milk, leaving the grain chaffy or partially chaffy, depending upon the extent of infestation. It generally appears in damaging level during rainy (kharif) season in the early maturing varieties that mature during 1st or 2nd week of October. Dr G. B.

Implantation of parasi twig in farmer's field (Balasore) Fig. 2. Healthy grains (left) and gundhi bug-infested grains (right) Contents PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT Ajodhya village, Balasore (Orissa). In the research station, 30-day-old seedlings were transplanted in randomized block design for 6 treatments each with 4 replications. Fertilizer was applied @ 60:30:30 kg NPK/ha. Twigs of parasi were implanted @ 5/plot (25 m2) and leaves were applied @ 100 kg/ha. Malathion dust was applied @ 25kg/ ha. Observations were taken on population of gundhi bug (after 5 and 10 days of treatment by sweeping net method) and yield of rice. In farmers' fields, only 3 treatments each with 10 replications were taken, i.e. implanting parasi twigs, applying insecticides and untreated control. twigs or leaves. Accordingly, the yield was also highest in the treatment. But a significant increase in yield was not obtained in parasi treatment than in untreated control. Experiments conducted during 2003 showed that insect incidence was less and irregular in farmers' fields. Parasi twigs were implanted when the insect population was 1/m2 But it did not increase subsequently, as is clear from the data on 10 DAT. However, insect population was found to decrease in parasi treatment in comparison to untreated control (Table 1). Yield was also more though not significant. Yield data during 2003 were much influenced by rain and subsequent flood. Hence Table 1.
