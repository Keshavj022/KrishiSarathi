 After the yolk sac is reabsorbed, the fries, now measuring 1500±90 µm, begin to rise to the surface for active feeding. To ensure the robust growth of pearlspot fish fry, a consistent feeding regimen is crucial. Employing a specially formulated dust feed with 40% protein and 10% fat at both dawn and dusk proves to be an effective strategy. Feeding in close proximity to dip nets plays a crucial role in conditioning the fry, encouraging them to gather near the nets. This conditioning significantly enhances the efficiency of harvesting, ensuring a seamless harvesting whenever required. Parental care The brood fishes create small pits in the pond bottom to provide a secure space for the tiny hatchlings, shielding them from potential predators. These brood fishes exhibit parental care by relocating the seeds from one pit to another at different intervals, demonstrating a protective behaviour. This involves keeping the fry in small pits near the egg colonies on the pond bottom for 4 to 5 days. The early separation of pearlspot fry from their parents facilitates subsequent spawning at an earlier stage.The school of fish fries adopts a spherical shape while moving during the first month after hatching, possibly as a natural defensive mechanism to deter predatory fishes. The transition from the fry stage to reaching a marketable size seed can take approximately 2 months. Predator control The presence of predatory weed fishes, such as Etroplus maculatus, frequently diminishes the seed survival percentage. Despite attempts to eradicate these weed fishes during pond preparation, certain eggs or larvae persist, grow in the ponds, and subsequently function as predators. In the event of a surge in the population of weed fishes within the breeding ponds, their elimination may need to be carried out twice a year by resetting the pond and repeating all the pond preparation procedures. As birds prey on fish larvae and fry on a massive scale in breeding ponds, the top surface of the ponds needs to be covered with 1.25 mm thick Seed production in natural ponds Producing seeds in pond systems incur significantly lower investments and operational expenses when compared to hatchery systems. However, the yield in pond systems tends to be substantially lower due to challenges such as water quality issues and attacks by predators. Natural pond conditions significantly influence successful egg production, emphasizing the importance of well-prepared ponds. Pond preparation involves several steps, including de-watering, removal of excess humus, and eradication of weed fish using tea seed cake (at the rate of 5 g perm’ pond area). Subsequently, the pond bottom needs to be sun-dried. Afterwards, powdered dolomite is applied (at the rate of 100 g per m’ pond area) as a liming material to correct acidity and enhance phosphorus and carbon content, promoting higher phytoplankton production.
