 It was found that owing to its design the visible area to operator was lower as compared to normal tractor (without cabin). Area not visible to tractor operator was found to be 159.79 m2. The modifications in existing design resulted in increase of transparent area by 29.71, 59.41 and 38.76% in the modified tractor cabin towards front, rear and left and right side, respectively. An overall improvement of 40.48% was achieved in the transparent area after making all the design changes in the existing tractor cabin. Area not visible to tractor operator improved from 159.79 m2 to 102.89 m2 with modifications in tractor cabin. MECHANIZATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 89 speed was found to be 36 kg/h, 5 mm and 7.12 m/s. The cleaning parameters, viz. sieve slope, stroke length and stroke frequency were also optimized. The sieve slope 3.50°, stroke length 20 mm and frequency 400strokes/ min was found to be optimum. The developed thresher was tested with Dapoli1 variety of finger millet crop having moisture content and grain straw ratio as 11% (db) and 3:1, respectively. The threshing efficiency, pearling efficiency, grain damage, cleaning efficiency, total grain loss and energy consumption were recorded as 99.5%, 99%, 0.7%, 97.5%, 1.6% and 0.7 kWh, respectively. Development of two row disc type ratoon management device: The cultural operations, ratoon initiation operations, were performed in the field free from sugarcane trash. Now-a-days, sugarcane trash is left in the field after harvesting. For carrying out ratoon initiation operations, prototype of a new machine, tractor operated two row disc ratoon management device, was developed. Main feature of the machine was its off barring discs which perform efficiently even in the field having leftover surface trash. Field capacity of the machine was 0.30 to 0.35 ha/h. Animal draught power Weeder-cum-fertilizer applicator: The developed, animal drawn weeder-cum-fertilizer applicator is suitable for top dressing of granular urea in widely spaced crops, such as cotton crop planted at spacing of 900 mm × 600 mm. There is provision to vary application rate of urea by changing exposure length of fluted roller as per requirement. It applies fertilizer at a distance of 78±9 mm from plant, whereas average length of fertilizer band was 9.5±1.3 mm. The field capacity, field efficiency and draught of implement at forward speed of 1.8 km/h are 0.12 ha/h, 74.9% and 450–600 N, respectively. Also, the fertilizer application efficiency is 91% and weeding efficiency is 84.5%. Production and post-harvest operation of maize: A package of bullock drawn implements comprising MB plough, stubble collector, seed drill, fertilizer applicator- cum-ridger and maize dehusker-cum-sheller were developed for hilly terrain. The field capacity of MB plough is 0.02 ha/h with 65.8% field efficiency.
