 A technical bulletin entitled, “Status of Cashew Germplasm Collection in India” was published. Total number of cashew accessions conserved in NCGB is raised to 473 and 1,188 in regional cashew gene bank (RCGB). The correlation analysis of flowering and fruiting characters vis-a-vis yield/tree over the last 4 years showed that fruiting intensity and nut yield/m2 of canopy are most important yield characters and hence these characters can be used for evaluating breeding material for improvement of nut yield/tree. The performance of S 15/14 (1/3 Ceylon self) and H 24/4 (BLA 139-1 × A 18/4) were found better for cumulative yield and annual yield respectively. BLA 139-1 and V 4 had higher carbohydrate content, and BPP 5 and V 1 had more sugar and fibre content. Auxillary shoot bud proliferation (1-12 buds/explant) was induced on MS medium containing thidiazuron from shoot explants of matured tree origin. Micrografting was successful even with microscions of less than 5 cm length. A low-frequency somatic embryogenesis was observed on callus from nucellus induced on medium containing 2, 4-D and kinetin. Suspension culture from embryogenic calli resulted in high frequency regeneration of somatic embryos. Isozyme extraction from leaves was standardized. Staining prototcol for 6 isozymes were worked out. Recyclable biomass from cashew garden after mixing with cowdung slurry could be converted into vermicompost rich in N, P, K and micronutrients by earthworm Eudrilus sp. within 3 months. Sesbania grown as green manure crop in one-year-old cashew orchard contributed maximum green biomass which is equal to 48 kg N, 7.2 kg P2O5 and 9.8 kg K2O/ha. Under high-density trial, at 4 m × 4 m spacing gave 1.3 tonnes/ha yield at CRS, Bapatla. V 4 gave SUCCESS STORY REMUNERATIVE CASHEW PRODUCTION In cashew, a net profit of Rs 77,054, 73,735, 70,050 and 58,790/ha was obtained in high-density planting, accommodating 625, 500, 400 and 384 trees/ha respectively, for the initial 12 years, compared to Rs 31,278/ha in normal planting density (156 trees/ha). The biomass of dried branches in high-density planting was 10 times more than widely spaced trees. Weed biomass collected from high-density planting was significantly lesser than low-density planting. Total biomass per hectare-basis was higher in high-density planting compared to low-density planting. Organic-matter content available in soil up to 1 m depth and soil moisture level at the top 0–30 cm were higher in high-density planting. Heavy deposit of cashew leaves under high- density planting system when incorporated in soil will be a good source of nutrients for better plant growth and yield. Thus a package of practices for high-density planting has been developed for farmers, and a technical bulletin, High-Density Planting of Cashew, has been published. To popularize this technology, farmers’ participatory research-cum-demonstration plots were laid out at farmers’ fields.
