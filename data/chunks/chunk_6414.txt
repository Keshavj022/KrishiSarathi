 Gross returns (GR) and net returns (NR) were also high in chilli (GR-R 3,96,297/ ha and R 2,06,297/ha) followed by turmeric (GR- R 3,56,180/ha and NR- R 1,76,180/ha) compared to fallow tobacco (GR- R 2,69,698/ha and NR- R 1,44,498/ha). Sugarcane settling transplanting technology: A sugarcane cultivation model combining nine improved sugarcane cultivation practices named as Sugarcane Settling Transplanting Technology (STT) was established at ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore, and was evaluated for reducing cultivation cost, improving productivity, increasing profitability and ensuring sustainability in sugarcane agriculture over conventional method. involved in imparting salinity tolerance, an experiment was undertaken with groundnut variety TG37A and two of its C3-CAM transited and drought tolerant variants with soil salinity level of around 3.95 at harvest. It was found that while imposition of salinity at 3.95 of soil EC reduced the biomass production in the cultivar TG37A by almost 48% (6,143 kg/ha in normal soil condition to 3,208 kg/ha in around 3.95 soil EC in TG37A), the over-expressive C3-CAM transited variants of TG37A like DGRMB19 minimized the biomass reduction (6,787 kg/ha on normal condition to 4,777 kg/ha) and maintained at 30% level of reduction. Both the CAM transited genotypes performed significantly superior than TG37A. Long-term effect of sewage water irrigation on heavy metal accumulation in soil-fodder-animal continuum: The soil, fodder, animal milk and blood samples were collected from long-term sewage water- irrigated peri-urban areas of Kanpur, Varanasi and Bhopal. Soil, fodder, milk, and blood samples of animals were analyzed for heavy metals, viz. chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). The heavy metal contents in the sewage water-irrigated soil were within the safe limit except for the sewage water-irrigated surface soil of Varanasi, while Ni content has crossed the maximum permissible limit (20 mg/kg) in the soil at all the locations. Irrespective of locations, heavy metals accumulation was higher in fodder bajra (Cr, Ni and Pb, 8.36-13.17, 7.78-9.20, 7.53-7.54 ppm, respectively), followed by fodder sorghum (Cr, Ni and Pb, 10.66-10.29, 5.21- 5.36, 5.62-6.60 ppm, respectively), berseem (Cr, Ni and Pb, 9.46-9.51, 4.28-4.43, 5.17-6.65 ppm, respectively) and fodder maize (Cr, Ni and Pb, 9, 4.13, 5 ppm, respectively). Furthermore, the residue levels of Cd and Pb in animal milk (0.189-0.199 and 0.267-0.296 ppm Cd and Pb, respectively) and blood (0.088-0.257 and 0.520-2.486 ppm Cd and Pb, respectively) samples were found to be higher than the maximum permissible limit in Kanpur and Bhopal, except for Cr in blood samples in both locations, which was lower than the maximum permissible limit (1.0 mg/L). Irrigation with sewage water increases fodder yield and the quality because of its high nutrient content.
