 The G20 is working to improve digital infrastructure in rural areas and to address the digital divide between urban and rural areas, (ii) Data governance: The G20 is working to develop frameworks for data governance in agriculture, including data privacy and security, to ensure that digital technologies are used responsibly and ethically, (iii) Standards and interoperability: The G20 is working to develop standards and interoperability frameworks for digital agriculture to ensure that different technologies can work together to promote the development of open data platforms, (iv) Capacity building: The G20 is working to improve capacity building in digital agriculture, including training for farmers and extension workers, to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge to adopt and use digital technologies effectively and (v) Financing: The G20 recognizes the importance of financing for the adoption of digital technologies in agriculture and is working to increase investment in digital infrastructure and technologies. During G20 presidency held in Indonesia in 2022, G20 Policy Framework for an Equitable and Environmentally Sustainable Transition for digitalization of agriculture Indian Farming 34 June 2023 has been discussed extensively. In G20 Meeting of Agricultural Chief Scientists (MACS) in Varanasi recently during the presidency of India, deliberations were held on Digital Agriculture and Sustainable Agri Value Chain and Public-Private Partnership. Digital agriculture is an area of growing importance in the G20, and there is a growing recognition of the potential benefits of digital technologies in agriculture. The G20 is working to promote the adoption of digital technologies in agriculture and to address the challenges and barriers to adoption. Challenges in adoption The major challenges in adoption of these technologies are: • Extent of profitability should be beyond of a threshold through in usage of the technology; • Amount of uncertainty and risk involved in adopting a technology including cost of the technology; • Availability and suitability of technology in the agricultural production cycle; • Requirement of skills and learning curve for adoption of the technology; • Eco-environment and digital infrastructure availability in a particular region; • Level of agricultural production system; • Ease of flow of agricultural credits, and • Overall policy support for promotion of a technology. SUMMARY There is an increasing use of electronic extension services and social media in developing countries to share planting advice, weather updates, early disaster warnings and pest outbreak. Studies shows that technologies are being adopted separately and integrated and packaged together to address the specific problems of agricultural production. It was also reported that rate of adoption of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) was highest in the US, UK, Australia and Denmark, with rates as high as 60% in the US and 77% in Australia.
