10 to 0.13 ha/h. The equipment saves 90% 12 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Agricultural Engineering www.icar.org.in operating time and 33% in cost of weeding as compared to hand weeding by Khurpi. 4.10. Tractor operated aero blast sprayer: The sprayer is mounted on the tractor 3‐point linkage and is operated by tractor PTO. Machine can cover about 1.7 ha/h at a speed of 1.5 km/h. Application of sprayer can be varied from 100‐400 litres/ha depending upon different valve setting. Effective width of sprayer is found to be about 13.0‐m distance. The cost of operation of this machine is Rs. 500/ha as against Rs. 700/ha by conventional method. 4.11. Self‐propelled walking type vertical conveyor reaper: Self‐propelled vertical conveyor reaper is used for harvesting cereal crops like wheat and paddy. It cuts the crop, conveys it vertically to one side and drops in a windrow for easy collection. The field capacity of the machine is 0.15 ‐ 0.17 ha /h. Use of this machine results in saving of 90 –95% in labour, time and cost of operation as compared to conventional method. The cost of operation is Rs. 650/ha with this machine as against Rs. 2000/ha by traditional method. 4.12. Tractor mounted vertical conveyor reaper: The machine is mounted in the front of a tractor and is used for harvesting cereal crops like wheat and paddy. It cuts the crop, conveys it vertically to one side and drops in a windrow for easy collection. The field capacity of the machine is 0.4 ha/h when operated at forward speed of 2.5‐3.5 km/h. The cost of operation is about Rs. 1000/‐ as against Rs. 2000/ha by traditional method. 4.13. Tractor mounted fodder harvester: Flail type mower‐cum‐chopper for fodder crop is capable of harvesting, chopping and loading of fodder crops such as maize, bajra, oats in a trailer, attached behind the machine. The capacity of the machine is 0.20 ha/h at a forward speed of 2.5‐4.0 km/h. The cost of operation of this machine is Rs. 1500/ha against Rs. 2000/ha by conventional method. 4.14. Power operated axial flow sunflower thresher: The thresher has an axial flow system and the material flows parallel to the axis of the threshing cylinder. The machine is operated by 7.5 hp motor and has a capacity of 8.0 q/h clean grains. The threshing efficiency of the thresher is more than 99 percent. There is a saving of 85% in labour, 75% in time and 30% in cost of operation. The cost of operation of this machine is Rs. 450/t and Rs. 1000/t with conventional method. 4.15. Power operated maize dehusker‐cum‐sheller: Maize dehusker‐ cum‐threshers namely spike tooth type (modified version of wheat thresher) and axial flow type (modified version of sunflower thresher) have been developed for threshing maize along with the husk. The percent recovery of grain with machine is 97 percent as compared to 78.4 % by manual threshing. There is a saving of about 60‐70% in cost and about 90% in labour as compared to the traditional methods of dehusking and threshing.
