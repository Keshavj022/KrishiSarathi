Solid state biogas plant in a village Biogas run kitchen of a progressive farmer 3.3 Biphasic System for Biomethanation of Vegetable Market Waste The vegetable market waste is normally disposed‐off along with other municipal waste. Hence, efforts were made to convert vegetable market waste into methane rich biogas and compost. Acid rich leachate is produced from vegetable market waste (VMW) and used for methane generation. Water requirement is very low. Partially digested VMW is converted into compost in around 60 days. Mechanical materials handling sub‐systems are provided in large plants of 2‐20 tons VMW /day capacity. Biogas may be used for thermal / mechanical power application. Beside compost, 1.5 ‐ 2.0 m3 / d of biogas (methane content 70%) is produced per 100 kg of VMW handled. It is suitable for all regions where weekly average ambient temperature for winter months is above 15oC. Its approximate cost is Rs 4.5‐7.0 lakh/ton/d capacity. The pay back period is around three years for 2 ton /day plant. It reduces with increase in capacity of the plant. A full scale system to process 3 ton / d VMW of Sardar Patel Vegetable Market, Anand (Gujarat State) is under operation. 2 22 Researc www.ica 3.4 Solar The solar temperat along with 7oC can b power co conventio compress Importan Compress h 24 V, Po 70 C, 7 set h Achieveme ar.org.in Refrigrator refrigerator ure in standa h the battery be maintaine onsumption v onal AC refrig sor and is com t Specificati sor – Danfoss ower Consum ttings Solar Refr nts of AICRPs has been des alone mode.
