 Soybean: A core set of 710 accessions was developed using 8 agro-morphological traits as variables following Principal Component Score (PCS) and Power Core method. This core set constitutes about 20.62% of 3,443 accessions. Castor: Four castor entries, RG 43, RG 631, RG 2661 and RG 3060, were confirmed for resistance to leafhopper (hopper burn grade 0 to 1) on a 0-4 scale. Linseed: Flax genotype JRF 4 was identified for better fibre quality based on the strength and fineness. Three temperature-tolerant lines A 98, GS 54 and GS 428 were found promising based on the stay- green colour and seed yield. Leafhopper resistant acession of castor, RG 3060 Malla Bamboo IC0618555 16012 Tolerance to waterlogging (Bambusa vulgaris) Fingermillet IC0614156 16014 High calcium content (452.8 mg/100g) (Eleusine coracana) Cauliflower (Brassica IC0614417 16015 Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS); good seed yield; cream- oleracea var. botrytis) coloured flowers IC0614418 16016 Maintainer line IC0614419 16017 Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS); cream-coloured flowers IC0614420 16018 Maintainer line Groundnut IC0616376 16019 Spanish bunch with extra-large kernels Lemon grass IC0619026 16020 High herbage yield with high essential oil content (Cymbopogon citratus) Java citronella IC0619027 16021 High herbage yield with high essential oil content (Cymbopogon winterianus) Crop National identity INGR No Novel unique features Bradyrhizobial cultures from root nodules of drought- tolerant soybean Five bradyrhizobial cultures were obtained from the root nodules of drought- tolerant soybean varieties and characterized based on the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile and 16 S rRNA gene sequence; and were identified through NCBI BLAST.

A total of 328 microbial cultures were preserved in a long-term storage during the year. chloride treatment @ 160 milli moles resulted in reduction in growth of above ground biomass in all the five germplasm. The minimum growth reduction was recorded in IC 318707 (1.57%), followed by IC 318706 (8.50%) as compared to Bhagwa (24.00%). Hence, IC 318707 is identified as salinity tolerant rootstock. Three germplasm accessions of date palm from ICARDA, Jordan, and 144 plants of date palm cv. Medjool as a diplomatic gift to the Honourable President of India from State of Palestine were received and conserved. In addition, 25 accessions of Manila tamarind (Pithecellobium dulce), four accessions of mulberry (Morus sp.
