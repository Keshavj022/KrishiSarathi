 During 2014-15, the Directorate was renamed as ICAR-Indian Institute of Farming Systems Research and organic farming programme was further strengthened in 2015-16 by increasing the number of centres under All India Network Programme on Organic Farming from 13 to 20. Several technologies including package of practices for cropping systems, identification of varieties and integrated organic farming systems have been developed under the scheme. Some of the achievements with impact are highlighted below. 6. Technologies Developed for Organic Farming 6.1. Package of Practices (PoPs) Scientific package of practices for 51 cropping systems suitable for 12 states for organic production of crops in cropping systems perspective have been developed. These packages results in higher productivity in majority of the crops compared to the traditional or indigenous farming practices in niche areas (rainfed, hilly) and crops. For example, the productivity obtained with developed PoPs are 3.9 t ha-1 in coarse rice, 3.2 t ha-1 in basmati rice, 4.1 t ha-1 in wheat and 22.3 t ha-1 in potato. Productivity of majority of the crops obtained under scientific organic farming packages is greater than the countrywide average productivity of major crops. Developed packages have been shared with Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare under Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare for up-scaling through developmental schemes of Government of India such as Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana 91 (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development in North Eastern hill region. Around 1 lakh farmers having 70,000 ha area have been federated into 130 FPOs under MOVCD-NER to whom the technological backstopping is being provided through the scheme. Table 1. Yield ratio of organic and inorganic production systems in multi-location trials. Crops Number of observations Yield ratio Crops Number of observations Yield ratio Basmati rice 67 1.04 Okra 10 1.18 Rice 52 1.00 Chilli 12 1.09 Maize 37 1.10 Onion 13 1.07 Sorghum 17 1.14 Garlic 9 1.04 Greengram 12 1.07 Cauliflower 12 1.04 Chickpea 24 1.00 Cabbage 5 1.11 Soybean 54 1.04 Tomato 11 1.06 Groundnut 16 1.03 Ginger 12 1.20 Pea 21 1.25 Turmeric 18 1.46 Yield recorded at multiple locations under organic over inorganic management reveals that many crops reacted positively to yield higher or comparable (Ravisankar et al. 2016). Mean yield ratio obtained from multi-location trials of various crop groups indicated that organic-to- inorganic (purely synthetic input based management) was 1.04 indicating clear advantage of organic over inorganic production systems (Table 1). 6.2. Improving the diversity & natural enemies Key factor in agricultural systems of India during earlier years was diversity in crops providing stability and resilience besides economic security to the farmers. Gandhiji termed it as natural crop insurance against weather vagaries.
