 A novel approach for yield estimation has also been proposed, leveraging long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for individual trees in commercial orchards. The fluorescent spectrum of citrus juice has been analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which generated an excitation-emission matrix (EEM) for fluorescence intensity. The oBrix/acid ratio of juice extracted from the flesh was estimated using CNN regression, yielding an absolute error of 2.48, significantly enhancing the accuracy of oBrix/acid ratio estimations. Plum: To facilitate the automatic identification of plum varieties at early maturity stages—a task that poses challenges for human experts—a two-step procedure has been implemented. This process involves capturing images to identify the plum region, followed by determining the variety using a deep convolutional neural network, achieving an accuracy of up to 97%. Additionally, a deep learning tool has been developed for analyzing plum varieties through image analysis. This system can differentiate among three plum varieties—Red Beaut, Black Diamond, and Angeleno— with an effectiveness of 92.83%, reaching over 94% accuracy when tested independently on these varieties, which exhibit different ripening cycles. Furthermore, a classification system has been designed to categorize Horvin plums, including samples that may be visually impaired, providing an affordable and high-performance selection system for technology-deprived areas. Strawberry: A strawberry flower detection system has been developed using a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB camera. This system captures near-ground images of two strawberry varieties and generates orthoimages, which are then processed using Pix4D software and divided into sequential segments for deep learning detection. A faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) has been employed to detect and count the number of flowers, mature strawberries, and immature strawberries. Additionally, a robotic agriculture system presents a viable solution by training a network on synthetic data and subsequently testing it on real data. This algorithm utilizes a modified version of the Inception-ResNet architecture to effectively capture features across multiple scales, enabling efficient counting even in shadowy conditions. Olive: A study involving 2,800 olive fruits from seven varieties utilized the Inception-ResNetV2 architecture for classification, achieving a top accuracy of 95.91% on external validation sets. This classifier, when integrated into industrial conveyor belts, represents an advanced solution for post-harvest olive processing and classification. The enhanced dataset used in this model distinguishes it from others in the field.
