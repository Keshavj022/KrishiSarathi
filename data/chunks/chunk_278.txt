Disease reaction of ‘DBGC 3’ in sick plots The wilt reaction of the breeding line ‘DBGC 3’ was assessed for five years at Tirhut College of Agriculture, Dholi (under RPCAU, Pusa). The genotype exhibited consistent reaction (resistant to moderately resistant) to Fusarium wilt in wilt-sick plots during 2017-18, 2018-19, 2020-21, 2021-22 and 2022- 23. The reaction of susceptible check (JG 62) was rated highly susceptible, indicating the inoculum load in the wilt-sick plots (Table 3). Besides, it was also tested in AICRP pathological trials for assessing its reaction against other root diseases. It showed moderately resistant reaction to dry root rot (2022-23 and 2021-22) and collar rot (2022-23) at Sabour and Shillongani, respectively (data not presented). Insect pest reaction of ‘DBGC 3’ Gram pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera) is the most damaging insect pest of chickpea. The insect larvae feed on the foliage, flowers and pods of the chickpea plant, sometimes causing severe damages. Though pod borer can be controlled effectively through application of insecticides, incorporation of host plant resistance is considered an eco-friendly approach. Therefore, response of ‘DBGC 3’ towards pod borer was also assessed in AICRP trials. Its reaction (based on larval population and per cent pod damage) to pod borer was comparable to the local check (BG 3043) during 2022- 23. At Dholi, this genotype showed matching performance with the resistant check (ICCL 86111) for per cent pod damage during 2021- 22 and 2022-23. Besides, ‘DBGC 3’ showed yield advantage of over 39 and 12% respectively during 2021- 22 and 2022-23 at Dholi centre when trials were managed under natural condition. Package of practices For realizing maximum yield potential of ‘DBGC 3’, the genotype needs to be grown under timely sown irrigated condition. In the NEPZ, timely sowing starts from the second week of November. Sowing after the 4th week of November drastically reduces the grain yield as the pod-filling stage coincides heat stress. First irrigation should be provided at maximum branching stage (5-6 weeks after sowing).
