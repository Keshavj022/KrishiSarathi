 In coastal saline region of the district, cotton is grown in 10 micro-situations following similar cultural practices irrespective of the micro-farming situations. On the basis of availability of irrigation, land situations (medium and low land), and the extent of soil salinity; 10 micro-situations in 4 villages under two blocks were identified. To augment the productivity of cotton the agronomical practices were reformulated by using higher or lower plant population, fertilizer dose and method of application. The farmers’ practice was use of 80:40:40 (NPK)/ha and planting with 60×45 cm spacing. The results of on-farm trial indicate 17.30 to 92.41% increase in yield in various micro-farming situations.
