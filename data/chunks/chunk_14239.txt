 If global agricultural pro­ duction is to double by 2050 to meet food demands of the population (FAO, 2009), proactive adaptation measures must be implemented to address these impacts. Agriculture being one of the most vulnerable sectors, assessment of vulnerability is a pre-requisite before making informed decisions on adaptation planning and subsequent investments. Prioritizing areas based on their vulnerability will make adaptation an easier task to accomplish. Such assessments will also help governments gain access to multilateral funding institutions for adaptation. Vulnerability assess­ ments are carried out at different scales- global (Adrian et al., 2019; Meza et al., 2019; Veron et al., 2019), regional (Buotte et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2020), or local (Nguyen et al., 2017; Huynh and Stringer, 2018; Chen et al., 2020; Pham et al., 2020); Economic sectors –water resources (Anandhi and Kannan, 2018; Chen et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2020), agriculture (Bouroncle et al., 2017; Wir´ehn et al., 2017; Parker et al., 2019; Kantamaneni et al., 2020), energy (Schaeffer et al., 2012; Handayani et al, 2019; Udie et al., 2018), or tourism (Moreno and Becken, 2009; Hyman, 2014; Dogru et al., 2019); Systems- social (Shah et al., 2013; Huynh and Stringer, 2018; Das et al., 2020), human (Wang and Yarnal, 2012; L´opez-Carr et al., 2014; Mainali and Pricope, 2017) or other biological systems or species (Williams et al., 2008; Summers et al., 2012; Fortini and Schubert, 2017). Such assess­ ments are also indicative of the performance of the system under consideration (Nam et al., 2015). A widely followed approach in vulnerability assessment is the indicator-based approach, which uses single or multiple indicators to represent the three facets of vulnera­ bility- exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (Below et al., 2012). However, the approach is not robust to changes in parameters or weights associated with aggregation (Fernandez et al., 2017). Furthermore, agricultural vulnerability is affected not only by climatic factors but also by other socio-economic factors (Kantamaneni et al., 2020). Local adaptation decisions are still more complex, involving an interplay of technological, social, economic, environmental and behavioral dimensions that cannot be separated from the impact angle. The bottom-up approach in adaptation, in contrast to the top-down approach, is based on the acceptance of irreducible uncertainty about future states (Hall and Murphy, 2011). The key aspect of this approach is that it starts with characterizing the current vulnerability (Bhave et al., 2014). Local-scale adaptations necessitate site-specific knowledge of geographic conditions and water-related risks, which stakeholders can provide (Bhave et al., 2013). This approach begins in the vulnerability domain, with an assessment of society’s vulnerability to current climate variability.
