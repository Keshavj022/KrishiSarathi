 She also adopted drip irrigation technology with the support of the project using her bore well water. It helped her in providing life-saving irrigation because timely irrigation during stress periods and nutrient replenishment through fertigation help in improving the quality of fruits. Drip irrigation has also helped in saving labour charges involved in irrigation, weeding and fertilizer application. She started cultivating tissue culture banana (var. Grand Nain) provided through the project in 0.10 acre fenced land. Soon her backyard farm became the site for other farmersâ€™ field demonstrations under the project in Jamuda village. Since then, she has never looked back. Her backyard vegetable field has been a site for demonstrations of sprinkler irrigation, polythene mulching, crop diversifications, and tapioca and yam tuber crops along the boundary. She has also been producing vermicompost after receiving training and vermibeds from FFP.

Linkages and recognitions Smt Gitanjali has shown keen interest in horticulture- related activities and thus developed good linkages with different public development departments like ICAR-IIWM, Bhubaneswar; KVK, Keonjhar; District Agriculture Office, District Horticulture Office and State Mission Shakti Office. Within 2-3 years, she could learn the skill of growing off-season vegetable cultivation and started disseminating the knowledge and skill to other farmers. Motivated by the successes of Smt Gitanjali Naik, other fellow farmers of the village started cultivating off- season vegetables in their crop fields, and it helped them immensely to improve their livelihood status.
