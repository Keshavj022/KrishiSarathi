Machine’s estimated cost is Rs 70,000 as against Rs120,000 of the imported unit. Its performance has been found at a par with that of the imported unit; commercial, available in the market. Production of this is being taken up in collaboration with a local manufacturer. Sprouted Rice-seeder Refinement A four-row manually-operated rice-seeder has been developed and refined at the CIAE, Bhopal, based on the feedback from the field tests. Its metering mechanism is of gravity drop-type, consisting of 2 seed-containers with diverging ends. On the outer periphery of each container 8 holes of 12 mm diameter are provided. The length of the seed container is 220 mm; the diameter is 220 mm at both ends and 160 mm at the centre. The container is provided with an opening of 60 mm × 60 mm with a cover for filling seeds. The capacity of each container is 2-kg sprouted seeds. The seeder containers (2 no.) are mounted on a shaft connected to 2 lugged wheels. One frame-handle as marker and for pulling is provided. The drive wheels with lugs are made to function as support/transport wheels by providing mild steel round-ring over lugs. The support/drive wheels at both the ends could improve stability during operation compared to single wheel at the centre. The row markers spaced 200 mm apart have provision for changing depth of operation, suiting to height and convenience of the operator.

The effective field capacity of the drum seeder was 0.08 ha/hr and its field efficiency was 85%. Seeding of sprouted rice with the 4-row seeder has been found 70.8% labour-, 87.11% energy-and 83.67% cost-effective compared to mechanized transplanting of seedlings. Tractor-operated Aero-blast Sprayer The sprayer was tested in mango (0.82 ha), sapota (0.14 ha) and jackfruit (0.15 ha) orchards at the CIAE farm. The penetration of the spray into mango-canopy was measured by spraying red-coloured solution on 50 pieces of white card-sheets of 15 cm × 7.5 cm, mounted at the various locations in the canopy.
