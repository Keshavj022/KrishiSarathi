 As a result, when it comes to the WQI, the outstanding class is ranked 1 and the average quality for drinking class is ranked 2 whereas the poor class is ranked 3. The Fig. 8. Sanitary circle wise reported water borne diseases: Pre-monsoon season (left), Post-monsoon season (right). Fig. 9. Ward wise reported water borne diseases: (a) Pre-monsoon season, (b) post-monsoon season. R. Anjum et al. Chemical Engineering Journal Advances 16 (2023) 100547 15 prevalence of WBDs was scored from 3 to 1, with 1 being the least prevalent. It is suggested a lesser vulnerability to waterborne diseases when the water quality was good. By considering that, the susceptibility of waterborne diseases was generated. The evaluation of the outcome with actual ground is a critical task in spatial analysis. Since the number of reported waterborne diseases varies between PRM and POM season, the waterborne diseases suscep­ tibility assessment was carried out on both seasons. Based on the Fig. 10. Circle wise reported water-borne diseases. Fig. 11. Water borne diseases susceptibility map – (a) pre-monsoon season (b) post-monsoon season. R. Anjum et al. Chemical Engineering Journal Advances 16 (2023) 100547 16 waterborne disease’s susceptibility mapping, it was evident that during PRM season (Fig. 11); there has a comparatively high chance of diseases susceptibility than POM season (Fig. 11). During both PRM and POM seasons, the diseases susceptibility was more inclined towards moderate susceptibility zone. PRM season accounted with more areas categorized into low susceptible zone than POM season. 3.7. Water quality assessment for irrigation The quality of irrigation water is critical for ensuring a healthy agricultural production, maintaining soil efficiency, and protecting the environment. Likewise, the source elements of the water have a signif­ icant impact on the irrigation water quality [69].The mineralization of water and its impact on soil and plants are critical factors in determining the appropriateness of groundwater for cultivation. As a result, many agricultural and soil scientists created indices such as SAR [70] and Na% [71] graphs to analyse groundwater suitability for irrigation purposes. Salinity hazard of irrigation water affects the plants which can become the cause of saline soil condition and sodium hazard can turn the soil into Sodic condition. The SAR ranged from 2.217 to 5.109 in the study area. The result shows that SAR hazard for irrigation water is safe (<3.0) for 15.78% of the samples and 84.21% samples fall under slight to moderate (3–9) sodium hazard category. During POM season, the values range from 2.045 to 5.853 respectively where 31.57% lie in safe category and the remaining 68.42% lie in slight to moderate hazard category (Table 5). The percentage of Na+ in the samples ranged from 4.669 to 25.305 in PRM season and from 5.315 to 20.928 in POM season.
