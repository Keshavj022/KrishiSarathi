 Cowdung slurry in semi-solid form was effective in emanating odour compared with the watery state. Red palm weevil, black headed caterpillar and other coconut pests were not attracted due to the above treatments. It can be concluded that the cowdung slurry, dried fish meal powder and castor cake can be explored as components in integrating pest management in coconut ecosystem. â–¡ Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Code Title of the ITK Description of the ITK Name of the discloser Location of use of the ITK Experimenters 370 Sprouting in yam by cowdung slurry Tuberous roots of yam are divided into many pieces, weighing 150 to 200 g dipped in freshly prepared cowdung slurry, dried in shade and kept in sand for sprouting. This results in sprouting within 5-6 days, giving 100% germination. Application of cowdung slurry prevents the entry of micro-organisms, loss of moisture from the cut ends and supply the nitrogen required during initial stages. By this practice the farmers get additional income of Rs 10,000/acre over planting only tops of the tuber. It is being followed by almost all the yam-growing farmers in Benakunda village of Ganjam district in Orissa.

The results obtained through field study and experimental data generated up to 2003 have been reported earlier in Document-3 of the project publication. Continuation of the experiment has resulted in conducting in-depth studies, whose results are presented in this publication. For determining the efficiency the details of the methodologies of the experiments conducted at the Regional Centre of Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, Bhubaneshwar, (Orissa) and farmers' fields are presented here. Sprouting and yield of tubers The experiments were conducted with 3 treatments, viz. (i) ITK method (treatment with fresh cowdung slurry),'(ii) recommended practice (treating with 0.05% Bavistin) and (iii) control (no treatment). Sprouting behaviour was studied at the Research Centre and under on-farm conditions (at Bhanjanagar) with 3 replications and 36 tubers in each replications. Cowdung used Fig. 1.

Treated yam setts spread on the moist sand for sprouting during 2002-03 contained 0.30-0.45% nitrogen, 0.15-0.25% phosphorus, 0.05-0.15% potassium and 14.6% total organic material, and that used during 2003-04 contained 0.62% nitrogen, 0.30% phosphorus, 0.53% potassium and 28.6% total organic material.
