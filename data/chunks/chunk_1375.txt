This variety not only offers a longer-duration green fodder but also produces 26% more green biomass than the local variety (Table 3). This substantial increase in productivity enhances fodder availability, supporting better livestock productivity. Furthermore, farmers adopted perennial grass (BN Hybrid) on their bunds to ensure sufficient green fodder for their livestock. The successful adoption of these improved fodders demonstrates farmers’ willingness to embrace innovation when it aligns with their needs and challenges. CONCLUSION The introduction of improved crop varieties under the Farmer FIRST Programme has had a profound impact on agricultural practices in Jhansi. By equipping farmers with knowledge and access to superior seeds, the program has enhanced agricultural productivity and economic returns. The holistic approach followed under the FFP not only addressed the immediate challenges faced by farmers but also promotes long-term sustainability in agriculture. As more farmers adopt these improved varieties, they are likely to experience increased yields, greater income stability, and improved overall livelihoods, significantly contributing to the region’s economic development. The progress observed in Jhansi underscores the transformative potential of innovation and research in improving the lives of farmers and their communities. The success of the FFP highlights the need to invest in similar programs that provide targeted support in resource-constrained regions. As agricultural challenges grow more complex, initiatives like the FFP serve as a comprehensive strategy to uplift farming communities, improve food systems, and enhance rural livelihoods. Moving forward, it is crucial for policymakers to prioritize integrated approaches that address the specific needs of farmers while fostering sustainable practices, ensuring both the economic well-being of these communities and the overall food security of the country. *Corresponding author email: ffpigfrijhansi@gmail.com Table 3.
