Spray chemical ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 373 pesticides 14 days after Neem Oil Spray for efficient control of insect. Intercultivation should not be done when the tree is in Flowering and Fruiting stage. Irrigation should be done regularly as the Temperatures rises. 2,4-D @ 15 ppm. (1 g per 100 liters) should be sprayed at the time of Flowering, one month after Fruiting and one month before harvesting the fruits.
