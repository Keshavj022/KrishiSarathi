Notable among them is MCU 5 variety belonging to the superior long-staple group released in 1968 in Tamil Nadu which made a breakthrough in improved fiber quality and recorded high seed cotton yields (2.5 t ha-1) combined with wide adaptability. A significant breakthrough in quality cotton was achieved with the release of ‘Sujata’ variety in 1969, capable of being spun to 100s count. ‘Suvin’ (G. barbadense), an extra-long staple (ELS) variety released in 1974, was capable of being spun to 120s count and was considered as one of the best quality cottons in the world (Santhanam and Sundaram 1997). Mega cotton variety ‘LRA 5166’ released in 1982 by ICAR-CICR made a remarkable achievement in large-scale adoption in the south and central zones under both irrigated and rainfed conditions and this became a ruling variety in many cotton-growing states for more than two decades. In recent years, ICAR-CICR released promising varieties with good fibre quality such as ‘Subiksha’ in 2018, ‘Sunantha’ in 2020. Another variety ‘Suraksha’ in 2021, which has a fibre quality of 32 mm length and has wider adaptability for south and central zones.A turning point in the Indian cotton breeding program is the release of the World’s first hybrid (H 4) in 1970 which is of long-staple category with good uniformity and was developed at Surat in Gujarat State (Basu and Paroda 1995). This was followed by the release of the world’s first interspecific ‘Varalaxmi’ hybrid (G. hirsutum x G. barbadense) spinnable to 80s count and was released from Dharwad in Karnataka State. An outstanding achievement was the release of the first desi cotton hybrid G. Cot DH 7 from Surat in 1984. This was followed by another improved desi cotton hybrid DDH 2 from Dharwad. Among the hirsutum varieties developed by ICAR-CICR, ‘Surabhi’ released in 1997 with good fibre length of 32 mm occupied large area in Tamil Nadu. ‘Sumangala’ was released in 2001 with a yield potential of 30q/ha under irrigated conditions. ‘Suraj’ a long staple variety with a high ginning out turn (40%) and high yield potential of 28-30 q ha-1 was released in 2008 and is still the most sought-after variety for organic cotton production in the south and central zone. Among desi cottons, interspecific desi cotton hybrid, G. Cot. DH 9 (G.
