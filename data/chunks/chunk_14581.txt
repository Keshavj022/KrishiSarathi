All regressions use individual fixed effect models. Women who have not participated in agriculture at all across 10 months are excluded from the sample. Standard errors are clustered at the household level. Significance levels: + 0.10, * 0.05, ** 0.01, *** 0.001. 2. The control variables include daily market prices of rice, wheat, onions, potatoes, spinach, tomatoes and pigeon pea, a dummy variable for sickness of children, a dummy for sickness of others in the household, and season dummies and type of day dummies. V. Vemireddy and P.L. Pingali Food Policy 101 (2021) 102074 9 activities. Our analysis shows this distinction very categorically—on average, a woman spends almost the same time as men in agriculture, but men spend limited time in food preparation, domestic work, and care activities. In contrast, women spend more than 300 min daily on cooking and other domestic work-related activities, such as cleaning the house, washing utensils, clothes, etc. In peak seasons of sowing, trans­ planting, and harvesting, we show that women’s extra hours in agri­ culture translate to reduced food preparation time. These findings suggest that women’s engagement in agriculture is high and similar to men’s. Yet, there is no subsequent reduction in the domestic activities for women during peak seasons. Time pressures in agriculture are also associated with less time for sleep, and rest-related activities, impacting women’s overall health. Our findings expand the knowledge on women in agriculture by examining variation in time use and nutrition outcomes across cropping patterns, seasons, and land-ownership. Our results also contribute to the literature by quantifying specific nutrient intakes. After controlling for all the factors, we find that increased time constraints for women across seasons as reflected by the opportunity cost of time translate to reducing their intake of calories, proteins, fats, iron, zinc, and vitamin A. These results hold even after the inclusion of the income of male members of the household, suggesting that time constraints are binding even after controlling for income. We analyze the effects of income-rich households by conducting a sub­ sample analysis using land ownership. We see that time constraints are most binding on women who are landless and almost insignificant when it comes to women who own land. We split the sample by their cropping pattern—cash crops, food crops, and mixed crop households to analyze agriculture pathways.
