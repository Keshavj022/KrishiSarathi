84 ± 0.98 kg at 3-month and 6-month of age, respectively. The average first clip wool yield was 475.51 ± 60.61 g and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) 12.16 ± 0.69%. Animals under intensive feeding management had higher 6-month body weight than animals reared under semi-intensive system, which indicated the exploitation of potentiality of these animals under optimum (ad lib.) feeding system. The tupping per cent was 95.16%, whereas lambing per cent on the basis of ewes available and ewes tupped was 93.00 and 95.60% respectively. Garale × Malpura ewe with triplet BHARAT MERINO At the CSWRI, Avikanagar, genetic improvement process was continued by selection of ram lambs for future breeding on the basis of selection index developed by incorporating first 6-month wool yield and 6-month body weight. The average body weight at birth, 3, 6, 12 month were 3.13,13.12, 22.00 and 31.64 kg respectively. The strain has the potential to be developed as dual-type sheep for fine wool and mutton production. At the elite flock maintained at the SRRC, Mannavanur, mean body weight at birth,3, 6 and 12 month was 4.209,20.69, 25.5 and 38.22 kg respectively. Survivability was 100%, and lambing per cent based on ewes allowed and ewes bred were 82.6 and 88.8% respectively. LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 103 GOAT AICRP on Goat Improvement The goat improvement programme is being carried out with farm and field-based programmes. In farm based programme production performance of Jamunapari, Barbari at the CIRG, Makhdoom, and Sirohi at the CSWRI, Avikanagar, was improved by selection. The major emphasis was to improve milk production and body weight at marketable age of Jamunapari and Barbari goats through use of selected bucks. The bucks were selected on the index basis combining 9/12-month body weight of the buck and 90 days milk yield of their dams. Jamunapari: The production performance of the nucleus flock was improved through selective breeding in the nucleus flock based on selection index. The genetic potential of Jamunapari goat in intensive system of management was 26.9 kg and 34.10 kg at 9 months and 12 months of age, respectively. The body weight gain in intensive system of management was 86.07 ± 4.54 g/day during 6–9 months of age followed by 79.70 ± 3.27 g/day during 9–12 months of age. The milk yield was 68.72 ± 0.95 kg and 95.86 ± 1.39 kg at 90 days and 140 days, respectively. The milk yield was 22.76 and 22.26% higher over the previous year. The average kidding rate in Jamunapari goats was about 1.30. The population growth during the year was about 45.64% and overall mortality 10.42%. Barbari goats: The breed is best known for meat and milk as well as its adaptability over wide range agroclimatic conditions. The kidding rate of Barbari goat was about 1.5, indicative of high reproductive potential of the breed. The present milk yield at 140 days was 93.79 litres.
