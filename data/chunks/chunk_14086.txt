To assess irrigation water quality on 94 open wells and bore wells, groundwater samples have been taken from the drought-prone Arjunanadi River basin, South India. The samples have been analysed chemically for EC, TDS, pH, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO4 2−, Cl−, NO3 −, HCO3 −and F−. The groundwater samples are slightly alkaline (7.12 to 8.28) as per pH. Similarly, higher EC indicates high level of dissolved salts in groundwater samples. EC, TDS, SAR, Na%, RSC, KR, MHR and PI are called as irrigation water quality parameters which are to be evaluated. The SAR is almost at a safe level for irrigation purposes, and as per USSL diagram, high salinity and low alkalinity are found in 77 % of groundwater samples. About 50 % of the primary groundwater samples in the Wilcox diagram fall inside the permissible domain. On the basis of Doneen’s classification, good permeability domain has 64 % of groundwater samples.
