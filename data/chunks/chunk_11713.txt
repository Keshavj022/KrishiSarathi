23(71)/2016-Cdn(Tech) vi Recommendation:   There is a need to prepare computer simulation models of different weather probabilities and develop and promote farming system approaches which can help to minimize the adverse impact of unfavorable weather, while maximizing the benefits of a good monsoon.   To monitor changes in pest and disease profiles and predict new pest and disease outbreaks, an early warning system should be put in place. The overall pest control strategy should be based on Integrated Pest Management for controlling the multiple pests in a given climatic scenario.   Public awareness and capacity building of stakeholders on climate change will aid in effective implementation of the policies and respond effectively to the threats or opportunities posed by climate change.
