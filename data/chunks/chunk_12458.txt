 • Mushroom-Integration with farming systems (crop – livestock system) under low and mid-hill regions.   Promotion of improved pasture and grassland management, agroforestry, and cultivation of sweet stalk sorghum, maize and pearl millet to increase milk production through cooperative societies.   Promotion of integrated farming comprising of crossbred, exotic or Indigenous milch breeds of dairy cattle/Yak, fisheries, sheep, goats, backyard poultry, pig, emu and rabbits. Use of advanced fingerlings of fish for increasing productivity in fisheries.   Promotion of Cluster approach/Contract farming for efficient crop management, and linking production centers with markets and value addition through processing. Market Interventions   Reduction of post-harvest and in-transit losses by developing a chain of cold stores, reefer trucks in strategic alliance with agribusiness cooperatives.Strengthening of main and link roads, timely availability of transport vehicles, market intelligence, cold storages, warehouses, processing units, and promotion of grower societies (Co-operative marketing), and auction yardsto increase net profits. State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 206   Post-harvest technology for value addition, value added products of ginger, mango, citrus, ginger, garlic and vegetables, extraction of pectins, kernel oil of apricot, and value added/dried products of apple, plum, pear, apricot, fig and vegetables. Institutional Support   Land fragmentationhas resulted in disruption of economies of scale, and hence, it should be mandatory to define the minimum size of holdings that areeconomically viable.   Cultivation of arable lands should be made mandatory, and the stray cattle and wild animals be controlled through policy/ legislation.   Promote public - private partnership.   Define quality standards for crop produce and link it to prices.   Minimum support price and buy back mechanisms to reduce on-farm losses.   Promotion of e-trading,both for the agricultural inputs and the crop produce.   Reform Import/Export policiesto promote farming.   Provision of loans at differential rates of interest for different categories of farmers (linked to size of land holdings).   Farm mechanization support for reducing labor input costs.   Bringing majority of the farmers under Crop Insurance Schemes to mitigate risks of crop failures. Only 4.4% farmers have been brought under Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) in apple crop only.   Allotment of “Nautaur land” out of the ceiling-surplus, and wastelands specially in the tribal areas, to increase the size of land holding to small farmers.   Implementation of Prof MSSwaminathanCommittee Report for 50% profit pricing of agricultural produce to the farmers.   Development of farmers’ produce organizations (FPO’s)for leveraging institutional support and facilitating direct farmer-consumer linkage to vanish the role of middle/ business man.
