 In addition, supported by the National Health Mission, PLA groups have been scaled up across all districts in Jharkhand and one-third of districts in the Madhya Pradesh states, through incentivized ASHAs and ASHA supervisors (56, 57). Evidence on statewide scaleups of PLA groups in Jharkhand showed that employing incentivized ASHAs and ASHA supervisors and using an innovative 2264 Haghparast-Bidgoli et al.

Similar models could be tested for participatory video–based NSA interventions. Although there is clearly policy interest in the UPAVAN components, their implementation at scale is currently only being conducted by government frontline workers from single sectors. Scaleup of the UPAVAN interventions and other multisectoral approaches will require coordination of multiple stakeholders across sectors, for which the challenges are well recognized (12). It is hoped that our economic evaluation will provide further impetus to increase collaboration across sectors, but stakeholder analyses may be needed to further support this goal. Limitations Some limitations of this study are notable. First, adoption of practices promoted by the UPAVAN interventions, or collective actions taken by participating communities, might have caused direct and indirect costs and benefits to participants and the communities that were not accounted for. As with any complex economic evaluation, it is difficult to determine the direction of bias in our overall conclusions because it was also not possible to fully identify and measure all of the benefits associated with the interventions.
