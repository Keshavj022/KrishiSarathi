 Outcome in Column (9) is the total number of labor-days per cultivated acre. The regressions in Columns (3) and (9) are conditional on households that are cultivating some land in both periods. The 𝑝-value from a F-test of the joint significance of the two coefficients is reported at the bottom of the panel. Observations are weighted using 1999 sample weights. Standard errors, clustered at the village level, are reported in parentheses. *𝑝< 0.10, **𝑝< 0.05, ***𝑝< 0.01. Consistent with the findings in Section 6.3, I find no detectable impact on the index for staple crop cultivation (column 1) and large positive impacts across the other three indices (columns 2 through 4). Alternate specifications of proxy for access to non-agriculture. Through- out my analysis, I use a binary indicator for villages within 10 kilo- meters of the nearest town at baseline to proxy for access to non- agriculture. I test the sensitivity of my results to two alternate spec- ifications of this proxy in Appendix Table B14 – 5 (columns 1 and 2) and 15 kilometers (columns 3 and 4) – and I find that the results are largely consistent. Among directly treated households in villages within 5 kilometers of the closest town, I find a significant decline in households’ engagement in cultivation (F-test 𝑝-value of 0.013), accom- panied by an increase in person-days worked in the casual labor market for non-agriculture (F-test 𝑝-value of 0.003). These effects are larger in magnitude than the effects I find with the 10 kilometer cutoff in Table 3, lending further support to the argument that non-agricultural opportunities are spatially concentrated close to towns. When I move to the 15 kilometer cutoff, the impacts are less precisely estimated but the sign of the coefficients point in the right direction. In Appendix Table B15, I estimate the pooled treatment effects of improvements in rural road infrastructure on households’ crop choices and farm input decisions using a 5 (panel A) and 15 kilometer (panel B) cutoff; I find that the results are largely consistent with my findings in Tables 4 and 5. Sample selection. In constructing my balanced panel, I restrict my sample to households that appeared in both waves of the REDS and aggregate partitioned households back to the 1999 household unit level. In Appendix Table B16, I test for differential attrition and split- ting of households across treatment and control villages. None of the coefficients are significant at standard levels, which suggests that there was no differential attrition or splitting of households as a result of the road-building program. Finally, in Appendix Table B17, I show that my results are robust to excluding all households that split over time. 7.
