   Increasing profitability using seasonal ponds: The seasonal ponds which retain water for 5-6 months can be utilized for addition fish production using medium carp which was assessed by the KVK North Tripura using Cirrhinus reba, popularly known as Lachu. The average growth in lachu was 83g/6 months and its contribution in composite culture was 237.5 kg in total fish yield of 1725 kg/ha. They also 568 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 demonstrated polyculture of prawn with IMCs with a production of 13 kg prawn and 3360 kg carps /ha. (Technology assessed/refined/both- KVK, North Tripura)   Popularization of Integrated fish farming to reduce cost of production, enhance nutritional security and provide employment opportunity to rural people. Integration of livestock with aquaculture enhances productivity of fish ponds, generate additional revenue and employment for the fisher’s family in one hand, and it reduces the cost of feed and fertilizer on the other. In general, either of 5-6 cattle, 30-40 pigs, 400-500 ducks or 500600 poultry is sufficient to fertilize one ha of pond size in Tripura. At ICAR Tripura Centre, in comparison to normal yield of 2.65 t fish/ha, the annual fish production was increased to 2.65-3.20 t/ha in Agri-horti fish culture, 3.47-4.12 t/ha in duck-fish and 4.44.5 t/ha in pig-fish and 4.25-5.12 t/ha in fish-pig-tuber crops systems (Santhosh et al., 2011). Similarly, multiple stocking and multiple harvesting in duck- fish system over 0.2 ha land annually produced 606 kg fish and 1230 eggs with a BC ratio of 3.42 at farmer’s field   in Bagma (South Tripura). Likewise, duck-fish system at KVK-North Tripura annually produced 3.2 t fish, 35 kg duck meat and 1200 eggs from one ha land (Technology assessed at KVK-North Tripura).   Stocking of advance fingerlings in reservoirs and rivers has to be adopted as a continuous process to avoid depletion of catch to supplement of the stocking. Freshwater prawn culture should be popularized among the fish farmers.   Producing more fish through pond based cage culture: There is scope of cage culture in the ponds of Tripura which is 1.90 Lakh. Low-cost cages can be fabricated using bamboo, woods etc and installed into the ponds for additional fish production. Carnivorous/ predatory fishes can be cultured with carps in the same ponds using cages. Beside, cages are easy to operate and maintain even by the women farmers. ICAR Tripura Centre has demonstrated a production of 6.3 kg fish /m3 in Java puti (Puntius sophore) and 6.5 kg/m3 in red tilapia using bamboo-made cages [(Agrinews 2011 9(3): 6]   Reducing the feed cost: Rice bran, mustard oil cake and meat meal are the three major ingredients of balanced fish feed. In Tripura rice is cultivated in 2.57 lakh ha area over all the three seasons, and thus rice husk/bran is sufficiently available.
