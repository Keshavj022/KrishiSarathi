 Even though the GPR models were trained with non-vegetation spectra added to the training with trait values set to zero, they were finally applied to a soil-masked pre- processed UAV image. Notably, no zero or close-to-zero values were obtained in the final estimated maps, which indicates the absence of non-vegetated regions, proving the advantage of including them during model training.

Mean estimates and coefficient of variation (CV) of (a1,a2) LAI and (b1,b2) CCC. Part B 3. Architectural considerations a. Data management The experimental plots were overflown by a Headwall Nano-Hyperspec hyperspectral camera (Headwall Photonics Inc., Bolton, MA, USA) mounted on a UAV hexacopter on 17 March 2022. The hyperspectral image composed of 269 bands in the range of 400–1000 nm with a spectral interval of 2.2 nm and spatial resolution of 4 cm was captured at a flight height of 21 m. ● Image distance: A 21m distance between the camera on mounted drone and the crop was maintained. Images were captured from a top-view of the crop. ● Image quality: The image quality was very high for retrieval of the crop health traits accurately. ● Image consistency: The images were taken consistently across the entire crop area, ensuring that the images are representative of the whole crop and not just certain areas. ● Camera settings: Camera settings, such as aperture, and shutter speed, were optimized to capture high-quality images in different lighting conditions. ● Crop variability: The wheat field consisted of three replications of fifteen plots (7.2 × 13 m size each), maintained at five graded nitrogen levels (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha−1), and three irrigation treatments (soil moisture sensor-based treatment (I1); crop water stress index (CWSI)-based treatment (I2); and conventional treatment (I3)).
