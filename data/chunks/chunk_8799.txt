 Germplasm Conservation In this year, 7,946 accessions have been added to in the long-term conservation in the National Gene Bank, resulting in 204,740 accessions in toto. A total of 642 released varieties have been transferred to long-term storage. Over 1,300 accessions of barley, jute, mustard, sesame and ocimum monitored for seed viability have been ● ●● ●● Total 15,876 samples of diverse crops from 40 countries and 50,230 samples of international trials from the IRRI, CIMMYT and ICARDA have been introduced. ● For consignments meant for export, 178 phytosanitary certificates have been issued. ● Molecular profiles of 79 non-aromatic rice cultivars have been obtained using 48 mapped sequence tagged microsatellite loci. ● A database for storage and for retrieval of DNA fingerprint information is being developed. ● NRC on plant biotechnology has been identified as one of the centres to participate in a global endeavour to sequence rice genome. ● A novel vegetative insecticidal protein vip 3A gene has been isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis and characterized at the molecular level.

Accessions of sorghum (11,112), chickpea (209) and groundnut (341) have been restored from the ICRISAT and 3,876 accessions belonging to over 400 taxa are being maintained in the cryo-bank, which includes 907 accessions of orthodox and intermediate seed species, added this year. Forty-seven accessions have been augmented in in-vitro repository, resulting in 1,178 accessions in total.
