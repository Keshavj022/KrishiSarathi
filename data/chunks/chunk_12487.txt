 Lime application needs to be popularized along with recommended dose offertilizers.   Area under SRI needs to be increased from 0.75 lakh ha to 1.5 lakh ha through awareness& capacity building of farmers for increased productivity. 2. Western Plateau Sub Zone V (Medium Upland (Don- III) - 7 districts (9.30 lakh ha) Medium upland consisting of 2.0 lakh ha is very much vulnerable and transplanted rice and needs to be diversified with coarse cereals and pulses as rice cultivation is not remunerative because of higher incidence of pests and diseases (Pod borer, Wilt).   Diversification of rice cropping system with Maize, Pigeon-pea, Sorghum and Pearl Millet is required by promoting cultivation of Maize, Pigeon-pea, Sorghum and Pearl Millet in cropping system. Present area under diversified cropping system needs to be increased from 10, 000 ha to 2.0 lakh ha.   Sowing of identified crops in ridge and furrow method is recommended by capacity building of farmers as they still practice traditional system   Early maturing and high yielding HYVs/hybrids through introduction of early maturing and high yielding HYVs/hybrids like Sorghum (CSV-20), Pigeon-pea (Birsa Arhar- 1),Maize (HQPM-1), Pearl millet (JB-3)   Popularization of recommended INM and IPM modules (25 % RDF through organic and75% chemical fertilizers 3. South Eastern Plateau Sub Zone VI (Upland (Tanr) -3 districts (3.20 lakh ha) Upland consisting of 1.0 lakh ha is acidic in nature, therefore, productivity is low. Rice cultivation in upland is less remunerative because of poor management of uplands Diversification of Upland rice with Ragi, Blackgram, Soyabean, etc. in cropping system Ensuring availability of quality seeds Beej Gram (from 1053 to 4500 Beej Grams) Introduction of need based and location specific varieties of Ragi (Birsa Marua-2), Blackgram (Birsa Urid-1), Soyabean (Birsa Safed Soyabean-2) Horticulture – Vegetables Vegetables accounts for 14.01% of net area sown in the state. Major constraints encountered are: i. Less availability of suitable quality seed, ii. Imbalanced use of fertiliser for hybrids& poor irrigation facilities and iii. High incidence of pests (Borers) & diseases (Bacterial wilt) Steps to be taken: 242 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022   Bringing additional 20 % area under HYV/Hybrid vegetable cultivation. Production of800t of quality seed, 200 t of Foundation seed and 75 t breeder seed through Public Private Partnership (PPP)   Application of RDF followed by INM with drip irrigation by capacity building of farmers   Promotion of cultivation of rainy season tomato by targeting existing 36431 ha area ofTomato under traditional system (23.4 t/ha) by replacing with SwarnaLalima (50-60t/ ha), Swarna Sampada F1(70-80 t/ha)   Promotion of cultivation of rainy season Brinjal by targeting existing 23140 ha area of Brinjal under traditional cultivation (22.
