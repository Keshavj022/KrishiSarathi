 Three potentiality classes namely, highly potential, moderately potential, and marginally potential are suggested. The Telangana is divided into three agroclimatic zones, viz. Northern Telangana Zone (NTZ), Central Telangana Zone (CTZ), and Southern Telangana Zone (STZ). The rice crop had a greater area (11,05,000 ha) in the highly potential class followed by maize (5,55,000 ha) in CTZ. In NTZ, rice (13,96,000 ha) was followed by wheat (9,08,000 ha) and maize (7,16,000 ha), whereas, the maximum area under the highly potential category for Italian millet (kora), Proposed alternate land-use plan for Bundelkhand Maharashtra (PoCRA Districts) Gujarat (Bharuch and Surat districts) Madhya Pradesh (Datia and Morena) Reflectance spectra of analyzed soil samples icar annual report 2022-23 120 Groundwater quality map of Madhya Pradesh for irrigation sorghum, rice, finger millet (ragi), and pearl millet (bajra) were observed in the STZ. The evaluation of potential area for rice showed that about 61.42 lakh ha area is potential area for rice in Telangana. Highly potential areas occupied 32.91 lakh ha with moderately potential area of 28.52 lakh ha. In Central Telangana Zone (CTZ), it was observed that 11.05 and 9.31 lakh ha of area is highly and moderately potential area, respectively. Northern Telangana Zone (NTZ) had 13.96 lakh ha of highly potential area and 6.34 lakh ha of moderately potential area. Whereas, in Southern Telangana Zone (STZ), 7.89 and 12.86 lakh ha highly and moderately potential areas, respectively were noticed. Predictive models developed for soil properties with spectral data Potential area for Rice Soil and Water Productivity The potential cropping systems (dominant) identified for Telangana were rice/castor/cotton/chilli (11,16,000 ha) > castor (7,82,000 ha) > cotton + chilli; cotton/chilli (5,28,000 ha) etc. which contribute around 12.2, 8.5 and 5.7%, respectively to the total cultivable area of 9,175 ha. Ground water quality map of Madhya Pradesh: Groundwater quality map for irrigation purpose for Madhya Pradesh was prepared using data of 6,483 groundwater samples under GIS (ArcMap GIS software 9.3.1). The groundwater samples were classified into different saline and alkali categories based on pH, EC and SAR. In whole Madhya Pradesh, 87.3% samples were of good (A) quality and 7.7 and 5.0% were saline (B) and alkali (C) categories, respectively. Out of 11 agro climatic zones of Madhya Pradesh, seven had the good quality water in more than 90% water samples. The Chhattisgarh Plains, Northern Hills Zone of Chhattisgarh, Central Narmada Valley, Satpura Plateau and Jhabua Hills agro climatic zones had good quality water in more than 95% samples. The groundwater samples of gird zone and Bundelkhand zone had poor quality water in respect icar annual report 2022-23 121 of alkali water category and represented 20.5% and 12.2% samples. On the other hand, in Malwa Plateau, 12.0 and 2.
