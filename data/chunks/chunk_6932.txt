Research for Tribal and Hill Regions North West Himalayas Breeder seed production: During the period under report, 16,138 tonnes breeder seed of 46 released varieties/inbreds of 17 crops were produced. A total of 13.121 tonnes breeder seeds were supplied to different seed producing agencies to further multiplication. Quality seed production: Around 1,313 kg nucleus seed of 49 released varieties of 17 crops were also produced following standard methods of maintaining genetic purity. In addition to this, 655 kg Truthfully Labeled seed of 20 varieties of 13 crops were produced. Including the carry-over stock of TL seed; a total of around 402 kg TL seeds were supplied to different stakeholders. Crop varieties released and notified Variety Area of adoption Salient features VLQPM Hybrid 45 North Western Hill Zone (Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand Hills) and North Eastern Hill Region (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura) Early maturing (90-95 days); at par yield (6,673 kg/ha) with the original normal corn hybrid VMH 45. Possesses mean tryptophan, lysine and protein of 0.66%, 2.90% and 8.72%, respectively. Moderate resistance against turcicum-leaf blight. VL Dhan 69 Uttarakhand, Sikkim and J&K Short bold grain, plant height of 95-105 cm, 125-130 days maturity and high panicles/m2 (282). Average grain yield 4,255 kg/ha in medium hills (18.22% superiority over the best check VL Dhan 6). Unique decorticated grain colour (reddish brown). 79.9% hulling, 69.1% milling, 55.4% head rice recovery, intermediate ASV (5.0) and amylose content of 26.78%.

VL Dhan 69 Mature cobs of VLPQM Hybrid 45 CROP MANAGEMENT Crop Production Finger millet variety VL Mandua 379 was evaluated to four different nitrogen levels with three different split applications of urea under rainfed conditions. Among various nitrogen levels 60 kg N/ha recorded the maximum grain yield (3,332 kg/ha) which was at par with 80 kg N/ha (3,200 kg/ ha). The highest grain yield was recorded with three different splits (3,306 kg/ ha).
