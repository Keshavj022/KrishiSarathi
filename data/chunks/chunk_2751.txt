 The plants were identified based on PCR test, by using Mon 531 specific primers. The plants which did not show presence of Mon 531 were tested with primers designed for Cry 1 Ac. The plants negative for Mon 531 and positive for Cry lAc specific were identified. 34 - 43. Details of number of seeds/plants tested, their generation, and the results of the tests, i.e., how many plant were +ve for both MON 531 and BN Bt, +ve for MON 531 and -ve for BN Bt, -ve for MON 531 and +ve for BN Bt, and -ve for both?

It was not theT3 plants used for purifICation but for purification, Ts generation field grown plants and Ts generation old seed material were used. 45. How many TJ plants with multicopies were raised during 2oo9? What was the segregation pattern for MON 531 and BNLA 601? Progenies of five multiple Bt plants of 2007 produce was screened by raising in 2010. Since germination was poor, segregation pattern was not noted; however Mon 531 negetive but with cry lAc positive plants were identified. 46. Did Mabyco-Monsanto approach UAS, Dharwad or CICR, Nagpur to complain about the presence ofMON 531? Mahyco - Monsanto did not approach or complain UAS, Dharwad about the presence ofMon - 531. 35 47. Who prepared the application for submission to RCGM and GEAC? Applications to RCGM and GEAC were prepared by CICR, Nagpur. 48. Why the application was submitted to RCGM and GEAC without carrying out all the required tests and purification of BN Bt? At tbe time of making applications for RCGMlGEAC, the problem of contamination was not known. 49. Was th'e gene construct used to develop BN Bt was developed by NRCPB, New Delhi or obtained from some other source? Gene construct was supplied by NRCPB, IARI, New Delhi. 50. We understand that the construct was obtained from Prof. IIIimar Altosaar.
