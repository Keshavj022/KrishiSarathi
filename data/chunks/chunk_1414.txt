For tasks such as spraying pesticides and applying fertilizers, he did not hire labour; instead, he personally conducted these operations with the assistance of his wife. Additionally, he involved his family members in harvesting the flowers, working alongside hired labour, which helped him save approximately 2 to 3 hired labour costs with each harvesting cycle. The introduction of the drip irrigation system made it easier to irrigate the crops, and he occasionally utilized the system for fertigation during sole fertilizer applications. Moreover, in addition to manual weeding, he employed a dry land weeder to reduce the overall intensity of weeding operations, allowing for more efficient management of weeds. This combination of strategies not only minimised costs but also enhanced the efficiency of his farming practices. On average, harvesting occurred once a week, resulting in approximately four harvests per month. With each harvest the flower yield weighed between 35-40 Kg, which was manageable quantity for him to carry to market. He personally transported the flowers to the Gudimalkapur market, at 80 km distance from the village either by bus or by bike, which helped him reduce transportation costs significantly. He sold his flowers for ` 200 to 1,500, taking advantage of strong demand during weddings and festival seasons. Throughout the year, he successfully marketed approximately 1,800 Kg of flowers, with an average price of ` 300/Kg.
