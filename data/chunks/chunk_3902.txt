Almost same pattern was observed in B:C ratio which was 3.13 in the demonstrations and 2.23 on farmers’ field. The impact of demonstrations indicated that performance of Indra hybrid of capsicum has been outstanding in respect of production and quality as compared to California wonder grown by the farmers. The present average productivity in hills of Uttarakhand metric tonnes/ha while the average productivity of capsicum on the farmers’ field was 7.75 metric tonnes/ ha. July–August 2023 23 is 5.07 metric tonnes/ha while in the field demonstrations it was 13.50 metric tonnes/ha. Thus, 8.43 metric tonnes/ ha of additional average productivity recorded in the demonstrations which was 166.27% higher as compared to average productivity in mountain region of Uttarakhand. The additional income received due to increase in average productivity was ` 3,37,200.00/ha. At present, capsicum is cultivated in an area of 2456.19 ha in 11 hilly districts of Uttarakhand. Thus, total additional income of about ` 82.82 crores may be obtained, if farmers adopt the demonstrated integrated crop management technology on their fields. It is clear from the demonstrations that integrated adoption of crop management technology gave tremendous impact on production and profitability of capsicum as an off-season crop.
