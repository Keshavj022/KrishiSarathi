 Algorithms analyze these data such as moisture content, pH levels, and nutrient composition to detect early signs of nutrient deficiencies, pest infestations, or diseases. Image recognition algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are particularly effective in analysing images from drones or smartphones to detect anomalies in crops. Additionally, models that use weather and environmental data can predict the likelihood of pest outbreaks, enabling farmers to take preventive measures before significant damage occurs. By training these models on large data sets, farmers can receive recommendations on which crops are best suited for their land, how to optimise fertilisation, and when to irrigate, even in the absence of irrigation infrastructure. This information allows for timely interventions to maintain crop health Yield prediction: These models use a combination of remote sensing data, weather forecasts, past yield data, and even socio-economic factors to predict yields with high accuracy. This allows farmers and agribusinesses to plan better, manage resources, and minimise risks associated with poor yields. By running different scenarios through these models, farmers can predict the impact of variables like unexpected droughts or flooding, which aids in strategic planning and insurance claims. Supply chain optimization: It can also analyse market trends, demand forecasts, and logistical data to streamline the transport of crops. This minimises delays and reduces costs by suggesting the most efficient routes and storage practices to keep products fresh. It assists in tracking produce from the farm to the consumer, ensuring transparency and food safety. This builds trust with consumers and helps in recalling batches in case of contamination. Climate change adaptation: AI&ML-powered advanced models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, can analyse patterns in rainfall, temperature, and humidity to predict future weather over days, weeks, or even seasonal conditions and provides more accurate and longer-term predictions. Farmers can use this information to adjust planting schedules, protect crops from predicted severe weather, and plan harvests to avoid damage from unexpected storms. Advisory services and decision support systems: AI&ML driven platforms and mobile apps can turn data into actionable intelligence and provide farmers with personalised advice on when to plant, what crop varieties to choose, and how to manage pests and diseases through Decision support systems (DSS). These systems consider real-time data inputs such as local weather forecasts, soil health, and crop growth stages to give tailored advice on planting, fertilisation, and pest control. Drones in rainfed agriculture Drones have become a valuable machine in rainfed agriculture, providing farmers with new capabilities to monitor, manage, and optimise their practices.
