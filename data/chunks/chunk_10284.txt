 Selective breeding approach was undertaken to improve the performance of indigenous breeds in their home tract. This is being practiced at CIRG, Makhdoom for increasing the milk production in Jamunapari (63%) and Barbari goats (85.4%) since 1985. Selection for growth is continuing in Barbari and Jamunapari goats at CIRG, Makhdoom since 1985. Feedlot kids attained 33.75±1.01 kg and 41.85±0.81 kg at 9 and 12 months of age, respectively. In Jamunapari goats there was increase in body weight at 12 months from 20.32 kg to 29.60 kg indicating an improvement of 45.67%. In Barbari goats an increase in body weights from 18.52 kg to 24.44 kg at 12 months with improvement of 31.96% over the years, was observed. The Pashmina yield varies from 78 g in first clip to 227 g Indian Agriculture after Independence 146 in the third clip. Chegu and Changthangi goats showed an annual Pashmina production of 132 g and 214 g, respectively, with an average fiber diameter of 12.4 micron. Selection based on greasy fiber weight and fiber diameter combined into an index is likely to provide maximum genetic progress in improving Pashmina production. The genetic trends obtained for weight at all ages were positive in Jamunapari goat (0.144 kg/year at 9 months of age and 0.199 kg/year at 12 months of age) (Rout et al. 2018). The genetic trend for birth weight was positive but almost constant in nature. There was an increase in mean milk yield of 0.25 kg/year, 0.70 kg/year and 0.72 kg/year at 90 days, 140 days and total milk yield, respectively, in Jamunapari goats (Rout et al. 2017). Barbari Female Jamunapari Male 4.5. Pig Out of 9.06 million of pigs in the country (Livestock Census, 2019), a larger proportion (78%) is indigenous and non-descript. They are smaller in size, well adapted to hot and humid climate and comparatively have better disease resistance. An AICRP on pig was started during IV Five Year Plan (1970-1971), initially with four Centres that increased to 16 centres covering 7 indigenous pig breeds. Recently, 6 centres of the Megaseed project were also included in the AICRP. At present, there are ten registered pig breeds in the country (Ghungroo, Niang Megha, Agonda Goan, Tenyi Vo, Nicobari, Doom, Zovawk, Gurrah, Mali and Purnia). Presently, conservation of these indigenous breeds is being done at the institute and AICRP centers by collecting superior, true-to-the-breed animals from their breeding tract and further propagating through selective breeding. Litter size at birth and weaning showed continuous improvement over the years. Growth rates and body weights at 32-weeks were also increased significantly. Litter size at weaning and weight at 8-months also showed an overall genetic gain of 7% to 15% in different indigenous breeds. However, genetic improvement of indigenous breeds through pure breed selection has been slow. Achievements in Livestock and Poultry Production in Independent India 147 4.6.
