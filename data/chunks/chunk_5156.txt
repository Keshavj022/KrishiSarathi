(1996) also recommended that in animals exhibiting no signs of systemic illness may recover spontaneously without any treatment. Experiment Efficacy: The efficacy of different treatments has been presented in Table 4. Fig. 7. Group a: The animals (n=6) with retained placenta were presented in clinics within 6-24 hrs post retention (18-36 hrs after calving). These animals were administered 500 grams of chopped banana Inflorescence. Though two animals (33.3%) responded to the treatment, but the time taken for expulsion of placenta was around one hr. post treatment. Group b: The animals (n=6) having placental Fig. 6. Comparative popularity of various treatments for retained placenta under field conditions Most of the farmers (51.12%) resorted to Allopathic treatment.

Since all the animals failed to expel the placenta they were treated successfully using conventional therapy. None of the animals expelled their placenta within the specified period (20-30 minutes after treatment) as claimed by the discloser. Only two animals expelled their placenta within 1 hr after feeding banana inflorescence. Palatability The proposed ITK treatments (banana inflorescence and baykhal twig extract) were conveniently accepted by the animals specially when supplemented with molasses or jaggery. Adverse effects The animals were observed for 4 hr after treatment. No clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis, diarrhoea, tympany, hyper salivation and Fig. 7. Comparative efficacy of different treatments retention for 24-48 hrs post calving were administered 200 ml of Baykhal twigs extract and observed for one hr. post treatment. None of the animals responded to the treatment. Group c: The animals (n=6) were reported for retention of placenta following normal calving. They were observed for expulsion of placenta for Table 4.

CONCLUSION Based on results of QUIK method, the ITK under investigation is not being commonly practised under field conditions for easy expulsion of retained placenta.
