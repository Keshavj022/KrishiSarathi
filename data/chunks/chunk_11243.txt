 yy First weeding should be done after 15-20 days of sowing and second weeding should be done after 30-35 days. Thinning (weeding) of the plants during weeding and maintain plant distance for about 10 to 12 cm. Use 1.25 litters per hectare Elachlor 50 E.C. for weed control. yy Irrigation is required when the plant has 50-60% pods but has a lack of moisture. Sugarcane Early maturing Variety: CoLK-9700, Co-0237, Co-0229, Co-05009, CoPK-05191, CoS-03251, Co- 588230, CoSa-98231, Co-0238, CoS- 8436 Mid late Maturity Varieties â€“ CoS-567, CoS-8432, CoS- 97264, CoS- 96275, CoSa-01434, UP- 0097, CoS-94257, CoS-96269, CoPant-84212, CoS-07250, CoS-20193, CoPant-97222 Field Preparation: 14 to 18 % Soil Moisture is best for obtaining good germination Planting time: For best Germination of sugarcane 26-32 0C temperature is best Suited. 83 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS For Autumn planted cane is 15 September to October and spring season, 15 February to March is the best time in Western Uttar Pradesh and central region. For late-planted cane it can be planted from April to mid-May. Nutrient management: yy Application of well decomposed FYM/compost @ 10-15 t/ha or composted press mud @ 5 t/ha is recommended yy An average crop of sugarcane yielding 100 t/ha removes 208 kg of N, 53kg of P, 280 kg of K, 30 kg of Sulphur, 3.4kg of iron, 1.2 kg of manganese and 0.6 kg of copper from the soil. yy In Uttar Pradesh, the N requirement of sugarcane is about 150-180 kg N/ha, , apply 60-80 kg P2 O5 and 60 kg K2O/ha Weed management: yy Three hoeing, at 1, 4, and 7 weeks after ratoon initiation should be adopted for effective control of weeds in sugarcane ratoon crop. However, under limitations of manpower-availability, cost etc., pre-emergence application of either of atrazine @ 2.0 kg a.i./ha or metribuzin @ 1.0 kg a.i./ha (800- 1000 litres water/ha) followed by either of 2,4-D Na salt @ 1.0 kg/ ha ai (in 600-800 litres water/ha) or hoeing at 45 days after ratooning can be successfully practiced. Further, trash mulching in alternate rows and hoeing in unmulched furrow at 1 & 6 weeks after ratoon initiation is also a good option yy Management of binding weeds: application of atrazine @ 2 kg ai/ ha or metribuzine @ 1.25 kg ai/ha as pre-emergence followed by DICAMBA @ 350 g ai/ha at 75 DAP is effective for controlling binding weeds in sugarcane Tying and wrapping: yy These operations are most essential in sugarcane cultivation just to provide mechanical support to the grown-up plants to prevent lodging. The leaves are removed from the plants and wrapped together by taking all canes in one bundle. By wrapping the 84 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS distribution of CO becomes easy and proper throughout the 2 eld. After wrapping, the clumps in, adjacent rows are tied together (cross-wise). Tying should be done in the month of August when cane reaches about 2 m height.
