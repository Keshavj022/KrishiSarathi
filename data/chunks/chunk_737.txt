 Soil Health Card Scheme, Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), Rainfed Area Development and Climate Change, National Project on Agro-Forestry, National Mission on Horticulture, National Project on Organic Farming, Micro Irrigation Fund scheme, ant National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) schemes of Government of India have got considerable significance to carbon mitigation from agriculture. As a result of these actions, for the first time GHG emission from Indian agriculture reduced by 2.25% during 2016 compared to 2014 level. Carbon emission mitigation and carbon sequestration due to various actions taken in agriculture during the 2017–18 and 2018–19 is given in the Table 3. Table 3.

(a) (b) Experimental view of zero-tillage wheat with rice residue retention under various irrigation system at ICAR-CSSRI, Karnal, Haryana Conservation agriculture practice: Zero tillage wheat with rice residue retention in (a) sprinkler irrigation, and (b) drip irrigation Indian Farming 52 June 2023 The current emission from the crop sector is about 150 Mt CO2 eq./yr. Our experiences show that alternate wetting and drying in rice with short-duration variety, neem-coated urea with soil health card and leaf colour chart reduces GHG emission from rice by 40-50%. If we go for dry direct-seeded rice (DSR) without continuous submergence, the emission is reduced by about 70%. Crop diversification from rice-wheat to maize-wheat can reduce global warming potential (GWP) by 70–80%. Conservation agriculture including no or minimum tillage, residue retention and direct seeding of rice can reduce GHG emission by 30-40%. If we combine drip or sprinkler irrigation, run with solar or any form of renewable energy the emission is almost zero. Our study showed that with current adoption of conservation agriculture and DSR, mitigation of about 14% of total emission from crop sector has been achieved.
