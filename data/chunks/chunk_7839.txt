 The bioactive compound in Costus speciosus is diosgenin and in Hemidesmus indicus vanillin, which have high market potential and industrial demand. These two compounds were quantified in all the collected samples for identifying the elite germplasms. Significant chemical variations were observed among the germplasms within the same phyto-geographical zone as well as within different zones also. Two elite chemotypes were identified, viz. NBCS- 88 with maximum content of diosgenin (2.405%, on dry weight basis) from Costus speciosus and NBH-35 with maximum content of vanillin (0.0127%, on dry weight basis) from Hemidesmus indicus. Identified elite chemotypes are useful as quality planting material for its commercial cultivation leading to supply of quality raw material (QRM) for herbal drug industries, in turn having huge socio-economic benefit. Energy efficient polyhouse and aeroponic system: Increase in shoot or root zone temperature marginally affected haulm characters but a considerable decrease in tuber number was noticed when the plants were exposed to higher root and shoot zone temperatures grown under aeroponic system. The leads of this study indicated that for every 1°C rise in mean cumulative shoot temperature beyond the threshold of 19.5°C, there is a reduction of 2.3 tubers/plant. Similarly, 1°C raise in mean cumulative aeroponic chamber (root-zone) temperature beyond 18.4°C, the tuber number also reduced by 3.5. The expression of tuberization signal SP6A and positive regulator BEL5 decreased at high temperature and is correlated with tuber production (number). In polyhouse with the mean maximum temperatures of 32.83°C and mean minimum temperatures of 15.09°C of shoot zone, a significant improvement in mini tuber production was achieved by maintaining optimum aeroponic chamber temperatures (18–20°C). Using LED light panels, the plants, exposed to specific light spectra mainly in the red region achieved substantial reduction in the etiolation under polyhouse conditions with low light intensities. Marginal improvement in tuberization was achieved when plants were exposed to near far-red light (730 nm). Improvement of salt tolerance in crops: At a salt concentration of EC 50 dS/m, total 112,218 genes were differentially expressed with 120,231 and 113,280 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at EC 30 and 40 dS/m respectively. The Venn diagram showed that 1,065 transcripts (2.8%) were commonly upregulated at EC 30 and 40 dS/m; 11,209 (29.2%) transcripts between EC 40 and 50 dS/m; and 1627 transcripts (4.2%) were common at EC 30 and 50 dS/m in Urochondra. In Dichanthium, out of total 147,851 differentially expressed transcripts, 29,482 transcripts were upregulated and 42,425 transcripts were downregulated.
