 Nursery should be kept free from weeds by mechanical method or by the use of Butachlor granules 5G @30 kg/ha in the puddled soil after the emergence of first leaf. In case of dry sowing, sow the seeds in lines 5cm apart and 3cm deep. yy For nursery sowing, immerse the seed in water in 1:1 ratio using Carbendazim 0.2% or Thiram 0.3% plus Streptocycline 100ppm (1g/10 L of water) for 12 hours and sow directly. This will take care of seed infection of blast, sheath rot/blight, brown leaf spot and bacterial leaf blight. yy Recommended varieties (upto 800 m elevation zone of Jammu) are IET 1410, China-1039, K-39, Ratna, PC-19, Jaya, RR-8585 (Ajay) Basmati 370, Ranbir Basmati, Saanwal Basmati and hybrids KRH- 2 and PHB-71. Whereas for intermediate zone (800-1500 m), varieties recommended are China-1039, Saanwal Basmati, K-39, K-84, K-343, having southern aspect and Giza-14, where hailstorms are frequent. yy Use 40-45 kg/ha seed for coarse varieties, 35-40 kg/ha for semi fine varieties and 15kg/ha for hybrids. Rainfed Maize yy Sowing of maize in intermediate zone (800- 1500 m) elevation can be done upto 15th of May. Recommended varieties for sowing are Super Composite (Mansar), C-6, Vijay and Local Tall. 35-40 kg seed is required for sowing one hectare at higher elevation; 20 kg/ha (line sown crop) yy Treat seed with Thiram/Captan 0.3% (3g/kg of seed) or Carbendazim @ 2g/kg of seed for control of smuts, blights and seed/seedlings rots. Treat seed with Chlorpyriphos (20EC) @ 5ml/kg of seed against cut- worm in epidemic areas. 27 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy Apply 15 tonnes of FYM/ Compost 2-3 weeks before sowing and reduce 25% of NPK from the recommended dose of nutrients. Apply recommended dose of NPK, ZnSO4 @ 60, 40, 20 and 10 kg/ ha, respectively. yy Maintain a row to row spacing of 75 cm for hybrid maize and 60 cm for composite varieties with plant-to-plant distance of 20 cm. Keep the field free of weeds atleast up to 40 DAS. Two weedings cum hoeings should be given first at 15 days and second at 30 days after sowing where no herbicide has been applied. yy Earthing up is done when the crop is at knee high stage i.e. one month after sowing. For chemical weed control, apply Atrazine @1kg/ha in 800-1000 litres of water as pre-emergence herbicide. However, if need be, one weeding should be given at 30days after sowing. Vegetables yy In intermediate lower zone, nursery of Brinjal (Pusa Purple Long, Pusa Purple Cluster, Pusa Purple Round); Chillies (NP-46 A, PusaJwala) in sub-tropical zone, Cauliflower (Pusa Deepali) may be taken. In intermediate higherzone, Brinjal, Chillies, Cabbage (Golden Acre, Pride of India), Cauliflower (Pusa Snowball, Snowball-16, Pusa Snowball K-1) and Knolkhol (White Vienna and Purple Vienna) can be sown. yy In temperate/intermediate higher zone, transplanting of tomato ((Pusa Ruby, S-1, Marglobe) at 60x45 cm, Brinjal (PPL, PPC, PPR, Pusa Kranti) at 60x45 cm and Knolkhol (White Vienna) at 30x20 cm can be done.
