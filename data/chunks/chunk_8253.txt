 The project includes farm and field based co-operating centres located in various ICAR Institutes and State Agriculture/Veterinary Universities. Presently, there are 6 ongoing co-operating centres with its co-ordinating unit at ICAR-CSWRI, Avikanagar. Four of these centres are farm based, while two are field based. Avishaan – A prolific triple breed cross of sheep Marwari, Muzaffarnagri, Deccani and Nellore sheep are maintained under farm units for improvement through selection and production of superior germplasm. Rams and ewes of Marwari, Muzaffarnagri, Deccani, Nellore and Magra sheep were sold for genetic Performance of farm flocks Breed/ Average body weights (kg) Particulars Birth 3 M 6 M 9 M 12 M Marwari 3.37 17.90 25.11 29.98 34.55 Muzaffarnagri 3.53 16.21 24.61 28.21 35.45 Deccani 3.29 14.87 20.58 22.20 25.04 Magra 3.28 18.53 26.90 32.80 35.67 Nellore 3.01 15.50 21.00 22.88 25.28 DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 56 LIVESTOCK IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 57 CSWRI, Avikanagar for Malpura breed. The project aims at improvement of indigenous sheep breeds by providing superior germplasm to the farmers through production and distribution of elite rams as well as estrus synchronization of ewes coupled with artificial insemination with freshly diluted liquid semen. Flocks of sheep, viz. Chottanagpuri (789), Mandya (417), Mecheri (631), Sonadi (428) and Malpura (912) were built up for the production of high performing sheep seed. Superior rams were distributed to registered farmers for improvement of their flock. Goat Genetic Improvement Programme: Selective breeding is being carried out to improve the production performance and to fulfil the need of the genetically superior bucks in their breeding tract. Selective breeding of Jamunapari, Barbari and Jakhrana goats resulted in significant improvement in body weights and milk yields. A positive genetic trend was recorded for milk yield in Jamunapari goat population showing significant improvement in milk yield over the years for both 90 and 140 days of lactation. Eight multiplier flocks were established in Agra and Mathura district to increase the availability of Barbari bucks for genetic improvement of the breed in the field. Pig Crossbred pig varieties: Rani and Asha, new and improved crossbred varieties of pigs, were released by ICAR-NRC on Pig, Rani. The crossbred pig variety Rani was developed by crossing Hampshire (exotic breed) with Ghungroo (indigenous breed) to have 50% inheritance of both the breeds. The breed characters of Rani crossbred have been stabilized through consistent interse-mating of six generations. The breed can attain 75 kg body weight at slaughter age of 8 months with 1.98 cm of back fat thickness. Rani cross has also been validated in farmers’ field. Improving goat productivity in Farmers’ flock AICRP on Goat Improvement is operational at 461 villages covering 3,840 farmers. Performance recording was carried out in 25,622 animals during the year.
