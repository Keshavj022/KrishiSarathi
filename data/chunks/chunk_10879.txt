 Dry Seeded Rainfed Un-Puddled Lowland Rice with Supplemental Irrigation   Apply recommended dose of fertilizer 75:25:37.5 kg N:P2O5:K2O /ha   Apply a basal dose of 750 kg of FYM enriched with fertilizer phosphorus (P at 25 kg/ha)   Apply N & K in three splits at 20-25, 40-45 and 60-65 days after germination.   Each split may follow 25kg N and 12.5 kg K2O.   If the moisture availability is substantial, split application at panicle initiation may be done with 40 kg N and 12.5 kg K2O.   If the moisture availability is substantial, the split at 40-45 DAS (panicle initiation) may be applied up to 40kg N and 12.5kg K2O to enhance the growth and the grain yield. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 161 Dry seeded irrigated Un-puddled Lowland Rice   Apply FYM/compost at 12.5 t/ha or 750 kg of FYM enriched with 50 kg P2O5 as basal dose in clay soils of Nagapattinam / Thiruvarur district.   Apply recommended dose of fertilizer 75:50:37.5 kg N:P2O5:K2O /ha   N and K in three splits at around 20-25, 40-45 and 60-65 days for short duration varieties or four splits for medium duration varieties at around 20-25, 40-45, 60-65 and 80-85 days after germination is suitable.   Each split may follow 25kg N and 12.5 kg K2O.   If the moisture availability is substantial and canal water received from tillering phases itself, the split at panicle initiation (40-45 DAS in short duration and 60-65 DAS in medium duration) may be applied up to 40kg N and 12.5kg K2O to enhance the growth and the grain yield. Blackgram/ Greengram   High yielding black gram varieties, VBN 8, VBN 9, VBN 10 & VBN 11; Green gram varieties, CO 8, VBN 3, VBN 4, VBN 5 & KKM 1; Seed treatment with imidacloprid 48 FS @ 5 ml / kg of seed; seed drill sowing to maintain optimum plant population; Installation of micro sprinklers (must be provided under MI scheme of Central / State Govt.) application of pre emergence herbicides or early hand weeding before 15 – 20 DAS; Installation of traps.   To mitigate moisture stress 2 % KCl + 100 PPM boric acid spray is recommended.   Seed hardening with 100 PPM ZnSO4 (10 g/100 litre of water) for 3 hours soaking in one third of water for germination improvement and withstand the drought   Basal Application of neem cake @ 150 kg/ha, seed treatment with Trichoderma asperellum @ 4 g/kg and soil application of Trichoderma asperellum @ 2.5 kg/ha at 30 DAS will reduce the root rot incidence in Pulses   Spray imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 100 ml/ha or thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 100 g/ha   To control Spodoptera litura, growing castor along field bund is recommended. Spraying of chlorantraniliprole 18.5 % SC @ 150 ml/ha is recommended if it is above ETL.   Foliar spray of PPFM (Pink Pigmented Facultative Methylotrophs) @ 1% solution (10ml/litre of water) at critical stages of crop or at 30 days interval to mitigate the drought in rainfed condition.
