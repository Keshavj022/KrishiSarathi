 Workshop on Quantitative Techniques for Impact Assessment in PAU, Ludhiana Training on the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) in ICAR-NIAP 40 T he International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) works with partners worldwide to enhance the roles that livestock play in food security and poverty alleviation, principally in Africa and Asia. The outcomes of these research partnerships help people in developing countries to keep their farm animals alive and productive to increase and sustain their livelihood and farm productivity, find profitable markets for their animal products, and reduce the risk of livestock- related diseases. Supporting the many small-scale producers, processors, sellers and consumers of animal-source foods in low-income countries, ILRI works with partners to change practices, provide evidence to decision-makers and develop capacities in smallholder livestock development. ILRI’s corporate strategy articulates three strategic objectives and the underpinning five critical success factors that will be addressed to achieve the institute’s mission: ‘To improve food and nutritional security and to reduce poverty in developing countries through research for efficient, safe and sustainable use of livestock – ensuring better lives through livestock’. The recently completed science strategy further articulates the key elements of the critical success factor ‘getting the science right’, which includes different research areas that need to be addressed by the institute’s research to different degrees depending on the trajectory in question. The science strategy also highlights the importance of ILRI’s regional programs in implementing its research and ensuring that impact pathways are realised in local and regional contexts, whilst delivering global public goods. ILRI is a CGIAR Research Centre which undertakes multi-partner ‘CGIAR Research Programs’ (CRPs) and these set the scope, direction, institutional partnerships and opportunities for ILRI research in India. In last several years, ILRI has successfully implemented a number of collaborative projects in the region including Cereal System Initiative South Asia (CSISA), Enhancing livelihoods through livestock knowledge systems (ELKS), National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP), Milk India Tanzania (MilkIT) project, Farm Animal Genetics Resources (FAnGR), India Mozambique Goat (IMGoat) project, Climate change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) etc. and set a positive track record as a scientifically sound, honest, sincere, responsive and flexible research institute that is good to work with.
