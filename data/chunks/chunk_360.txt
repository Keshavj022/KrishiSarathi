 Reproductive and management parameters to achieve optimum reproductive efficiency Parameter Mean Range Age at puberty (months) 30 16 – 46 Weight at puberty (kg) 275 200 – 350 Length of estrous cycle (days) 21 17 – 25 Length of estrus (hr.) 10 5 - 27 Time of ovulation After the onset of estrus (hr.) 34 24 – 48 After the end of estrus (hr.) 14 6 – 21 Length of gestation (days) River type 310 300 – 320 Swamp type 330 320 – 340 Birth weight of calves (kg) 26 22 – 36 Involution of uterus (days) 30 25 – 35 Source: Parera 2008 Genetics (Breed improvement by upgrading, genotype modifications, crossbreeding) Nutritional management (feed rich in fibre, minerals, feed additives), sufficient water, feeding schedule General management (plenty of shades, sprinkler, ventilation) Health (Regular vaccination, deworming, timely reproductive check up) Locally prevalent techniques (ingenious heat protection from stress, plant extracts as feed additives) Indian Farming 32 December 2023 is recommended to compensate the calving stress. Buffalo farmers must take adequate care to avoid postpartum complications such as hemorrhage, perineal injuries, edema and prolapse of genitalia. It is advisable that fetal membranes are not removed using force to avoid injuries leading to bleeding. Until dams develop hyperthermia with signs of putrifying retained fetal membranes, it is not a cause of grave concern. Flooring of the sheds should be non-slippery. Maintaining adequate sanitary precaution coupled with introduction of dry- cow therapy under guidance of a veterinarian shall help in reducing the incidences of mastitis. Daily cleaning of teats by water and 0.5% lugol’s solution or potassium per magnate solution shall significantly reduce the infection of udders with opportunistic bacteria. Herd target indicators and interference level For farmers maintaining large herd of buffaloes, it is important that they keep an eye on targets and interference levels for various parameters for increasing productivity as discussed below. These targets and interference levels are set a bit higher than cattle and are adjusted for buffaloes under Indian conditions. Though it is possible to estimate the estrus detection rate but remember that it is an estimate and not an accurate measurement. An interval of 36-48 days (2 x 18 - 24) indicates that an estrus has been missed, whereas an interval of 54- 72 days (3 x 18 - 24) suggest that 2 estrus have been missed. Mean calving to 1st service interval and to conception (pregnancy) interval (days) It is important that following uneventful calving dams undergo complete involution of genitalia as quickly as possible. This ensures quick return to estrus. On an average target for ‘Mean calving to 1st service interval’ in days for a optimally managed buffalo herd may be set at 85 and if it were to increase to 95 days (Interference level) then buffalo farmer must investigate the reasons for such delays.
