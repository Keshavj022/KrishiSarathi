 India is believed to be its centre of origin. In round melon improvement programme, attention should be focussed on development of early, green, shiny, uniform, flattish round high yielding genotypes having white, tender, less-seeded flesh. Keeping these facts in view, a round melon variety Pusa Raunak was developed by Division of Vegetable Science, ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. Indian Horticulture 28 Table 1.

In multi-location testing, Pusa Raunak has average yield of 6.71, 8.48 and 5.85 t/ha at IARI Regional Station, Karnal; KVK, Shikohpur; and KVK, Ujwa, respectively (Tables 2, 3, 4). Disease and pest management Red pumpkin beetle attacks the plant and feeds away the leaves. It can be controlled by spraying of Carbosulfan 20 EC @ 2 g/litre of water. The adult of fruit fly insect punctures the skin of young fruit and lay eggs. The maggot starts feeding the flesh of the fruit and infected fruit become deformed. The affected fruit should be picked and destroyed. Fruit fly can be effectively controlled by spraying of Malathion @ 2 ml/litre of water and use of poison bait and pheromone trap to trap and kill the adult flies. A need based spray of Imidachlorpid @ 0.3 ml/l or acetamiprid @ 0.3 g/litre of water followed by Dimecron @ 2ml/litre of water at two weeks interval should be applied judiciously to prevent the crop from important sucking pests like aphid and whitefly. High summer rainfall and high humidity is conducive for the spread of downy mildew disease. Symptoms appear as reddish brown spot on the upper surface and greyish black spot on the lower surface of leaves.
