 Capacity building on climate resilient agriculture benefitting 5.15 lakhs stakeholders including farmers has been undertaken. DARE-ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2014-2021 36 The organic farming has been identified important for augmenting income of the farmers and also arresting the soil degradation. To accomplish this task, developed 37 organic farming packages of practices during 2014-21 against 14 during 2007-13. The Climate Resilient technology practice demonstrated at 13138 farmers’ fields during 2014-21 against 5241 during 2007-2014. Vulnerability Atlas of Indian Agriculture: Based on the framework of IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report, district level risk and vulnerability assessment of agriculture to climate change indicated 193 districts of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka under ‘high’ or ‘very high’ vulnerable category. Climate change risk is ‘very’ high’ in 109 districts of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Odisha, and ‘high’ in 201 districts of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Maharashtra, etc. The focused efforts to address the climate change in the high risk or high vulnerability districts needs to be taken in accordance of the sources of the vulnerability. Updation of 435 District Agriculture Contingency Plans (DACPs): These updated plans provide contingency measures and technological solutions for minimising the impact of weather aberrations. The two- step implementation of district plans involves preparedness and real- time activation of the contingency measures. Also, developed 24 district drought proofing action plans for Karnataka (16), Andhra Pradesh Climate change research facilities at CRIDA, Hyderabad DARE-ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2014-2021 37 (4) and Rajasthan (4) states. These action plans were further taken up by National Rainfed Area Authority for implementation along with respective state governments on pilot basis. Organised 15 interface meetings with Department of Agriculture of different states to enhance their preparedness for addressing weather aberrations. H. Farm Mechanization and Post-Harvest Operations The total machine developed during 2014-21 were 230 against 218 farm machines during 2007-14. The farm machine prototypes development increased to 25719 during 2014-21 against 23499 during 2007-13. This has helped availability of new farm machines to farmers for higher efficiency in farm operations with less drudgery. ICAR supported the establishment of agricultural machinery custom hiring centers in Madhya Pradesh. During 2014-21, a total of 1261 rural youth were trained and supported for establishment of custom hiring centres by ICAR-CIAE as against 255 during 2007-14. ICAR supported the establishment of agro- processing centers for capacity development of the entrepreneurs in the food processing and post-harvest management.
