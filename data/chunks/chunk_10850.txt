   Pest resistant or tolerant varieties like like Pusa Jwala or Pusa Jyoti should be used for planting. Tomato:   Triple disease resistant varieties of tomato like Arka Rakshak or Arka Samrat should be used for higher yield. Okra:   For management of fruit borer in okra take a spray of 5 % NSKE or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 % SC @ 2.5 ml or Cypermethrin 10 % EC @ 15 ml or Quinalphos 25 % EC @ 20 ml per 10 liter of water.   Harvesting of mature vegetables should be done early in the morning.   Irrigation management should be done early in the morning, at evening or during night time in vegetable crops as per availability and requirement of crop.   Management practices should be followed to protect the vegetable crops from hot air. Brinjal:   If incidence of shoot and fruit borer observed in Brinjal, collect and destroy caterpillar or Spray Neemark 4 % or Cypermethrin 25% EC 5 ml or Chlorpyriphos 20 EC 20 ml OR Deltamethrin 1 % or Traizophos 20 ml per 10 litres of water. Turmeric:   Harvesting, boiling, drying, polishing operations are being carried out in turmeric crop.   To save the crop from unseasonal rains or hailstorm, crop should not be stored in open place.   The harvested turmeric crop should be covered by plastic paper so that it should not be damaged by rains. Livestock:  Animal Protection:To protect the animals from high temperature, apply white paint to the roof of shade. Apply mulching on the roof of shade with the help of dry grass and trash of sugarcane which reduces the temperature in shade. If water is spry on mulches or use of foggers will cool down the temperature of shade.Precaution should be taken so that the harvested dry Stover of sorghum may not damage due to rainfall, if it happens the quality as well as storage capacity of dry Stover decrease and animals not prefer such type of fodder.  Foddermanagement: Use Maize African Tall and new varieties of hybrid napier like Phule Gunwant, DHN-6, BNH-10 and Super Napier for round the year availability of green fodder. Excess green fodder should be converted into silage.  Milch Animals:Provide clean, hygienic and plenty amount of drinking water to milch animals. To reduce the stress of heat in farm animals, provide roughages by mixing with solution of 1% jaggery and 0.5% salt separately. Milch animals should be offered 50 gm of mineral mixture daily in two divided doses to maintain milk yield and to overcome the problem of anoestrous cycle.Cow teats should be dipped in 2 % solution of Potassium Permanganate after every ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 126 milking to avoid Mastitis in milch animals. Regular deworming should be done after every two monthsfor one yearfor good health and weight gain of calves.  Buffalo: Allow buffalo for wallowing in water as they have fewer sweet glands compared to cattle to maintain their body’s thermo equilibrium. Water-soaked gunny bag or other cloth should kept on a body to avoid occurrence of heat stroke.
