Agri-R&D pre-independence and collaborations The institutional mechanisms of agricultural development in India started as early as 1869, when Lord Mayo, Governor General in India proposed the Department of Agriculture in the Government of India with its counterparts in the provinces. Twenty years later in 1889, the Imperial Bacteriological laboratory was established in Pune which was later shifted to Mukteshwar in 1895 and subsequently development of its campus at Izatnagar, Bareilly in 1913. However, the first organized and geographically balanced initiative was introduced by Lord Curzon, in 1905 and the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute was established at Pusa, Bihar followed by 6 agricultural colleges in the different provinces, besides central institutions. In 1929, on the recommendations of Royal Commission on Agriculture, Imperial Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) was set up under the Registration of Societies Act 1860. Few Commodity Committees were also existing at the time of establishment of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. These Committees used to provide advisory services to the government and on a limited scale taken up research on cotton, lac, jute, sugarcane, coconut, tobacco, oilseeds, arecanut, spices and cashewnut, etc. Majority of these activities were standalone and limited to a delineated geography with least domestic collaboration and almost absent international linkages. 3. Agri-R&D post-independence and collaborations In 1951, the Ford Foundation, a US based NGO signed an agreement with Government of India for providing a support of US$ 1.2 million for the capacity development of Indian personnel in community development programme (Perkins 1990).
