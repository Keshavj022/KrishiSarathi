 Although budget release guidelines are uniform across zones, the actual release and utilization showed signiﬁcant differences due to implementation problems, diversion of funds and low government capabilities in some states. This study shows that although the utilization of funds was better in the eastern and western zones, progress in terms of area and number of farmers under PKVY was better in the central and southern zones (Table 5). These regional glitches need to be addressed. Sustainability 2022, 14, 15057 16 of 22 Figure 8. Budget allocation, release and expenditure (Rs. in lakh) under the PKVY scheme. Note: 1 lakh = 100,000.

Policy Analysis and Conclusions The blanket adoption of organic farming may reduce the yield of the crops and would affect the food security and the welfare of the consumers and producers, as noted in the economic surplus model [43–45]. However, the economic surplus model shows that expanding organic agriculture in rainfed and hilly areas will be more beneﬁcial at the farmer and national levels [46–49]. Therefore, a location-speciﬁc strategy is more effective than the blanket recommendation for organic farming. The government needs to identify the areas that can be brought under organic farming, prioritize these areas and build a “Geographical Indication” tag to obtain a premium price. As a general principle, by default, rainfed, hilly and tribal areas where the farmers use fewer chemical fertilizers can be prioritized for conversion toward organic farming. Identifying and mapping these default organic growing areas and focusing on saturation, vertical expansion and brand building are low-hanging fruit in promoting organic agriculture. Hence, the government should prioritize these strategies. Identifying contiguous areas covering between 300 and 1000 farmers as the organic cluster will help in reaping scale economies for providing support services such as transport and marketing. The whole-area approach (saturation) may be followed before venturing into new areas.
