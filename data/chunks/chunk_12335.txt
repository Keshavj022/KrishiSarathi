 High incidence of insect pest due to high humidity. 5. Non adherence of recommended package and practices. 6. Inadequate availability of quality seeds. 7. Low light intensity during the Kharif season. 8. Lack of awareness about the new varieties/technologies Animal husbandry The reasons for the yield gap are - 1. Less availability of superior germplam 2. Low availability of quality feed and fodder 3. Lack of awareness about scientific farming 4. Poor health care and biosecurity 5. Non adherence of recommended package and practices. 6. Low access to extension. 7. Low access to credit. 8. Free grazing system. Fisheries The state has vast potential fisheries resources which are yet to be explored. There is a gap of 0.63 lakh tonnes. However, the Department of Fisheries, Govt. of Assam claims that ultimate potential is 400,000 tonnes fish annually. The reasons for the yield gap are - 1. Low water pH. 2. Low temperature during September to March (below 280 C) 3. Improper pond management. 4. High stocking. 5. Low feeding. State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 47 6. Siltation and eutrophication in beels. 7. Indiscriminate fishing 8. Damage of breeding grounds. Horticulture It is estimated that there is an average post harvest crop loss of 30% in case of fruits. A large share of these surplus quantities can be easily explored for exports in fresh and processed forms The reasons for the yield gap are -   Insufficiency of quality planting materials particularly in case of vegetatively propagated fruits crops like khasi mandarin, guava, mango etc.   Absence of standard scion bank in case of khasi mandarin as well as root stock most of the citrus orchard suffering from the problem of citrus die-back due to occurrence of Triestza virus.   Shortage of micro-propagation and plant disease diagnostic facility like TC lab, Diagnostic lab i.e. Plant health clinic etc.   Lack of sufficient accredited nursery in the state for generation of quality planting materials due to absence of proper mother as well as rootstock blocks.   Scattered nature of cultivation due to fragmented land holding by small and marginal farmers hindering the way of commercial horticulture.   Unfavorable climatic condition for most of the horticultural crops characterized by excess and uneven rainfall.   Poor socio-economic condition of the farmers for availing hi tech options like micro irrigation, protected cultivation etc.   Huge post harvest loss to the tune of 40% due to poor cold chain infrastructure.   Unorganized marketing system hampering coverage of cultivation cost by farmers. Strategy for Doubling Farmers’ Income by 2022 A strategy for agricultural development in Assam should be built around two elements, namely, (a) promoting the rabi season as the engine for agricultural growth and (b) aggressively pushing for commercialization of agriculture.
