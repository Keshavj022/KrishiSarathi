 The current push to promote “eat local”, would lead to having more fresh, high quality food and to leave a low carbon footprint by reducing transportation of food, thus, benefitting the local farmers, rural economy, soil health and ecology. This is an important strategy for climate action, one of the important SDGs. 4. Lessons Learnt and Way Forward India ranks second in the world agricultural production and is the leading producer of food grains, horticultural crops, cotton, dairy and poultry, aquaculture, and spices. India’s agricultural GDP rose from $25 billion (1970s) to $401 billion (2017), registering a stupendous growth of $376 billion out of which $300 billion increase was recorded during the period from 2001-2017 (NAAS Presidential Address, 2019). The net area under cultivation increased from 118.75 Mha (1950-51) 140.86 Mha in 1970-71 and has largely remained constant since then. (Directorate of Economics and Statistics, GOI). Foodgrain production increased from 50.82 million tonnes (1950-51) to 284.95 million tonnes (2018-19). Similarly, horticulture produce of 313.85 million tonnes in 2018-19 showed significant gain as compared to 166.94 million tonnes in 2004-05. The total livestock population increased from 292.80 (1951) to 535.82 (2019) millions. The total fish production increased from 1.536 million tonnes (1990-91) to 13.422 million tonnes (2018-19) (Pocket Book of Agricultural Statistics 2019, GOI). Gandhiji always wanted India to be self-sufficient. “My idea of self-sufficiency is that villages must be self-sufficient in regard to food, cloth and other basic necessities. But even this can be overdone. Therefore, you must grasp my idea properly...” (Gandhi 1959). The Green Revolution in India which had begun in the mid-1960s had been instrumental in transforming from the traditional agriculture to intensive farming. Introduction of high-yielding varieties replaced the traditional rice varieties consumed before the Green Revolution and the availability of local rice varieties has decreased. Many high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of wheat, rice, barley, sorghum, oilseeds, legumes, etc., were developed by ICAR and introduced as part of the Green Revolution to increase agricultural productivity. Farmers could increase their knowledge on improved agronomic measures due to extension services from NARES. This period also coincided with the extensive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides which have significantly impacted the natural resources like soil and water. The overuse of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and mismanagement of soil and water resources degraded the land and groundwater became scarce in agricultural areas. The agriculture sector is undergoing tremendous stress due to various factors both natural vagaries and human mismanagement resulting in farmers’ suicides, malnutrition, economic and livelihood stress, etc.
