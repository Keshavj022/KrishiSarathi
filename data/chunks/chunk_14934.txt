 has pioneered green hydrogen production using plasma-based oxy-gasification of municipal solid waste. While this project focuses on municipal waste, the technology holds the potential for adaptation to agricultural residues, contributing to sustainable hydrogen production. These initiatives reflect India's commitment to leveraging agricultural waste for hydrogen production, contributing to energy sustainability and waste management. These initiatives reflect India’s dedication to advancing clean and sustainable energy solutions. Efforts such as NTPC's plasma-based oxy-gasification and microbial hydrogen production from agricultural residues demonstrate the country's focus on green hydrogen under the National Hydrogen Energy Mission. By leveraging innovative technologies like biomass gasification and waste-to-hydrogen conversion, India is addressing environmental challenges, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and promoting decentralized energy systems. These projects not only manage waste efficiently but also contribute significantly to achieving India’s renewable energy and carbon neutrality goals [109,110]. 8. Conclusion Biomass pyrolysis offers a promising method for decentralized and sustainable hydrogen production in India, capitalizing on the country's abundant biomass resources and sustainability goals. The flexibility enables it to process a variety of agricultural residues and forestry waste, making it especially suitable for India's rural areas, where waste management challenges and a commitment to sustainable practices are key concerns. Biomass pyrolysis also supports the integration of agriculture and forestry sectors, contributing to a circular economy and enhancing overall sustainability. In rural regions, this technology can address energy scarcity, stimulate local economic growth, and foster community participation in energy production. However, the economic viability of using biomass pyrolysis for hydrogen production depends on factors such as the availability of raw materials, initial investment costs, and market demand. Ongoing research aims to optimize these variables to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness. To facilitate the widespread adoption of pyrolysis technology in India, it is crucial to establish regulations and policies that support renewable energy projects, bioenergy development, and biomass utilization. Pyrolysis is recognized as a comprehensive and environmentally friendly approach to hydrogen production, and supportive policies will play a pivotal role in successful implementation and expansion across the country.
