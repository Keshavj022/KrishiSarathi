09 High value aromatic rice (rainy)–potato (winter)–lady’s finger (summer) 4263 7258 6519 49.42 High value aromatic rice (rainy)–capsicum (winter)– vegetable cowpea (summer) 4342 8371 4814 48.02 Export import balance High value crops are very export- friendly and have higher market prices as well as higher market demand. Hence, diversification of conventional cropping system with high value crops such as basmati rice, aromatic rice, spices, onion, cut flower and other vegetable crops are of greater importance. India is not sufficient enough in vegetable oil production, therefore diversifying some area for oilseed crops (mustard, soybean, ground nut etc.) can help India achieving self-sufficiency in vegetable oil production to some extent. However, the suitability of crops for diversification varies place-to-place due to soil, climatic conditions and according to the local preferences. Employment generation and land use efficiency Intensification of cropping systems enhances labour participation in the field, resulting in greater employment generation than conventional rice-based farming systems. Labour employment was maximum with high value rice– potato–lady’s finger (357) followed by high value rice– capsicum– vegetable cowpea (305) (Table 3). In a field experiment, Karchoo et al. (2014) reported that rice–pea– lady’s finger showed higher land use efficiency of 91% followed by rice–fenugreek (methi)–radish (89.65%) and rice–garlic–cowpea (86.6%) compared to 71% land use efficiency under traditional rice- wheat cropping system. Profitability High value crops are those with a higher market value than other traditional cereal crops. In a field study at Varanasi, cropping system with high-value rice– potato–lady’s finger and high-value rice– capsicum–vegetable cowpea recorded 37% and 45% more system profitability over conventional rice– wheat cropping system (Table 3).

If productivity is to be boosted in India, the availability of power on the farm must be increased. For timely and quality tillage, irrigation, harvesting, and threshing, more electricity is required. The Indian economy has Indian Farming 16 November 2023 been harmed by the global energy crisis caused by fuel shortages and high petroleum prices. To alleviate the difficulty, non-renewable energy sources must be conserved, and existing conventional energy sources must be managed efficiently. Legumes need less energy than grains and oilseeds in the field.
