 Matrixnormalized = Xij ∑ i j Xij (2) Further, the ‘Weighted Sum Vector’ was calculated to determine any inconsistencies among the parameters (Saaty, 2001). The value of CR (Eq. (4)) should be below or equal to 10 per cent or 0.1. CR = CI RI (3) The Consistency Index and Random Index (Table 2) define the CR value, which is the ratio of CI and RI. The average score of the Consis­ tency Vector (CV) (Eq. (4)) was used to measure the Consistency Index (CI) (Eq. (6)). cv = [wsv1 vw1 ] (4) The consistency index effectiveness is based on the lambda (γmax) value (Eq. (5)). The higher lambda value shows high inconsistency (Saaty, 1977). γmax = ∑ n i=1 CVi n (5) CI = γmax −n n −1 (6) where, WSV: Weighted Sum Vector; VW: Variable Weight; CV: Con­ sistency Vector; λ max: Highest Eigen Value; n: No. Of Criteria; CI: Consistency Index; CR: Consistency Ratio, and RI: Random Index. 3.2.1.2. FUZZY COPRAS method. The COPRAS (Complex Proportional Assessment) method is an MCDM method developed by Zavadskas and Kaklauskas in 1996. The matrix and variable weights are computed using Eqs. (7) and (8). Table 2 The AHP Scale and Random Index for paired comparison.

Saha and P. Mondal Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 179–191 183 Vrating = ⎡ ⎢⎢⎣ D1 m = l m u D2 m = l m u D3 m = l m u ⎤ ⎥⎥⎦ (7) Where, Vrating is the rating assigned by several decision-makers of a particular variable; ’l′′m′′u’ is the lower, middle, and upper weight of the variable; ‘Dm’ is the decision-maker (Table 3; Table 4). After formulation of the tabulation of the weights of the variables assigned by the decision-makers, the Fuzzy-aggregation technique has been employed (Turanoglu Bekar et al., 2016) (Eq. (8)). FA = (l + l + l n ) ; (m + m + m n ) ; (u + u + u n ) (8) Where, FA is the Fuzzy Aggregation of the fuzzy weights; n is the number of decision-makers. After the fuzzy aggregation, the AHP normalised matrix values have been used to form a fuzzy weighted normalised decision matrix (Eq. (9)). xw m = [ AHPn−matrix ⊗FA l,m,u] (9) To normalise the primary pair-wise matrix Eq. (4) was applied to it. Using Eqs. (10) and (11), the values of the benefit and cost variables were estimated. FBi = ∑ k j=1 Nij (10) FCi = ∑ m j=k+1 Nij (11) Where ‘FBi’ is the Fuzzy benefit variable and ‘FCi’ is the Fuzzy cost variable. After the classification of variables into benefit and cost variables, the relative significance (Ri) of each alternative has been estimated using Eq. (12). Ri = FBi + min(FCi) × ∑ n i=1 FCi FCi × ∑ n i=1 ( min(FCi) FCi ) (12) Where, ‘Ri’ is the relative significance. Furthermore, the utility degree of each alternative (Table 5) has been calculated using Eq. (13).
