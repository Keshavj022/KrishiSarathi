 Quality seed production: During the year 2022- 23, total production of quality seed including all classes was 3,86,649.6 q against the target of 3,34,507.9 q. ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 38 precocious, cluster bearer with curved pod and suitable for high density planting (5 m × 5 m). Fruit ripens in 290-320 days from fruit set and pods are uniform in shape. It has 107.23 kg/plant (167.27 q/ha) productivity (15-year-old tree) with 25 g fruit weight, 70.20 degree brix TSS, acidity 14%, total sugar 59.90%, Vitamin C 17.5 mg/100 g, protein 3.3 mg/100 g, calcium 177.72 mg/100 g, magnesium 44.19 mg/100 g and phosphorus 70.8 mg/100 g. Coconut Dweep Haritha: This coconut variety has been recommended for coconut growing tracts of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Kerala. The palms attain height of 6.92 m in 38 years after planting.
