Weather Monitoring. IoT weather stations can provide localized and real-time weather data speciﬁc to the farm’s location. Farmers can use this information to plan their agri- cultural activities, safeguard against extreme weather events, and reduce climate-related risks. 3.1.6. Supply Chain Optimization. IoT can be used to track the movement of agricultural products from the farm to the consumer.
