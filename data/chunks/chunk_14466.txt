68 in ACZ I of Punjab and Haryana, respectively. Fig. 13 depicts that mean NVSWI showed an increasing trend while the mean groundwater level had a declining trend. In case of ACZ II of Punjab, the mean groundwater level was 11 m bgl in the year 2002 and declined to 25 m bgl in the year 2020 (Fig. 13 (b)), while in case of Haryana, it was 9 m bgl and reached 17 m bgl in the year 2020 (Fig. 13 (d)). The mean NVSWI and the mean groundwater level in Punjab and Haryana exhibited a moderate and Fig. 11. Spatio-temporal variations in groundwater level (Pre monsoon: April) from 2001 to 2020 L. Kaur et al. Agricultural Water Management 274 (2022) 107956 16 strong negative trend of −0.422 and −0.72, respectively, indicating a significant use of groundwater irrigation and monsoon vagaries. The ACZ II in both the states heavily rely on the groundwater for agricultural production. The groundwater level in this zone is declining at an alarming rate and some areas are also facing the problems of water shortage and deeper water table. Moreover, ACZ II also remained green in most of the years during the period of study, which is clear reflection of groundwater use for irrigational practices. The NVSWI in ACZ II of Punjab remained higher than the other two zones till 2012–2013, and it was mostly at the cost of groundwater. The mean groundwater level in Punjab’s ACZ III was 10 m bgl in 2002 and declined to 17 m bgl in 2020 [Fig. 13 (b)], whereas NVSWI values showed a mixed trend in the ACZ II of Punjab [Fig. 13 (a)] and increasing trend in Haryana [Fig. 13 (c)]. It also indicated a moderate negative correlation of −0.49 and −0.39 between NVSWI and groundwater level in Punjab and Haryana, respectively. The Mann Kendall trend analysis along with Sen’s slope is given in Table 3. The trends at 95% and 99% confidence level (α = 0.05 * and Fig. 12. Spatio-temporal variations in groundwater level (Post Monsoon: October) from 2001 to 2019. L. Kaur et al. Agricultural Water Management 274 (2022) 107956 17 α = 0.01 **) show that there is a significant trend for NVSWI and groundwater level in Punjab and Haryana except for ACZ II in Punjab and ACZ III in Haryana. The highest increase in NVSWI were observed in ACZ I (+1.23), ACZ III (+1.13) of Haryana and ACZ I (+1.05) of Punjab. As per the Sen’s slope estimator (Qmed), ACZ III of Punjab exhibited a 0.64/year increase while the ACZ II of Haryana reflected an increase of 0.67/ year in NVSWI. However, the NVSWI values in the ACZ II of Punjab have not shown any significant increasing trend, but a significant decreasing trend of −0.76/year was observed in groundwater level in this zone. It reflects that agriculture in this zone was mostly based on irrigation from groundwater and NVSWI values almost remained high from 2002 to 2020 but kept on oscillating [Fig. 13(a)], hence the trend was not sig­ nificant. According to Sen’s slope (Qmed), ACZ II of Haryana also pre­ sented a highly significant negative trend of −0.
