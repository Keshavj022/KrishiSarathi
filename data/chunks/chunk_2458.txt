Main recommendations are given below: 1. Almost all QRTs found that linkages of KVKs under NGOs with SAUs, ICAR are either missing or weak. 2. Holding of LMC (now SAC) meeting were crucial for development and proper functioning of the KVKs. It was recommended that Director of Extension Eduxation of SAUs/CAU should act as Co-Chairman and hold meeting in the absence of VC as Chairman on scheduled dates. 3. The DG, ICAR may take up the issue of ban on recruitment of staff in SAUs with the States where the ICAR funded scheme posts are vacant due to ban on recruitment. 4. The selection committee constituted for recruitment should invariably have one representative from AED of ICAR preferably the Zonal Project Director as member for all the KVKs irrespective of category of Host Institutions (SAUs, ICAR and NGOs) 5. QRT recommends that in case of SAUs, despite administrative and financial sanctions and release of funds by ICAR in time, the Universities/Comptroller did not release the money to KVKs. 6. The financial power of Trining Organizer/Chief Training Organizer in SAUs may be enhanced to avoid undue delay in the implementation of the programmes. 7.
