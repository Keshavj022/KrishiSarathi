 The young leaves from vegetative shoots are more affected than reproductive shoots in Zn deficiency. The symptoms of Zn deficiency are also characterized by irregular green bands along the mid-rib and main vein on a background of light yellow to almost white. In very acute cases of Zn deficiency, the leaves turn abnormally narrow and pointed with the tendency to stand upright coupled with extremely reduced size of leaves. As the deficiency progresses, the leaves are affected over the entire periphery of the tree, and the twigs become very thin and later die back rapidly. A profuse development of water sprouts takes place on the main branches of the trunk, while other leaves remain free from Zn deficiency symptoms. In B deficiency, terminal leaves turn necrotic, and shed prematurely. In Mo deficiency, as the leaves grow, yellow spots develop deposits of brown gum on the lower leaf surface which later turn black. Nutrient diagnostics (Leaf analysis and soil-based guide): The author developed the nutrient diagnostics using leaf analysis (Table 1 and 2) and soil analysis from across all seven states in Northeast India. These nutrient diagnostics are the first of its kind to monitor the menacing nutrient deficiencies on a real-time basis in Khasi mandarin. These values fit well with the range of values obtained for high performance mandarin orchards having fruit yield of 45-62/tree. Our observations suggest that soil test or leaf analysis values of high yielding elite mandarin orchards could well serve as a reference. Distribution of nutrient constraints in Khasi Mandarin Using the diagnostics developed for soil fertility showed that Ca was low in as many as 85.2% orchards followed by Mg (83.3%), P (74.1%), Cu (33.3%) and K (20.3%). While using the leaf analysis norms, most of the orchards (79.7–82.4%) were low in Ca and Mg. Table 2.
