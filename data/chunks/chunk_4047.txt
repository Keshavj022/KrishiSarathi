 Use of plant growth substances (PGS) for high temperature tolerance: In tomato, fruit set is badly hampered by the high Day/ Night (D/N) temperatures. It has been reported that fruit set in tomato is reduced drastically if D/N temperature is 34/18°C. ICAR-IIVR has developed two tomato hybrids, i.e. Kashi Adbhut (VRNTH 18283) and Kashi Tapas (VRNTH 19085) that can set fruit at high temperatures (>38/26°C D/N). Plant growth substances (PGS) are also known to enhance fruit set in adverse climatic conditions. At ICAR-IIVR, Varanasi, an experiment on use of PGS in tomato was conducted during summer season (February to June) in 2021 and 2022 when day temperatures reach more than 42°C with night temperature of 30-32°C. In this study, ICAR-IIVR evolved 11 hybrids/advance lines of tomatoes which were evaluated with 3 private-sector hybrids under high temperature condition. Tomato plants were sprayed with 4 different PGS such as proline (10 µmol/L), salicylic Kashi Rituraj: Field view during summer season (May-June) at Varanasi (B) Intervention through grafting technology and use of plant growth substances Grafting tomato on brinjal rootstocks for alleviating water-logging stress: Vegetables like tomato, brinjal, watermelon, melon and cucumber can readily be grafted onto different inter-specific rootstocks with objective to reduce infections by soil-borne pathogens and to enhance the tolerance to abiotic stresses, such as soil salinity, drought, thermal and water-logging.

PGS was sprayed thrice, i.e. 30, 45 and 60 days after transplanting. Experimental findings revealed that maximum fruit set (67.35%) was recorded in Kashi Adbhut variety with use of SNP, whereas the maximum number of fruits/plant was noticed in Kashi Adbhut with use of SA (72.6) followed by SNP (62.9). As far as fruit yield is concerned, the maximum fruit yield of 18.3 kg/plant and 1.81 kg/plant were reported, respectively in Kashi Adbhut (VRNTH 18283) and VRNTH 20132 with spray of SNP. Use of plant growth substances (PGS) for moisture deficit condition: Five moisture deficit tolerant F1s, viz. VRNTH-18-1, VRNTH-18-2, VRNTH-18-3, VRNTH-18-4 and VRNTH-18-5 along with three private-sector hybrids were exposed to moisture deficit conditions at vegetative and reproductive stages. The plants were sprayed with 3 different PGS, i.e. salicylic acid (SA-250 μM), sodium nitro-prusside (SNP-25 μM) and spray of both SNP and SA under irrigated moisture deficit condition (withholding irrigation for 21 days both at vegetative and reproductive stages). Data revealed that 5 hybrids, viz.
