 Conser­ vation agriculture is a good option as it helps achieve better yields, crop diversification, and improved soil quality [46]. For sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture, a mix of modern climate-resilient technologies and traditional practices might be beneficial [47]. To achieve food security, adapting to and mitigating the impact of climate change, along with the adoption of climate-smart agriculture, is vital [48]. 3.8.2. Water resources, water scarcity, and irrigation Recent research has demonstrated that the sustainable use of irrigation water can reduce up to one-tenth of the adverse impact of climate change [49]. The role of groundwater in building resilience is significant. If groundwater is depleted, the impact of increased variability could escalate [34]. Climate change could affect water resources by reducing their availability and reliability, leading to water scarcity in some parts of India. Implementing adaptation strategies could help mitigate groundwater depletion in India [50]. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research is endorsing various practices to manage land and water in many agriculturally vulnerable districts [33]. Agriculture in dry and semi-arid areas, heavily dependent on irrigation, makes them more susceptible to climate change [51]. Smart water management solutions aid in the sustainable use of water and contribute to achieving resilience [52]. Overexploitation of water resources and drastic land-use changes impact the hydrological cycle in many parts of India [53]. Therefore, a policy framework for implementing strategies for farmers’ adaptation to climate change is crucial to mitigate its adverse impacts [54]. Fig. 7.

Baraj et al. Heliyon 10 (2024) e29586 10 Confidence-building through locally adaptable solutions and the holistic efforts of stakeholders is crucial to mitigate the impact of climate change on water resources [55]. 3.8.3. Sustainability and climate resilience Sustainable agricultural practices blend traditional and modern methodologies to conserve resources, thereby achieving climate resilient agriculture [56]. Improved management and biodiversity conservation can create sustainable and productive systems while decreasing environmental pollution [57]. Gender inclusion is essential in decision-making processes to assist women in managing the impacts of climate change [58]. To devise an action-oriented model for sustainable agriculture in India, sustainability indicators specific to different agro-climatic regions are utilized [59].
