This model can be adopted by policymakers to enhance islanders’ income and expand this activity to other inhabited islands. This model of 'Conservation Aquaculture with Community Participation' will give long-term sustainability to the marine ornamental resources along with livelihood generation to the local community. These small-scale aquaculture units can be recognized as the nucleus /satellite centre that collects, propagates, and sells indigenous marine ornamentals and controls the Indian trade from Lakshadweep, which can be identified as the 'Marine Ornamental Hub' of the nation, in the future. SUMMARY The marine ornamentals (fish and shrimp) were collected from Lakshadweep waters and its captive breeding and seed production technology was standardized in the germplasm resource centre of the ICAR-NBFGR, Agatti, Lakshadweep.
