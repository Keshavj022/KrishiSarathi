0 m, Transplant pigeonpea seedling raised in polythene bags Mid-season drought at vegetative stage (1-15 August): Remove every third row in pearl millet and use as fodder, Foliar spray of urea (2%) in sunflower, In kharif fallows adopt ridges and furrows, tied ridges, compartmental, bunding to conserve rain water for raising rabi crops later Mid-season drought reproductive stage (16-31 August): Harvest pearl millet for fodder purpose and allow ratooning, Repeated interculture and weeding, Foliar spray of KCl (2%) in sunflower, Spray anti- transpirant kaolin (4%) on sunflower Terminal drought (1-15 September): Plan for rabi crops horse gram, setaria, sunflower Green gram/ black gram Delayed onset / deficit rainfall situation (15 June - 15 July): Green gram: IPM 2-14, HUM 1, COGG 912, PKV AKM 4, Black gram : KU 301, IPU 2-43, VBG 4-008, WBU 108 Early season drought (16-31 July): Thinning of plant population Mid-season drought at vegetative stage (1-15 August): Foliar spray of urea (2%) or 1 % 19: 19: 19 Mid-season drought reproductive stage (16-31 August): Harvest for vegetable purpose, Harvest at physiological maturity Terminal drought (1-15 September): Harvest at physiological maturity or for fodder purpose, Plan for early rabi crops sorghum, safflower, chick- pea and sesame Sesamum Delayed onset / deficit rainfall situation (15 June - 15 July): Sowing of sesame varieties viz., DS- 1, DSS-9, DS-5, GT-1 can be done, Re-sow within 15 DAS if plant population is less than 30% in adequate available moisture condition. Early season drought (16-31 July): Provide lifesaving irrigation, if possible, Thinning of plant population followed by hand weeding. Mid-season drought at vegetative stage (1-15 August): Follow interculture operations to conserve moisture, Avoid split application of N- fertilizer till sufficient soil moisture, Use of vegetative mulch ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 179 within the rows Mid-season drought reproductive stage (16-31 August): Foliar spray of 2% urea, Provide lifesaving irrigation, if possible Terminal drought (1-15 September): Harvest at physiological maturity to avoid shattering losses, Plan for early rabi crop viz., chickpea, green gram/black gram, sorghum, etc. Cotton Delayed onset / deficit rainfall situation (15 June - 15 July): 15th to 30th June is optimum for sowing.
