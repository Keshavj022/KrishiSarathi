The data pertaining to planting and harvesting operations are presented in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. The results obtained indicate that there was Table 3.

The energy expenditure and cost of operation in harvesting of ginger roots were reduced by 19.8% and 21.43% in treatment T 4 when compared with T3. This is because the impact of energy to penetrate the sickle to the root zone of ginger is not enough; it needed repeated action, which delayed the operation, resulting in more energy expenditure and cost of operation (Table 4). CONCLUSION The guddeli can harvest 0.0053 ha/day compared to 0.0035 ha/day by farmerâ€™s method, i.e. using sickle. Nearly Rs 225 and Rs 1052 ha can be saved respectively in planting and uprooting of ginger roots by using guddeli compared to sickle. not much difference in the field capacity among the treatments. However planting with guddeli reduced the energy expenditure and cost of operation considerably, i.e 36% and 22.5%, respectively in planting and harvesting of ginger (Table 3). This could be achieved because in treatment T 1 the planting operation was carried out by solely women labour in sitting posture, whereas in treatment T 2 it needed both women and men labour. Men labours loosen the soil on Table 4.
