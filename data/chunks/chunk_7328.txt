9 kg) as against the biomass of 14.9 kg for plants grown at ambient CO2 (400 ppm). Plants under 700 ppm CO2 [ECO2] accumulated higher biomass in roots (27%) and stem (52%) as against 19% and 43%, respectively, at 400 ppm CO2. Camel dung vermicompost: Fodder production using camel dung vermi-compost was evaluated. Camel dung collected from corals was sieved to reduce soil content, mixed with leftover crop residues of feed mangers along with cut lawn grass. Use of vermi- compost improved growth and yield of sorghum and oat fodder that was evident from the improvement in plant height and weight of plant. Contribution of shrimp culture practices to greenhouse gas emission: The emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in shrimp farms was quantified during the culture and fallow period. In shrimp farms with a single crop of Litopenaeus vannamei for 110 days, CO2 equivalent emission was 110–134 kg/ha. Single crop with culture period of 110 days, drying period of 105 days, scrapping period of 13 days, and ploughing period of 9 days in a year contributes 17, 32, 9 and 7% of total GHGs emission respectively. In shrimp farms with two crops of L. vannamei per year, the CO2 equivalent emission was 520 kg/ha and 493 kg/ ha after first and second crops of 90 days’ culture, respectively. The first crop culture period of 3.5 months, drying period of 2 months after first crop, second crop culture period of 3.5 months and drying period of 3 months after the second crop in a year contributed to 22, 31, 21 and 26% of total CO2 emission equivalent respectively. K Harit Dhara The effect of feeding of silkworm pupae oil (SPO), changes in archaeal community and protozoa reduction with oil supplementation, a reduction in methane emission could be achieved. In contrast, enteric methane emission in the Harit Dhara supplemented group was significantly reduced by 21% as compared to that of control. It is concluded that supplementation of Harit Dhara significantly decreases the enteric methane emission without affecting nutrient intake and digestibility. — ujsUnz eksnh Hkkjrh; vFkZO;oLFkk dks xfr çnku djus esa efgyk —"kdksa dk ;ksxnku ljkguh; gS] muds bl ;ksxnku dks ekU;rk çnku djus vkSj mUgsa lEekfur djus ds fy, ljdkj }kjk o"kZ ls vDVwcj dks jk"Vªh; efgyk fdlku fnol :i esa euk;k tkrk gS A 2017 15 4.
