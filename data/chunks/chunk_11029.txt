 Some of the biopescticide formulations developed at ICAR are being validated through the network of AICRP-Biological Control of Crop Pests and Diseases. The recent invasions of fall armyworm (FAW) infesting maize and devastating infection of banana by Fusarium cubense TR4 have been successfully managed with microbial agents developed by ICAR. This compendium on “ICAR Technologies: Biopesticides for Eco-friendly Pest Management” is a timely initiative as microorganisms will be playing a vital role in shaping the future of agriculture. With great pleasure I extend my sincere thanks to Dr. T. Mohapatra, Hon'ble Secretary, Department of Agricultural Research and Education and Director General, ICAR for guidance and support in preparation of this compendium. I congratulate all the developers of technologies and thank other editors of this compendium. (T.R.

Pusa 5SD 31 ix Introduction Pests and pathogens cause a major loss of agricultural produce every year. Management of these menace using chemical pesticides and fungicides has come at the cost of long term agricultural sustainability. This non-judicious use of agrochemicals coupled with climate change worsened the situation leading to changes in pest and pathogen behaviour and development of resistance. Microorganisms due to their extraordinary metabolic diversity are known to produce a battery of secondary metabolites including antimicrobial peptides, volatiles, toxins and enzymes. Many such microorganisms have been substantially utilized as biopesticides to control several phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria, nematodes and insect pests. Unlike their chemical counter parts, biopesticides aid to manage pests and pathogens without any adverse effects on soil health and environment. Microbial biopesticides developed with microorganisms like Trichoderma, Beauveria, Metarhizium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas are known for their role in management of pests and pathogens.
