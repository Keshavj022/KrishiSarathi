Diversiﬁed food production must substantially increase to fulﬁl the needs of food security and sustainability for the world’s future population. This study identiﬁed the ﬁner details of diversiﬁcation in India’s 20 agriculturally prosperous states through analyzing the regional trends in agricultural diversiﬁcation. The analysis, which covered the period from 1971–1972 to 2017–2018, showed that agricultural diversiﬁcation has taken place in several states of India.
