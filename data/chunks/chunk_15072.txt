 Community participation is also essential for advancing CRA efforts in India, as it harnesses local expertise, fosters collaboration, and em- powers farmers (Santosh et al., 2020). Through community involve- ment, CRA initiatives can enhance financial literacy, create jobs, and address health issues (Mahesha, 2023). Partnerships with businesses and educational institutions can strengthen these efforts. Additionally, community-led health programs can address local health issues by engaging residents in health awareness campaigns, sanitation projects, and nutrition education (Kadariya et al., 2023). Leveraging farmers’ knowledge and collaborative efforts among stakeholders increases CRA effectiveness, strengthens social networks, and ensures that practices are tailored to specific contexts (Dhawi and Aleidan, 2024; Ma et al., 2023). This collaboration among farmers, NGOs, local governments, and other stakeholders facilitates resource sharing and the exchange of best practices, thereby increasing the effectiveness of CRA initiatives. Community-driven initiatives in CRA can also promote collaborative resource management, such as community-based rainwater harvesting and irrigation schemes, to improve resource efficiency and climate resilience (Kim et al., 2016). Community-driven initiatives promote resource management and engagement in research, advocating for policies that reflect local agricultural needs. They facilitate knowledge-sharing and improve CRA strategies through community involvement (Tay et al., 2024). Furthermore, incorporating CRA prac- tices into India’s broader economic and development goals requires harmonizing agricultural strategies with national economic agendas, poverty alleviation programs, and sustainability targets. The Indian government can incorporate CRA into initiatives like the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) (Pandve, 2009) and PMKSY (URL: https://pmksy.gov.in/), which focus on vital elements of eco- nomic advancement like water efficiency and soil conservation. Endorsing crop diversification, agroforestry, minimum tillage, and mixed farming boosts climate adaptability and offers new income op- portunities for small farmers, enhancing rural livelihoods. Supportive measures, such as enhancing climate risk insurance through the PMFBY and offering affordable credit through programs such as Kisan Credit Card (KCC), can also enable farmers to adopt CRA practices without financial strain. Therefore, integrating these initia- tives into financial inclusion plans can reduce farmers’ vulnerability to extreme weather. Encouraging water-efficient technologies, like drip irrigation and systems such as MAR, aligns with India’s sustainable water use goals and the Jal Jeevan Mission (https://jaljeevanmission.go v.in/), can also boost agricultural output while conserving resources (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2021; Sarkar and Bharat, 2021).
