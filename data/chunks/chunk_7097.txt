The project includes four farm and two field based cooperating centres located in various ICAR Institutes and State Agriculture/Veterinary Universities. A total of 535 male and 192 female sheep of different breeds were sold for genetic improvement of farmer’s flock. Mega Sheep Seed Project (MSSP): The project has four cooperating units, viz. KVAFSU, Bidar for Mandya Sheep; TANUVAS, Chennai for Mecheri sheep; RAJUVAS, Bikaner for Sonadi sheep and ICAR-CSWRI, Avikanagar for Malpura sheep. The major objective of the project is improvement of indigenous sheep breeds by propagation of superior germplasm in the farmers’ flock by production and distribution/sale of 70 superior breeding rams to cover at least 2,500 breeding ewes of farmers annually by each unit. Goat Breed improvement in field conditions: Improved Jamunapari, Barbari, Jakhrana goats were supplied for genetic improvement of germplasm in farmers’ field. Jamunapari goat: The averages age at first service (AFS), weight at first kidding (WFK), age at first kidding (AFK) and gestation period (GP) were 760.45±44.39 days, 33.80±0.69 kg, 931.89±51.44 days and 152.87±3.60 days, respectively, which showed desirable and significant improvement in reproductive traits. The overall mean of milk yield in 90 days and 140 days was 75.38±1.84 and 111.46±2.99 litres, respectively with lactation length of 161.04±3.24 days. Barbari goat: The least squares means for average age at first service (AFS), weight at first service (WFS), weight at first kidding (WFK), age at first kidding (AFK), first kidding interval (FKI) and gestation period (GP) were 412.02±9.91 days, 21.28±0.39 kg, 23.83±0.46 kg, 560±10 days, 296.01±7.15 days and 146.10±0.42 days, respectively. Females born as multiples took more time to attain puberty, thus more AFS and AFK. Goats with >18 kg body weight at kidding delivered higher weight per kidding and multiple births. Overall mean for 90 days and 140 days milk yield was 60.75±0.85 and 82.55±1.29 litres respectively with lactation length of 134.87±1.82 days. Poultry Improvement of germplasm Rural poultry: The genetic and phenotypic response in 6-week shank length of PD-1 line was 2.53 and 1.
