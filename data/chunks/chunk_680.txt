 In the year 1992, agro- ecological units 4 to 8 were assigned to cover the semi- arid ecosystem, whereas agro-ecological units 4 to 9 represent the semi-arid ecosystem in the revised edition of AER. In the year 1992, agro-ecological units 9 to 13 represented sub- humid agro-ecosystem, whereas agro- ecological units 10 to 15 represent this region in the AER map of 2015. Agro-ecological units 14 to 17 were defined per humid agro-ecosystem in the year 1992, whereas in the revised AER map, agro-ecological units 16 to 18 cover this region. Agro-ecological unit 20 represented exclusively island agro-ecosystem in 1992, whereas in the revised edition, island agroecosystem is merged with the coastal agro-ecological units 19 and 20. Agro- ecological units 18 and 19 in the earlier map exclusively represented coastal agroecosystem. In the revised edition, the east and west coast of India are covered under agro-ecological units 19 and 20 respectively. The revised map of AER with a finer resolution dataset sharpens the extent and area of different ecosystems prevailing in the country. The areas under arid and semi-arid agro-ecosystems are revised from 53.2 to 45.0 and 116.4 to 145.3 million hectares respectively. Change in the area of arid agro-ecosystem is attributed to the development of water resources through irrigation projects, whereas scarcity of water to raise the second crop in the rainfed areas of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana is discernible from the area under delineated semi-arid agro-ecosystem. Similarly, the scarcity of water for raising the second crop in the states of Jharkhand, Bio-climate maps (1992 and 2015) of India Odisha, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra could be observed from the revision of extent and area in the sub-humid agro-ecosystem category from 105.7 to 89.6 million hectares. The changes have also been made in the extent and area of humid, per humid ecosystem Agro-ecological regions (Revised edition) Bioclimatic regions (1992) Revised bioclimate (2015) Indian Farming 16 June 2023 from 32.4 to 28.5 million hectares. On comparing the bio-climate type, a component of AER maps of 1992 and 2015, it is noted that, the area under hyper-arid category changed from 9.9 mha (3.0% of TGA) to 6.6 mha (2.0% of TGA) and the area under sub-humid moist category changed from 72.4 mha, (22.0 % of TGA) to 13.2 mha (4.0% of TGA). The revision also estimated an increase in the area under the semi-arid moist category from 78.9 mha (24.0% TGA) to 98.6 (30.0% of TGA) and sub- humid dry 42.8 mha, (13.0 % of TGA) to 78.9 mha (24.0% of TGA). Similarly, the area under the humid and per- humid categories is revised from 32.9 and 52.6 mha to 16.5 and 39.5 mha, respectively. The semi-arid (dry) areas have been modified from 26.3 mha to 49.4 mha.
