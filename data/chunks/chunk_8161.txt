 Ranking of agricultural universities: In line with the National Initiative on Ranking of Indian Institutions, Ranking of Agricultural Universities has been initiated with a larger objective to improve ranking of Indian Universities in World University Rankings. The ranking process is being done annually and top three universities are honoured on ICAR Foundation Day held on 16 July. It is expected that the process of ranking would help agricultural universities to self-assess themselves on the quality and enhance their abilities. While evaluating the agricultural universities, the emphasis has been given on parameters such as students’ performance, academic excellence, faculty profile, research product, research impact, research excellence, technologies transferred to farmers, spread/adoption of technologies and increase in agricultural growth in the area of jurisdiction of the university. Based on the evaluation, 63 agricultural universities were ranked and the top three universities, viz. First ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal; Second ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi; Third Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana, were honoured on ICAR Foundation Day Award Ceremony held on 16 July 2018.
