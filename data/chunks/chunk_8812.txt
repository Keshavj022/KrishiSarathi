DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 26 Crop Protection The root-rot disease in cowpea and berseem could be effectively controlled with neem cake at 1 tonne/ha and seed treatment with Trichoderma harzianum (fungi). SUCCESS STORY FORAGES ON BUNDS Broad farm-bunds occupy about 6-10% of the cultivated lands in Bundelkhand and in many other parts of the country for minimizing run-off losses. This was perceived by many farmers as a net loss in actual cultivated area. Utilization of such bunds through growing of forages in a participatory mode in some villages around Jhansi (Uttar Pradesh) and Dharwad (Karnataka) was undertaken. It was possible to apply participatory mode for judicious selection of tree and pasture species. The preference was for medium-height trees of fruit value, providing high and quick returns. Similarly, the choice was for a few pasture species; but Stylosanthes hamata was the unanimous choice.
