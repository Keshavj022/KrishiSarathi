 The shoots emerge from these bulbs within two or three months which Production of vegetables through organic sources of nutrient management: Application of FYM (25 t/ha) in green manure tomato–mung bean cropping system recorded 12.16% higher rice equivalent yield (REY) over inorganic system. In green manuring - vegetable pea–okra sequence combined application of FYM (10 t/ha) and NADEP compost (10 t/ha) increased yield by 10.14% over conventional system. The organic carbon content of the soil improved by 17.63 and 22.42%, respectively, with the application of NADEP compost and FYM (25 t/ha) over the inorganic system. The ascorbic acid, total phenol and anti-oxidant content increased by 18.2, 13.6 and 9.2% in cowpea and 21.8, 16.6 and 12.4% in okra over the inorganic system. Harnessing the synergistic benefits of interspecific grafting in solanum: The novel steonic combination obtained by inter-specific grafting of two solanaceous vegetables, i.e. potato (as rootstock) and tomato (as scion) is termed as Pomato. The innovative technology Backbulbs in Oncidium Backbulbs in Cymbidium can be potted in orchid compost. Cymbidium, Cattleya, Coelogyne and Oncidium are propagated through this method. In Cymbidium, it was observed that both saw dust and cocopeat are effective media for generation of plants through backbulbs. Germination takes place in 90–99 days during spring and 42–48 days during summer. Zygopetalum orchid based cropping system: In Zygopetalum based farming systems, 10 to 12 spikes of Zygopetalum/m2/year with 7 number of pseudobulbs/ plant, 3 number of spikes/plant having 70 cm spike length, 6.5 flowers/spike measuring 7.75 cm can be produced along with anthurium bearing 8 to 12 number of spikes/m2/season, 2 to 3 spikes/plant having 6.96 cm × 9.17 cm spathe size, 32–40 cm peduncle length, 0.5 cm × 6.15 cm spadix size. In bed culture of anthurium, a dose of 10–20 kg FYM/m2 was sufficient for production of quality flower with a vase life of 90 days. Glory lily (Gloriosa superba) Development of protocol for cost effective micro- tuber production: The protocol for cost effective multiplication of micro tubers from seeds of glory lily was standardised including pollination, maturity indices, grading, and methods to induce seed germination. The micro tubers evolved were advanced for two more generations and bulked to 40–45 g weight tested at farmers field. Results indicated that this technology is successful in reducing the tuber cost to as low as ` 1.25 lakh/ha as compared to ` 3.75 lakh/ha in conventional practice of using wild traded tubers. By using these microtubers evolved CROP MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2020 73 from this technology, nearly 20% increased seed yield could be obtained.
