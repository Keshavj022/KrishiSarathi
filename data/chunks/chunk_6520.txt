(https://CRAN.R- project.org/package=ResPBIBD) slr: Semi-Latin Rectangles-A facility to generate balanced and partially balanced semi-Latin rectangles with cell size two. An R package slr has been developed to implement the proposed methods of constructions of balanced and partially balanced semi-Latin rectangles. The package is available on CRAN in the webpage https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=slr. It comes with two main functions namely bslr(v) and pbslr(v) which can be used for constructioning balanced SLR and a partially balanced SLR, respectively, for given number of treatments (v). Tri.Hierarchical.IBDs: Tri- Hierarchical Incomplete Block Designs: It generates tri-hierarchical designs with six component designs under certain parameter restrictions. (Available at: https://CRAN.R-project.org/ package=Tri.Hierarchical.IBDs ). TSSVM Time Series Forecasting using SVM Model: SOCIAL SCIENCE Financial assistance management system for conference and journals (FAMSCG) FAMSCJ is an online workflow-based system managing for financial grants given by ICAR to scientific societies for: (a) organizing national/international conferences/ seminars/symposia; (b) publication of scientific journals, online application, approval process and tracking of application’s status by ICAR officials. The key-features of FAMSCJ are: (i) online financial assistance application (proposal) process, (ii) online application assessment process; (iii) online tracking of application’s status; (iv) automatic sanction letter generation process; (v) downloading of sanction letter by concerned Society and (vi) online submission of report by concerned society. FAMSCJ has been developed in collaboration with technical Coordination Unit of ICAR. The System was launched by Honorable Secretary DARE and Director General ICAR on 1 January, 2023.
