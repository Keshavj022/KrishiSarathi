 In input management, it is relatively more straightforward for the farmers to shift to organic agriculture in these rainfed crops compared to commercial crops. 3.6. Impact Assessment of PKVY at Farm Level When calculating the impact of organic agriculture, only three crops were consid- ered: wheat, paddy and soybean. All farmers did not grow all three crops. Hence, only farmers who grow these crops were included in this analysis. Among 2880 conventional farmers, only 1008 cultivated paddy, 691 cultivated wheat and 202 cultivated soybeans. Among 2880 organic farmers, 806 cultivated paddy, 518 cultivated wheat and 135 cultivated soybeans. Tables 2 and 3 present the tabular and regression analysis for the costs, gross revenue, proﬁts, yields and manure usage per hectare using the Difference-in-Difference approach. In the table, we are only interested in the Difference-in-Difference component (change in target variable due to adoption of organic agriculture after discounting for the initial differences recorded in the base year). For example, in the case of wheat, before the introduction of organic agriculture, the cost of controlled (conventional) farmers was Rs 40,008/ha (USD 615/ha), while for treatment farmers, it was Rs 40,059/ha (USD 616/ha). However, after the introduction of PKVY and once treatment farmers started adopting organic agriculture, the costs were raised to Rs 42, 752/ha (USD 657/ha) for organic farmers. At the same time, the costs of conventional farmers further grew to Rs 48, 202/ha (USD 741/ha). A similar analogy applies to other variables in the table.
