The fragile scab came off almost completely in groups A and B during dressing change-over, whereas in group C the central portion of almost all the wounds was seen still covered with this scab even after dressing change-over. The extent of inflammation and swelling was least in group C wounds and the animals of this group exhibited lesser pain reactions to palpation when compared with other two groups. The wound contraction (%) was significantly greater in group C when compared with other groups (Table 4). On day 14 after operation the wounds were seen covered with thick and strong scab in groups A and C (Fig. 2 A3 and C3). The margins of wounds of these groups showed complete healing of underlying tissue. The extent of healing was more widespread in group C wounds as evidenced by the presence of whitish new replacement tissue all around the wound margins, whereas in group A it was restricted mainly to one or two margins only. The extent of healing of underlying tissue was least in group B; its scab was also least firm at this stage (Fig. 2 B3). The inflammation and swelling at the wound margins were however absent in all the groups at this stage; but mild exudation was seen in some of the wounds of group B. The pain response to palpation in all the groups was also almost negligible. The wound contraction (%) was greatest in group C which was slightly greater than in group A and significantly greater than in group B wounds. On day 21, all the wounds irrespective of the group were devoid of any gross exudate and covered with dry and firm scab (Fig. 2 A4, B4 and Contents VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY C4).
