 are consumed as salad and thereby use of traditional synthetic insecticides may cause health hazards. Using different biocontrol agents would be a safer and cheaper option. Biological control can be defined as ‘the action of parasites, predators or pathogens in maintaining another organism’s population density at a lower average than would occur in their absence’. All biological control techniques entail using live natural enemy populations to either permanently or temporarily lower pest population densities while actively involving humans. Biological control of pests is a method of controlling pests (including insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases) that relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory, or other natural mechanisms. It can be an important component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs. Modern insect pests control highly rely upon chemical interventions resulting in many associated problems like resistance, resurgence, secondary outbreak of minor pests in addition to these environmental hazards. Therefore, utilization of biocontrol agents which are target specific, ecofriendly with self-perpetuating capacity is an alternate viable option for the pest management practices. Types of biocontrol agents Predators: Predators are large, free-living organisms that consume a number of preys during their life cycle. They are not generally specific to a particular species for their feeding. Eg. Lady bird beetle, green lace wing, rove beetle, spiders etc. Parasitoids: These insects unlike predators complete their development in a single host whereas the adults are free-living. They generally attack the host larger than their size. The parasitoids that are having high host searching ability and high target and stage specificity can be used as a good biocontrol agent. Trichogramma sp are widely used egg parasitoid, similarly, Bracon sp. as larval parasitoid and Trichospilus pupivora as pupal parasitoid. Pathogens: These are the microscopic parasitic organisms that are causing disease to the insects. These includes bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis, B. popillae), virus (Nuclear polyhedrosis virus, Granulosis virus), fungi (Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae, Lecanicillium (=Verticillium) lecanii, Nomuraea rileyi), nematode (Steinernema). Types of biological control Broadly biological control can be classified into major types as: Research Jaydeep Halder*, P A Divekar, Singh Majumder and Kuldeep Srivastava Indian Horticulture 100 yy Classical biological control yy Augmentative biological control yy Conservational biological control Classical biological control In classical biological control, a natural enemy (NE) is introduced into a new area where they did not originate or do not occur naturally. This occurs specially when a pest is introduced in a new area without its natural enemy. This is generally done by Government agencies.
