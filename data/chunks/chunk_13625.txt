 Pearson correlation matrixes of both pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season (* Significant at α 0.1, ** significant at α 0.01, *** significant at α 0.001). R. Anjum et al. Chemical Engineering Journal Advances 16 (2023) 100547 11 Hospital (GW 10, 15, 11, 18, 4) displayed similarity in water quality. Unique water quality was observed at Patel Nagar and JNMC (GW 19, 16), respectively. 3.5. Water quality index results Water quality index was calculated and estimated based on the commonly used weightage given by their impact on human health [39, 52]. It is in general suggested to observe at least four parameters and in this study a total of fourteen parameters were considered out of whichSO4, TDS and pH were assigned with highest weightage of 0.1052 whereas total suspended solids, alkalinity, bicarbonate, chloride and sodium were assigned with the weightage of 0.0789 then finally least weight of 0.0526 was assigned for D.O, calcium, total hardness, EC and magnesium [39]. All sampling locations were classified into five classes based on WQI during both seasons. The tallied numbers of WQI range from 78.54 to 209.88 (PRM) and 78.39 to 179.98 (POM) respectively. The range of WQI was labeled at Table 5. In pre-monsoon season, 26.31% samples constitute for ‘very good’ water quality. Likewise, 52.63% shows ‘good water’ quality, 15.78% indicates ‘moderate’ and 5.26% indicates both ‘poor water’ and ‘very poor’ water quality respectively. Out of every category the best water quality was perceived at Soot Mill (78.54), V.R. apartment (107.22), Ambedkar Park (132.53), Patel Nagar (163.26) and Kali Deh (209.88) subsequently. Similar to the pre-monsoon season, during post-monsoon season again 26.31% samples signified as ‘very good’ water quality followed by 36.84% indicates ‘good water’ quality, 21.05% shows as ‘moderate’, 5.26% shows as ‘poor’ and 10.52% shows as ‘very poor’ water quality respectively. Among those groups, the finest water quality in each group was recognized at Malkhan Singh Hospital (78.39), Dodhpur chauraha (98.82), Gandhi eye hospital (120.85), Mulla para (144.947) and Kali deh (179.98) correspondingly. The city’s overall water quality improved during the POM season, with a maximum WQI of 179.98 collations compared to 209.88 during the PRM season. However, depended on the arithmetic mean category, the POM season displays more poor water quality than the compared season, with 73.68% good water quality being observed in the PRM season as opposed to 63.15% during the POM season. When compared to the PRM season (26.31%), the level of poor water quality amplified in the POM season (36.84%). This phenomenon might be brought on by contaminated surface water seeping below. Poor water quality was seen during the PRM season at the city’s highest point (Jama Masjid), Ambedkar Park, and Mulla Para. Fresh water does not percolate at such an altitude, and the location is also a Fig. 5. Piper plots of both pre and post-monsoon season. Fig. 6.
