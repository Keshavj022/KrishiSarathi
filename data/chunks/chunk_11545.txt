 Sugarcane: Use variety CO-86032 & intercrop with onion. Soil application of Azospirillum @ 10 kg / ha, PSB @ 10 kg /ha, Sett treatment (Carbendazim @ 100gm + Chloropyriphis @ 100ml + Urea @ 100 gm/100 litr). Use of pre-emergent weedicide Atrazine @ 1.6 kg/ha and post- emergent weedicide 2-4-D @ 2.5 kg/ha for weed management. Incorporation of straw. Tying & staking. Mulberry: White powdery patches appear on the lower surface of the leaves. The corresponding portions on the upper surface develop Chlorotic lesions, the leaves become yellow, coarse and loss their nutritive value. Spray wettable sulphur 50WP 2g/liter of water or Carbendazim @ 2g/liter of water. Safety period is 15 days. To manage Leaf Roller in mulberry, release Trichoderma chilonis egg parasitoids from 5th day after chemical spray @ 5 Trichocard per acre. Foliar spray of a multi mineral mixture Seriboost @ 2.5ml/liter of water. Dusting of lime every alternative day on silkworm @ 5g/square feet to manage Muscardine disease in silkworm. Tying of yellow sticky trap along with pheromone lure on every window inside and outside the rearing house to mitigate the Uzi fly infestation in Silkworm rearing. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 402 Onion: Bhima Dark Red, Bhima Shakti, Bhima Kiran, Bhima Light Red, Arka Nikitha, Arka Pragati, Arka Kirthiman, Arka Lalima and Arka Bheem are the red onions and Bhima Shubra, Bhima Shweta and Bhima Safed are the white onions varieties recommended for cultivation in rabi season. About 5-7 kg seeds are required to raise seedlings for one hectare. Application of pre-emergence herbicide pendimethalin @ 0.2% is recommended to control weeds in nursery. Seed treatment with thiram @ 2 g/kg of seed to avoid damage from damping off disease. Foliar spray of benomyl @ 0.2% is recommended to control soil borne diseases in the nursery. When the severity of thrips infestation is high, foliar application of Fipronil, or profenopos @ 0.1% is recommended. Seedlings are available for transplanting in 40-45 days after sowing (DAS) for Rabi season. For drip irrigation, the distance between two inbuilt emitters should be around 30-50 cm and the discharge flow rate should be 4 l/hr. For sprinkler, the distance between two laterals (20 mm) of micro sprinkler should be 6 m and with a discharge rate of 135 l/hr. Application of fertilizers @ NPK 40:40:60 kg /ha as basal and the remaining 70 kg N in seven splits through drip irrigation is recommended for achieving higher marketable bulb yield. Split doses should be applied at weekly interval from transplanting to 60 DAT Application of 0.2% Oxyflurofen 23.5 % EC before planting + one hand weeding at 40-60 days after transplanting is recommended for marketable bulb yield and weed control efficiency (65-80%). Combined application of 110:40:60:20 kg NPKS along with organic manures equivalent to 15 t FYM and Azospirillum and Phosphorus solubilizing bacteria @ 5 kg each/ha.
