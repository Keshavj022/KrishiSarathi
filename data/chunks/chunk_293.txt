The present endeavour will help the land use planners to make decision on alternate land use options at farm level for each land parcel (at 1: 4,000 scale) (Table 2). Implementation of land use planning programme Land use plan has been implemented in the study area by providing necessary agricultural and allied inputs to 250 beneficiary farm families of the village including vermicomposting units (25 farm families), multi-tier horticultural units (25 farm families), pre-kharif and rabi crop planning (providing improved variety seeds to 82 farm families), livestock components (100 farm families), fishery (25 farm families) and horticultural plantation programme (plant saplings of sub tropical fruits to 250 farm families). Horticultural plantation programme Horticultural plantation programme bestows both short term and long term benefits to farmers. The short term benefits lies in multi- tier horticultural units, whereas, for long term benefits, farmers will get a secured annual income from sub-tropical fruit crops after 4-5 years of plantation on regular basis. Moreover, this will also enhance the livelihood security for the landless labours through formation of women self-help groups or beneficiary landless farming community in the village. INM approach through vermicomposting The vermicomposting beneficiaries have started producing vermicompost @ 4.0 quintal per unit (8ft × 4ft × 2ft pit size) annually. They have received net returns of ` 4,800-6,000 per unit by selling the same @ ` 12 per kg.
