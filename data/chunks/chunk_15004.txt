Underweight prevalence in children under 5 years of age in districts of India. Rajasthan and its 25 out of 32 districts (i.e., 78.1% districts of the state) come under very high vulnerability category. Further, 14 districts (each) in Gujarat (56%), Karnataka (51.9%) and Madhya Pradesh (31.1%), 13 districts in Uttar Pradesh (18.6%), 12 districts in Maharashtra (36.4%), 6 districts in Bihar (16.2%), 5 districts in Tamil Nadu (17.2%), 3 districts in Jharkhand (16.7%), and 2 districts in Andhra Pradesh (9.1%) also come very high vulnerability cate- gory. Fig. 4 shows the spatial distribution of underweight prevalence in children under 5 years of age in the various districts of India. The underweight prevalence is shown as four underweight cate- gories −5.8 −23.3% (lowest), 23.4 −32.5%, 32.6 −41.9%, 42 −66.9% (highest). Our analysis showed that 159 out of 640 districts (24.8%) in various state of India was under the highest prevalence category in the year 2015–16, while 168 districts (26.3%) had children un- derweight prevalence 32.6 −42.9%. The highest underweight preva- lence in children under ﬁve years of age were in most of the districts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Ut- tar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Karnataka ( Fig.
