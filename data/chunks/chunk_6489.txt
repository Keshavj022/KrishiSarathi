 Elevated temperature (eT) significantly impacted biomass and yield components and the magnitude of response of individual genotypes varied. The reduction of total biomass at eT ranged from nil (PLU-826) to 10% (PSRJ-95016), while an increase in vegetative biomass ranged from nil (IPU-094-1) to 15% (IPU-06-2). The reduction in seed weight was highest with PSRJ-95016 under eT conditions, while the presence of eCO2 reduced the impact of eT and IPU-06-2 recorded 14% higher seed yield than at ambient control. Among the selected four black gram genotypes, the vegetative biomass of IPU-094-1 was less impacted at eT, while the highest improvement with eT+eCO2 was recorded with PSRJ-95016 revealing that the presence of eCO2 promotes more vegetative growth in this genotype. The genotype IPU-06-2 responded positively to eCO2 for seed yield as it not only alleviated the ill effects of eT, but also registered a higher seed yield than aT. Though eCO2 improved the overall biomass of the genotypes, its ameliorative capacity was higher for yield and yield components of this C3 pulse crop. The harvest index varied significantly across the treatment conditions, with the greatest index was observed under eCO2 conditions, whereas the harvest index was affected only by temperature.

Understanding the spatially variable, species-specific, and complex effects of climate change is essential in developing an appropriate pest management strategy. The two dimensions of climate change, i.e. elevated temperature (eTemp.) and elevatedCO2 (eCO2) influence insect herbivores. In the present study, the growth and development of an invasive insect pest, fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda on maize at eCO2 and eTemp conditions using CO2 and Temperature Gradient Chambers (CTGC) was estimated. Dilution of bio- chemical constituents was noted with lower leaf nitrogen (9%–14%), higher carbon (3%–11%), higher C:N (18%– 26%), and higher tannins (13%) in maize foliage at eCO2+eTemp. levels. A significant influence on primary parameters of insects, viz.
