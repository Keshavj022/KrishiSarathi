 With loose groundnut shells, fuel consumption rate varied between 44 and 50 kg/ hr, and gas’s calorific value ranged between 900 and 1100 kcal/m3 after stabilization of the operation. The gasifier efficiency varied from 55 to 60%. When the gasifier was loaded with 133 kg groundnut-shell briquettes, system operated continuously for 3 hr. The flame temperature was found consistent, varying from 870° to 929°C. Every 4 kg of groundnut-shells replaced 1 litre of LDO (Light Diesel Oil) i.e. a saving of approximately Rs 13 per litre of LDO replaced. Payback period has been computed around 1,000 hr of operation. 100-kW Natural Draft Gasifier for Wood and Crop Residues Upscaled model of the CIAE Natural Draft Gasifier was refined to achieve a thermal output of 92,000 kcal/hr, and it was evaluated on wood chips and groundnut- shells. The flame temperature varied from 850 to 1090°C with wood chips and l Compared to rice straw and biogas spent slurry mixture, soybean straw and spent slurry mixture was found 22- 27% nutritionally more enriched. l Developed a family-size, solid state anaerobic digester for agro-residues. l Developed a biogas plant of 6 m3 capacity and of floating dome-type, suitable for high water-table regions. l Developed groundnut-shell-based Open-core Down Draft Gasifier. In this, every 4-kg groundnut-shells replaced 1 litre of LDO. l Upscaled model of the CIAE Natural Draft Gasifier refined to achieve a thermal output of 92,000 kcal/hr, and it was evaluated on wood chips and groundnut-shells. l Developed a simple electronic temperature controller for use on the natural convection solar dryers. l The solar-water heater for paddy parboiling compared to traditional paddy parboiling saved 50% coal requirements, besides lessening time for parboiling. l All blends of HSD fuel and ethanol tested for engine-fuel found with the similar power-producing capability as HSD fuel alone. 25.02.03/26.02.03 Groundnut-shells-based Open-core Gasifier. The fuel used for the system is dry groundnut- shells and groundnut-shell briquettes. In the system, every 4 kg of groundnut-shells replaced 1 litre of light diesel oil AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY 147 from 810 to 1021°C with groundnut-shells. The calorific value of the gas generated ranged between 980 and 1,276 kcal/m3 with wood chips. The biomass consumption was recorded at 38–43 kg/hr and at 19–22 kg/hr for wood chips and groundnut- shells. The temperature profile of the gasifier was 1,238–1348°C and 1080–1232°C near the grate for wood and groundnut-shells. The present gasifier has faced problems of fly-ash moving along with the producer gas and of falling of partially burnt groundnut-shells from the grate. Agro-industrial Application of Gasifier Performance of the modified CIAE Portable Updraft Gasifier (25-kW capacity), installed at the menthol-oil-extraction plant, situated at village Khajuri in Bhopal, was monitored.
