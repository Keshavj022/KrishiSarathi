41%) CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 27 OILSEEDS G R O U N D N U T Crop Improvement An early-maturing (107 days), Spanish groundnut variety VG 9521 has been released for Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and southern Maharashtra for kharif. VRI(Gn)5 for kharif and Co(Gn)4 for kharif and rabi/summer seasons have been released for Tamil Nadu. PBS 24004 (tolerant to iron-deficiency chlorosis), PBS 30008 (narrow leaf mutant) and PBS 30017 (lemon yellow leaf mutant) have been registered with the NBPGR. Crop Production The epicuticular wax load (EWL) on leaf increased significantly with increase in plant age, and this increase was more pronounced in the crop subjected to protracted moisture deficit stress. Hence, EWL can possibly be used as a selection criterion for drought tolerance. ICGS 44 withstood membrane injury due to high temperature and water deficit. This genotype would be promising in breeding for resistance to high temperature. Pigeonpea ICPL 87 was found best for groundnut intercropping at Jalgaon and BDN 2 at Junagadh with higher net returns. Groundnut+pigeonpea intercropping improved organic carbon content (0.41%), maintained higher available nitrogen (60 ppm) and enhanced activities of free nitrogen-fixing microbes in the soil (50.5×104 colony forming units per g of soil) as compared to sole groundnut, in which organic carbon content was 0.38%, nitrogen content was 56 ppm and N2-fixing microbes population was 5.1×104. Crop Protection Seven advanced breeding lines ICGVs 93197, 92012, 91153, 92195, 92022, ALG 75 and VG 9711 have been found highly resistant to late leaf spot in natural and artificially inoculated conditions. Mustard cake (50%) aqueous extract, obtained after soaking for 16 hr, inhibited spore germination of late leaf-spot and rust pathogen. Groundnut with pearl millet (3:1) + foliar spray of aqueous extract of mustard cake at 5% at 55 DAS significantly reduced intensity of early and late leaf spot diseases. For controlling late leaf spot and rust, one row of pigeonpea for every 3 of groundnut and one foliar spray of neem seed kernel extract (5% concentration) at 55 days after sowing have been found promising. This gave a cost : benefit ratio of 1 : 5 at Jalgaon. RAPESEED-MUSTARD Crop Improvement Gobhi sarson (Brassica napus) TERI (OE) RO3 (TERI UNNAT), with low erucic acid (< 2%), has been identified for release. This also has high oleic acid (59.5%) with average yield of 1,113 kg/ha and its oil content is 41%. It matures in 134 days (9 days earlier than GSL a national check). Karan rai (Brassica napus) JTC 1 has been identified for rainfed areas. It gives a mean yield of 1,419 kg/ha and matures in 165 days. And another PC 5-17 has been recommended for rainfed and irrigated agro-ecologies with an average yield of 1,725 kg/ha in irrigated areas and of 1,515 kg/ha in rainfed area, besides oil content of 39.4%.
