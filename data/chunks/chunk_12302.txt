 Introduction State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 2 The present volume is a summary document developed from the detailed state specific documents and includes in brief the approaches, major strategies and technology interventions included to be implemented in different states at times supported by few case studies/ success stories. The strategies in the document focus on increased emphasis on agri-business through transforming farming into agri-enterprises performing multiple functions at one point of time.
