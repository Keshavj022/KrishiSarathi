 Oil content is 41% CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 35 Crop Production At Powerkheda, sowing double-purpose linseed during last week of October, using 45 kg of seeds/ha was observed the best practice to harvest higher seed yield. At Mauranipur, double-purpose linseed sowing with 25% higher seed rate (56–57 kg/ha) during first week of November was adjudged as the best treatment for good net monetary returns. At Nagpur, broadcasting linseed at 40 kg of seed/ha at dough stage of paddy proved a superior practice for the crop sequence. In linseed + safflower (4 : 2) intercropping, fertilizer at 100% RDF to main crop and 50% to intercrop recorded highest linseed equivalent yield at Sagar in rainfed situations. In linseed + wheat (4 : 2) intercropping system, fertilizer at 100% RDF to both the crops and in linseed + mustard, fertilizer at 100% RDF to main crop and 50% to intercrop proved optimum in Himachal Pradesh. Crop Protection Linseed intercropped with chickpea (3 : 1) at recommended fertilizer and irrigation schedules, bird perches at 40–50 pegs/ha and need-based Imidacloprid 200 SL (100 m/ha) at Kanpur, Dimethoate 30 EC (0.03%) at Raipur and Oxydemeton methyl 25 EC (0.02%) at Faizabad provided maximum seed yield with higher net monetary returns as well as benefit: cost ratio. Linseed lines A 95 b, EC 1392, EC 1424, GS 234 and JRF 5 proved promising against bud-fly. PULSES CHICKPEA Crop Improvement JKG 92337 is a semi-spreading kabuli chickpea variety from a three-way cross (ICCV 2 × Surutato) × ICC 7344, and has been identified for Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, southern Rajasthan and Bundelkhand area of l Noticed an extra-early genotype of chickpea; amenable for planting up to December end. l Kabuli chickpea BG 1003 intercropped with mustard Vardan in 6 : 2 ratio found most productive and remunerative system with benefit: cost ratio of 4 : 1. l Chickpea promising donors identified for resistance to Fusarium wilt. l Trichoderma viride at 4 g + vitavax at 1 g/kg chickpea seeds controlled Fusarium wilt and root-rot. JKG 92337 kabuli chickpea possesses moderate resistance against collar rot and Fusarium wilt. Its average seed yield is 1.7 tonnes/ha (inset : its seeds) DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 36 Uttar Pradesh. Besides being early-maturing, this variety possesses moderate resistance against collar rot and Fusarium wilt. Its average seed yield is about 1.7 tonnes/ha. And Phule G 9531, a bold-seeded (35g/100 seeds) kabuli selection, from the cross (ICCC 32 × ICCL 8004) × (ICCC 49 × FLIP 82-8C) × ICCV 3), has been identified for Orissa, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. It is an early- maturing (90 days), Fusarium-wilt resistant variety with an average yield of 1.8 tonnes/ha. Five elite lines, IPC 98-12, IPC 97-67, IPC 98-53, IPC 97-7 (desi) and IPCK 98- 18 (kabuli), have showed promise in the advanced trials, and IPC 94-94 has been found an extra-early genotype, amenable for planting up to December end.
