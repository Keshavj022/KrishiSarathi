 The major enterprises included were mushroom cultivation, vermi-compost production, nutritional gardens, processing of fruits and vegetables etc. Refinement: Total 225 technological interventions were refined across 254 locations by laying out 1,215 trials in the farmers’ fields under various thematic areas, viz. cropping systems, farm machineries, integrated crop management, integrated disease management, integrated farming system, integrated nutrient management, integrated pest management, integrated weed management, processing and value addition, resource conservation technologies and storage techniques. The major crops included cereals, pulses, oilseeds, fruits and vegetables. Besides, 25 technological interventions at 32 locations were also refined through 323 trials on livestock, poultry and fisheries enterprises under the thematic areas, viz. disease management, feed and fodder management, nutrition management and production and management. The major livestock enterprises included were cows, buffaloes, poultry birds, sheep, goats, and fisheries. In addition, seven women specific income generating technologies were also refined by conducting 85 trials in 10 locations under the thematic areas, viz. drudgery reduction, health and nutrition, processing and value addition. Frontline demonstrations During the reported period, 129,678 demonstrations covering an area of 42,145 ha were organized to demonstrate the production potential of the newly released improved varieties/production technologies in crops/animal husbandry and other agricultural enterprises. Of these 117,659 (90.73%) demonstrations covering an area of 40,906 ha were on cereals, millets, oilseeds, pulses, commercial crops, fiber crops, spices, medicinal plants, plantation crops, fodder crops, horticultural crops etc. 14. Technology Assessment, Demonstration and Capacity Development Technology assessment, refinement and demonstration DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 122 TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, DEMONSTRATION AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 123 Cereals: A total of 25,285 demonstrations covering an area of 9,666 ha were organized on rice, wheat, maize, barley etc. The yield increase of about 30% was observed in the demonstration plots over the farmers’ practice. The average yield advantages for these crops were 30, 25, 35 and 28%, respectively. Millets: A total of 3,115 demonstrations in an area of 1,114 ha were organized to show the production potential of millet crops, viz. sorghum, barnyard millet, finger millet, pearl millet etc. The average yield advantages for these crops were 36, 35, 26 and 41%, respectively. Oilseeds: During the reported year, 22,804 demonstrations were conducted in oilseed crops, which included groundnut, sesame, soybean, castor, linseed, niger etc. in about 9,704 ha. The average yield advantage was 35, 40, 44,19, 51 and 38%, respectively.
