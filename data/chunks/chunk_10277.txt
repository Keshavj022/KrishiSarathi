 For ex-situ conservation, semen doses and somatic cells are being cryo- conserved at National Gene Bank, NBAGR, Karnal and so far, semen doses of 24 breeds of cattle (163108), 12 breeds of buffalo (59,703), 5 breeds of goat (12584), one breed each of sheep (8375) and camel (928), 3 breeds of equine (1750) and a breed of yak (460), totaling to 227362 semen doses of 47 livestock breeds have been cryo-conserved. So far, 180 breeds of livestock (cattle 50, buffalo 19, goat 34, sheep 44, pig 10, horses/ ponies 7, donkey 3, camel 9, yak 1, dog 3) and 22 poultry (chicken 19, duck 2, geese 1 ) have been gazette notified. Most remarkable achievement was revival of Krishna Valley cattle in Maharashtra and Karnataka states. The number of this cattle breed was reduced to only 400 when NBAGR initiated an in- situ conservation program and after 12 years of continuous efforts the number has increased to 10,000.

Cattle The crossbreeding of indigenous cattle breeds with exotic cattle breeds like Holstein Friesian, Jersey, Brown-Swiss was started in India as early as 1875. Subsequently, it was expanded into AICRP on cattle with five centers viz. IVRI, Izatnagar and CCS, Haryana used Hariana cattle; MPKVV, Rahuri and JNKVV Jabalpur used Gir; ANGRAU, Lam used Ongole as base foundation for crossbreeding programme. Karan Swiss and Karan Fries were developed at NDRI, Karnal, and Sunandini (Non-descript x Brown Swiss) was developed under Indo-Swiss project at Kerala. The prestigious “Frieswal Project” launched on 23rd May 1985 by ICAR in collaboration with Military Farms with the objective to evolve a national milch cattle breed having 4000 kg milk with 4% butter-fat in a mature lactation of 300 days. The outcome of project was a stable cross “Frieswal” with 62.5% (HF) and 37.5% (Sahiwal) inheritance. IVRI, Izatnagar developed Vrindawani (Hariana x Brown Swiss x Jersey). Performance profiles of four crossbreds have been summarized in Table 3. Table 3.
