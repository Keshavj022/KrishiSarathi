Experiment: The field experiment was repeated in Coimbtore and Banglore.The results are presented in Tables 2. In both the cases results showed that endosulfan at 0.07% was effective against fruit borer. Cynodon extract spray was not effective compared with endosulfan treatment. But the pooled results indicate that there was some reduction of fruit-borer incidence due to spraying of Cynodon dactylon extract. In disease management (Table 3) Cynodon dactylon extract was little effective in the management of wilt, leaf curl and fruit-root disease. The component of Cynodon extract did not show anti-fungal activity in the TLC bioassy carried out in the laboratory. But it had shown reduction of disease compared with uncontrolled chamber. CONCLUSION Cynodon dactylon extract was not effective compared with 0.05% endosulfan spray in controlling fruit borer. But Cynodon had some effect in reducing the fruit-borer-incidence. In disease management against wilt, leaf curl and early blight, Cynodon dactylon extract showed reduction compared with untreated control.
