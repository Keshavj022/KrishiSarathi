KVK, Jorhat had selected Hampshire, an improved breed as a need based intervention for solving the problem with indigenous low productive breed. To meet the requirement of improve piglets of the new improved breed, one breeding unit was established in each of the 10 selected villages with 10 female pigs and two boars.
