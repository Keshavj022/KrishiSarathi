Important diseases The important diseases observed in cucurbit crops under diara land cultivation are downy mildew, gummy stem blight, powdery mildew and viral diseases. Management yy Crop should be grown with wide spacing. The air movement and sunlight exposure helps in checking the disease initiation and development for management of downy mildew. yy Gummy stem can be managed by using healthy seeds, and quick decomposing of plant debris. Important Insects-pests The insects like aphids, mites, white flies, root knot nematode and red pumpkin beetle are usually noted in early stages of crops. The fruit-fly incidence is more in pointed gourd and bitter gourd and mite infestation increases in arid situations, as the day temperature rises above 40°C. March–April 2023 81 yy Integrated management practices, i.e. avoidance of source of infection, control of vectors, modification of cultural practices and resistance of host plant. Mineral deficiencies Non-pathogenic diseases mostly caused by mineral deficiencies are also prevalent in some situations. This is a special problem in river-beds. Absence of rich sub-soil, silt or alluvium beneath the sandy layer and leaching of nutrients due to sandy substrate sometimes cause deficiencies of macro and micro-nutrients. Harvesting and marketing The melon fruits come to the market in February- March in Andhra Pradesh, slightly later in April in Maharashtra and Rajasthan, extending to June in West Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Other cucurbits come earlier because they are picked in edible (vegetable) maturity stage, like bottle gourd in March. The pumpkin is the last to arrive in the market, since it is of longer duration.
