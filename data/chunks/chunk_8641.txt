 The blanching for 10 minutes was done at 15 psi or 1 atmosphere and for 40 min through open-boiling at 100°C. AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY 143 during extended storage. No chemical proved better over control for higher TSS and reducing sugar retention in storage (up to 9 days) Enhancement of Shelf-life of Ber For room storage of ber, polyethylene bags and waxing of fruits should be preferred to minimize decay losses (24.31%) after 9 days of storage. Gunny bags were best packaging material for zero-energy cool chamber storage, as it minimized decay losses (16.91 and 17.22%) in waxed and unwaxed fruits in 9 days of storage. Storage of ber was not economical beyond 9 days. l Recovery of dal from pigeonpea enhanced in milling with the application of 4% CIRCOT enzyme. l Antinutritional factor, phytic acid, reduced from soybean seeds artificially inoculated with Rhizopus oligosporous and Aspergillus oryzae, and blanching them for 10 and 40 minutes. l Okara, by-product of soymilk, found suitable for making high fibre nutritious soy-cereal snacks with rice, wheat, maize, jowar and bajra. l Technology for jaggery-chocolate production standardized. l Plastic and stainless steel pots proved promising for storing rabs (liquid jaggery). OKARA FORTIFIED SOY-CEREAL SNACKS USING WENGER EXTRUDER Okara is a by-product of soymilk process. From 1 kg of soybean about 1.1 kg of okara is obtained, having 75–78% moisture. On the dry basis, soy okara contains 22% protein, 10% fat, 27.5% carbohydrates, 34.5% insoluble fibres and 3.5% ash, and hence is suitable for making high-fibre nutritious soy-cereals-based snacks. Okara was added to rice, wheat, maize, jowar and bajra at 6, 14,and 18% fortification level. The highest expansion was obtained when okara was fortified with jowar, followed by wheat and rice. PROBLEM AREAS IN KHANDSARI UNITS The major problems in khandsari (sugar) industry include poor juice recovery, open- pan system of manufacturing, crushing, inversion losses due to uncontrolled heating and lack of mechanization of different unit operations. The total losses of sugarcane in khandsari mill with open- pan system ranged from 3.7 to 6.2% and with vacuum-pan system losses were only from 1.65 to 2.9%. The study suggested use of vacuum-pan system, mechani- zation of various operations, improvement in juice recovery through imbibition system, and crop management through varietal schedule.
