 The GC-C-IRMS response showed a linear increase in peak intensities with concentration, reaching a plateau in carbon isotope composition (Fig. 2). Injection with less than 5 ng of C on-column resulted in inconsistent δ13C values, with reduced precision (> 2.5 ‰), reproduc­ ibility (SD = 1.0 ‰), and accuracy (Δ(13C)EA-GC > 2 ‰). Optimal per­ formance was achieved with injections between 8 and 42 ng C, corresponding to profenofos concentrations of 11–56 mg.L−1. Within this range, δ13C values obtained using GC-IRMS (− 22.9 ± 0.3 ‰; Table 1 Profenofos dissipation kinetics (T1/2) and isotope fractionation (εC) parameters derived from laboratory experiments (n.s = non-significant).

The total uncertainty of carbon isotopic measurements, including precision, accuracy, and reproducibility, was ± 0.3 ‰ (n = 3). The extraction procedures for profenofos from water or soil samples had minimal impact on δ13C values, with deviations (Δδ13C) of less than 0.7 ‰ for water extractions and less than 1 ‰ for soil extractions (Table S-3). The primary isotope source, the commercial formulation ROCKET 44, had a slightly different δ13C value (−23.8 ± 0.3 ‰; n = 6) compared to analytical standards, consistent with previous observations for other pesticides [41]. Overall, the validation assay results confirmed the suitability of the profenofos CSIA method for the monitoring dissipation processes in both laboratory and field experiments. 3.2. Kinetics of profenofos dissipation in laboratory experiments The primary abiotic dissipation processes of profenofos in aqueous environments, including volatilisation, hydrolysis, and photolysis, were systematically quantified through dedicated laboratory experiments. Profenofos dissipation processes were characterized by varying half- lives (T1/2) and carbon isotopic fractionation (εC) (Table 1). 3.2.1.
