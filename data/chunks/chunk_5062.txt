Significant (p > 1.10 level of significance) decline in aphid population was observed after day 10 for all the concentrations of aged buffalo urine treatments. Initial upsurge in aphid population may be due to the presence of more resistant adult stages, which subsequently added to the aphid population. The higher concentration, particularly 30% and 100% aged buffalo urine, were most effective in eradicating the aphid. The full control of aphid population was achieved after day 25 in all the urine treatments. The control of aphid population with higher concentration was achieved as early as after day 20 in concentration >30%. The decline in effectiveness of these urine concentrations of higher dilution may probably be due to overdilution of certain insecticidal constituents of urine. Comparative effect of different concentrations of fresh buffalo urine spray on aphid population and growth of cabbage The results of this experiment are given in Tables 5 and 6 and Fig. 5. The cabbage in control treatment initially showed a continuous increase Fig. 5.
