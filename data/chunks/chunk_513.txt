 Incorporating a wide range of vegetables into the diet provides an abundance of bioactive compounds that can collectively contribute to a healthier lifestyle and reduce risk of chronic diseases. The primary global challenge confronting humanity and the planet is acknowledged to be climate change, which significantly affects the cultivation of vegetables and agriculture as a whole. Vegetables are particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, posing a threat to food security. Since vegetables are a primary source of essential nutrients for human diet, the negative impacts on their production can threaten global food security and exacerbate malnutrition. It is imperative to concentrate on a comprehensive strategy that involves the creation of climate-resistant vegetable varieties, sustainable farming methods, the incorporation of biotechnological advancements and more in order to alleviate the adverse effects of climate change on vegetable production. Keywords: Climate change, Food security, Global Warming, Nutrition, Vegetables Indian Farming 73 (09): 25-28; September 2023 I n the present global context, vegetables have become indispensable in guaranteeing sufficient nourishment and ensuring food stability. India has emerged as a significant player in vegetable production, with a staggering output of 204.83 million metric tonnes from an area spanning 11.35 million hectares in 2022–23. Based on the 2021 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), India is recognized as the leading cultivator of okra and ginger, surpassing all other vegetables in production. Additionally, India secures second in producing onion, potato, cabbage, cauliflower, and brinjal. Moreover, India also stands as the world’s second-largest producer of vegetables, contributing approximately 15% of global production. However, cultivating vegetables is highly susceptible to adverse environmental conditions, making them vulnerable to high temperatures and limited soil moisture. These factors act as significant deterrents to achieving high yields and the impacts of climate change further compound the situation. Climate change is recognized as the foremost global challenge facing humanity and the earth, and has profound consequences on vegetable cultivation and agriculture as a whole. This, in turn may inevitably affect worldwide food security. The impacts of climate change, specifically in tropical regions where developing countries are situated, exhibit greater significance and endure lasting consequences. These countries face the brunt of the adverse impacts over an extended period, exacerbating the challenges encountered in their agricultural practices and food production systems. India plays a significant role in vegetable production, but climate change threatens this industry. Global warming, erratic rainfall and extreme weather events are affecting vegetable cultivation worldwide. These unprecedented changes create significant challenges for farmers.
