Equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of unwrapped jaggery-chocolate stored at room temperature was more than wrapped samples at different relative humidities. Wrapped chocolate could be stored at higher temperature and even at higher relative humidity. Preservation of Rab (Liquid Jaggery) The plastic and stainless steel-pots have showed their suitability for storing rabs. Citric acid (0.04%) and potassium meta bi-sulphite (0.1%) helped in preventing inversion, bacterial growth and also crystallization. Jaggery-based Extruded Product Raw materials for jaggery-based extruded products are wheat-flour and broken rice-flour. The flours were roasted separately and added to melted jaggery. This paste was extruded through 3-mm-size orifice of extruder, oven-dried at 60°C, packed DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 144 ECONOMICS OF PILOT PLANT FOR SOY-BASED ICE-CREAM Four pilot plant equipments, pasteurization tank, homogenizer, refrigerated ageing tank and softy ice-cream machine were procured to produce 100-litre soy ice-cream per day. Experiments were conducted by replacement of milk with 100% soymilk in common ice-cream to compare it with a commercial ice-cream plant. Hundred per cent soymilk ice-cream was found inferior in quality compared to commercial dairy milk ice- cream. However, when compared with ice-cream of 100% over-run, as obtained by commercial plant, the ice-cream from the pilot plant with 60% over-run was more acceptable. The working capital investment was Rs 287,925 for 100 litres per day capacity plant. The cost of production per litre and net profit were Rs 25.40 and Rs 1,180,800. The break even point was 33 days/5,209 litres. l To prepare grey-cotton fabric for dyeing, plasma treatment, developed at the CIRCOT, can substitute fully or partially the conventional wet chemical process. l Developed a new bio-chemical scouring technique for cotton and P/C blended fabrics. This process can be coupled with Hand-processing unit, and can reduce pollution by 25% and save 30% in energy needs. and subjected to sensory evaluation. The product obtained from broken rice-flour and wheat-flour and jaggery in 1 : 2 : 0.25 attained the highest score on 9-point hedonic scale, and was most liked due to texture, taste, appearance and overall acceptance. COTTON TECHNOLOGY Eco-friendly and Cost-effective Means to Strengthen Cotton-Yarn Cotton-yarn wetting brings about many changes in its properties. A recent investigation conducted at the CIRCOT has revealed that subsequent to swelling in water if the yarn is stretched and dried in taut state (referred to as treatment), permanent structural transformations could be brought about. This increases yarn strength by 20% and brings about considerable improvement in various moduli values, making it more “elastic”.
