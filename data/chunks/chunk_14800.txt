 Miss applying some laws and regulations in favor of women such heritage legislation (Roshan Lal and Ashok Khurana, 2011) OBSTACLES TO WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN EXTENSION AND TRAINING: Some of the obstacles to women's extremely low access to extension and training are: Lack of knowledge of women's contributions to agricultural pro- duction Extension priorities Agricultural research priorities Attitudes and assumptions Practical constraints Lack of female extensionists Lack of appropriate extension training materials Lack of giving much more time 42/ Women Empowerment & Economic Development ANALYZE THE GENDER DIFFERENCES IN ROLES AND ACTIVITIES IN AGRICULTURE SECTOR Another issue is the problem-ridden conceptualization of women's and men's work in rural environments. Analysis of the gender division of labor has revealed that women typically take on three types of roles in terms of the paid and unpaid labor they undertake. These three roles can be described as follows 1. The productive role: The productive role means to generate income undertaken by women from market production and home! subsistence production. 2.The reproductive role: This refers to the child bearing and child-rearing responsibilities borne by women (which are essential to the reproduction of the workforce). 3.The community management role: This refers to activities undertaken by women to ensure the provision of resources at the community level, as an extension of their reproductive role. Recognition of gender roles and the specific needs of both men and women are key to effective and productive rice farming. Gender roles are partly the result of local ecosystems and farming practices, and can change over time. For example, in Eastern India, while women from the middle and lower castes work not only in their own rice fields but also as wage laborers on other people's farms, upper caste women do not usually work in rice farming at all (see Table 4). However, recent male outmigration for non-farm employment is forcing some women from poorer, upper-caste families to work in their own fields, thus breaking longstanding social norms.
