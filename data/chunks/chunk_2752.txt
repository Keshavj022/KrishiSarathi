 Why that was not acknowledge in 'Current Science' paper on BNLA 60 Ievent? The crylAc gene construct was received form NRCPB, New Delhi 51. Where, when and by whom the work of transfer of BNLA 60 I event to genotypes other than BN was undertaken? Transfer of BNLA601 event was intiated from 2005-06 at CICR, Nagpur under the supervision of Dr(Smt) Sumanbala Singh. Similarly same activity was initiated at VAS, Dharwad during 2006-07 under the supervision of Dr I.S.Katageri. 52. What is the fate ofabove materials? & 53. So, those are also positive for MaN 531? About 587 plants of BN Bt tested during 2009 were found Mon53! positive. As the same material was used in back c~ss breeding programme, all tbe material generated seems to be Mon 531 positive. 54. It is stated in a meeting held under chairmanship of DOG (CS) on May 21, 2008 that "The chairman pointed out that Dr Kranthi was an entomologist and therefore the results should not be taken seriously. He also asked Dr Kranthi not to carry out any further molecular testing of the samples and only to carry forward the commercialization process with full zeal, adhering to all instructions laid out in the proceeding" Dr Khadi, you attended this meeting? What do you remember about this meeting? Yes Sir, No Such statements were made by DDG(CS), The road map for commercialisation of BN Bt was discussed in the meeting. Other collegues: You also attended this meeting, what do you remember about this meeting? To the best of our knowledge and remembrance, no such statements were made by DDG(CS), ICAR, New Delhi in that meeting. 55. Dr Khadi, you said that you did not get any information on the presence of MaN 531 event in your material, i.e., BN Bt before the meeting held on Dec 10,2009. Your comment on the light of above statement in the meeting held on May 21, 2008. If I remember correctly, I came to know about contamination 2-3 months before the Dec, 2009 meeting called by DDG(CS). 56. Did Dr Kranthi mention in that meeting about the problem of presence ofMaN 531 in BNBt? Presence of Mon 531 in BN Bt was mentioned in the Dec:, 2009 meeting by Dr Kranthi 57. How was the performance ofBN Bt in seed production plots? Performance of BN Bt in seed prodnction plots at different research stations of UAS, Dharwad was satisfactory. 58. Was the seed production suspended due to segregation or presence ofMaN 531? In the meeting held on 10-12-2009 at NRCB, New Delhi under the chairmanship of DDG(CS), the seed production of BN Bt was suspended due to the presence of Mon 531. 59. Did you visit the seed production plots ofMAHABEEJ? What was the report about segregation? Please make available the reports submitted to UAS/CICR. A team of Scientists constituted by UAS, Dharwad along with Scientists of CICR, Nagpur visited and submitted detailed report(copy of report endosed) 60.
