 Moreover, CRA can provide access to knowledge and technology by providing training and extension services that equip smallholders with climate-smart practices and risk mitigation technologies, such as mobile applications, UAVs, IoT, and precision agriculture tools for weather forecasting and farm management (Nanjappan, 2018; Simelton et al., 2021). Social equity is also emphasized through policies targeting marginalized groups, including women and landless laborers, to ensure access to land rights, financial resources, and participation in decision-making processes (Huyer et al., 2021). Based on the delineated solutions, CRA is expected to enhance the resilience of India’s smallholder farmers, enabling them to adapt to climate change, improve their livelihoods, and promote sustainable practices. 7. Elements and conditions of resilience In this section, we explain the site-specific factors and critical ele- ments of CRA that enhance the resilience of agricultural systems, providing detailed insights into how each component contributes to sustainable and adaptive farming practices. 7.1. Site-specific conditions of CRA Singh et al. (2021) identified the West Coast Plains, Ghats, and Gangetic Plains as regions exhibiting the highest resilience to climatic threats. In contrast, the Middle Gangetic Plains, Eastern Hills, Plateau, and Western Dry regions were noted as less resilient. The Gangetic Plains experience significant fluctuations in annual precipitation and greenhouse gas emissions from crops. Due to deforestation and dimin- ished water storage, environmental resilience was found to be lowest in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. Conversely, states in the southern re- gion, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Odisha, demonstrated relatively better adaptation to climate-related challenges. In contrast, areas such as Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Bihar exhibited the lowest resilience to climatic shocks (Tolani et al., 2024). Climate-smart agriculture is particularly relevant in India due to the agriculture sector’s vulnerability and its role in the national economy (Kumar et al., 2018; Aryal et al., 2020). Farmers in Odisha have responded to natural calamities such as heatwaves, floods, cyclones, and droughts by adjusting planting dates and concentrating efforts on the rabi season rather than the Kharif season (Samaddar et al., 2024). Similarly, farmers in coastal regions of India employ the “land holiday” strategy, leaving their farms uncultivated to safeguard land resources from the impacts of droughts (Bahinipati and Venkatachalam, 2015). This strategy, aimed at protecting farms from severe weather events, involves altering planting dates in response to weather variations, often as a self-adaptive measure to changes brought about by the monsoon season. This method is similarly employed in Punjab to accelerate crop maturity and reduce groundwater usage (Ojha et al., 2014).
