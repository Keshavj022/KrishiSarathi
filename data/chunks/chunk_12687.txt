 Tamil Nadu state is divided into seven agro-climatic zones. The North Eastern Zone is located between 8°5’ and 13°2’ North latitude and76°15’and 80°22’ East longitude, covering an area of 31,065 Sq. km equivalent to 23.9per cent of the State area. The land is the basic resource over which all the agricultural operations are carried out. Land use statistics indicate the way in which the available land area is put under various uses. Land as a scarce resource, has to be managed effectively. The total geographical area of the State is 13 million ha. The area under forest is around 21 lakh ha accounting for 16 per cent of the geographical area. The various crops, food grains constituted 78.83 % of the area followed by Oil seeds (10.80%) 25 Tamil Nadu 492 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 and Sugarcane (6.48%). Among the food grains Rice constituted (38.44%) of the total area under major crops. Tamil Nadu with 7.0 per cent of population in the country is endowed with only3.0 per cent of the water resources of India. The State’s water resources are dependent on rainfall. The per capita availability of water in the State stood at 900 cubic meters only as against the All – India level of 2200 cubic meters. 25.1 PRODUCTIVITY GAPS AND MAJOR CONSTRAINTS A. Agriculture   The major strengths of the sector are:   Introduction of crop specific strategies like System of Rice Intensification (SRI), System of Pulses Intensification (SPI), Sustainable Sugarcane Initiatives (SSI) and precision Farming for agricultural and horticultural crops which are developed mainly to bridge the yield gap.   Creation/Improvement in establishment of agricultural marketing infrastructure and promoting primary producer-owned agri business ventures.   Increasing the cultivable area and diversifying the cultivation in favor of high value, organic horticulture and commercial crops while ensuring food and nutritional security for all.   Assessing the requirement of agricultural inputs so as to meet the local needs effectively and ensuring availability of adequate quantity of inputs at appropriate time and that are to be locally produced.   Reclamation of saline and alkaline soil, issue of Farmers’ Integrated Handbooks   (FIHB).   Promoting hi-tech agriculture, precision farming and micro irrigation for efficient use of irrigation water – Promoting horticulture technologies and micro irrigation as whole village concept.   Farm level interventions for ’end to-end’ involvement of extension staff with individual farmer – conducting pre-season village campaigns (Uzhavar Peruvizha) in close coordination with the all allied disciplines. Capacity building for farm based research and agriculture innovation and excellence by the farmer’s Supply of gender friendly equipment such as power/cono weeders and markers. Challenges Agricultural operations are however constrained by sub-optimal water resources to a great extent.
