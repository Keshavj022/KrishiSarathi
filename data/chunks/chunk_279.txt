Package of practices for ‘DBGC 3’ Attribute Detail Sustainability of the genotype for the area It is slightly early, and could be an ideal variety for bringing about sustainable crop intensification post- rice cultivation in rice fallow cropping systems of eastern Indian states Selection of field/land preparation Well drained sandy loam/loam soils; one harrowing followed by two ploughing Seed treatment Seed treatment with Vitavax (1g/kg seed)/Trichoderma (6-8g/kg seed) and Rhizobium (200 g/10 kg seed) Sowing time Second to third week of November for realizing its maximum yield potential Seed rate/sowing method-line sowing with row-to-row & plant- to-plant distance Seed rate: 75 kg/ha; sowing with seed drill at 8-10 cm depth; Spacing: 30 cm (row-to-row) × 10 cm (plant-to- plant within the row) Fertilizer doses 20 kg N + 40 kg P2O5 + 20 kg S + 25 kg ZnSO4/ha; FYM: 5-10 t/ha Weed control Pre-emergence herbicide application of Pendimethalin @ 0.75-1.0 kg ai/ha followed by hand weeding at 25- 30 and 55-60 days after sowing Disease and pest control Disease: Seed treatment with fungicides Pest control: Indoxacarb @400 mL/ha; Spinosad @ 200 mL/ha Irrigation One at pre-flowering and one at pod development as per need Harvesting Harvested when crop turns completely yellow-brown and plants start senescence Quality characteristics of the variety, if any Attractive grain colour, optimum grain size and shape Attainable yield (t/ha) Average yield: 1.8-2.0 t/ha (with a potential of 2.8 t/ha) Seeds of 'DBGC 3' Indian Farming 10 January 2024 SUMMARY The advance breeding line ‘DBGC 3’ is high-yielding with several unique characteristics including double flower per peduncle and presence of waxy-like substances on the exterior surface of leaves. It is management responsive with a yield potential of 2.8 t/ha. It is resistant/moderately resistant to root diseases such as wilt, dry root rot (MR reaction at BAU, Sabour during 2021-22 and 2022-23) and collar rot (MR reaction at Shillongani during 2022-23). It has also shown moderate resistance to Botrytis grey mold (at Pant Nagar during 2021-22) and chickpea stunt (at BAU, Sabour during the year 2022- 23). It has also exhibited tolerance to gram pod borer. Its grain colour is highly attractive.
