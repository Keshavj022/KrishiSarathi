 Research for Tribal and Hill Regions NORTH WEST HIMALAYAS Breeder seed production: During the period under report, 17.453 tonnes breeder seeds of 49 released varieties/inbreds of 15 crops were produced and 16.054 tonnes breeder seeds were supplied to different seed producing agencies for downstream multiplication to foundation and certified seed. Quality seed production: Around 1,433 kg nucleus seed of 40 released varieties of 15 crops were also produced following standard methods of maintaining genetic purity. In addition to this, 401 kg Truthfully Labelled (TL) seed of 09 varieties of 07 crops were produced and 258 kg TL seeds were supplied to different stakeholders. ​ Crop varieties released and notified Crop Variety Area of adoption Salient features Wheat VL Cookies (VL 2041) Northern Hills Zone comprising Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Manipur and Meghalaya • Possesses an excellent biscuit quality (spread factor) value of 11.7 (the highest in the country) and a mean grain hardness index of 22.6. • Average grain yield of 29.6 q/ha in rainfed and 49.8 q/ha irrigated conditions.

However, long- term application of synthetic fertilizers alone reduces the yield (-20.3 to -117.4) of both crops compared to the first year of experimentation.
