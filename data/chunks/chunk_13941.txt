 Additionally, informants mentioned that such platforms shall streamline the credit application process, making it more efficient and accessible to those who reside in the remote areas. “When I can access everything I need—loan applications, financial management, market information, and expert advice—from one digital platform, it removes the confusion and empowers me to plan my farming activities more effectively” (P 33). “If we had a unified platform that offered integrated financial services, market intelligence, and tailored advisory support, it would greatly reduce the complexity of managing farm finances and open up new opportunities for growth” (P 57). 3.3. Theme 3: Policy interventions In addition, the study sought how policymakers can implement better agricultural credit policies that foster access to credit to farmers based on transparency and accountability. The informants focused on four areas with a multifaceted approach (Table 4): single window sys­ tem, holistic evaluation and feedback systems, incentive schemes, and soil testing. 3.3.1. Single window system Participants believe that introducing single window systems is crucial, integrating various government departments of the agriculture sector, financial and service provides, and simplifying the procedures for loan applications, approvals and disbursements. This policy intervention will enhance farmers ability to access credit in a timely and efficient manner during the critical phases of agricultural production. “A one-stop integrated platform will be transformative, making it easier for marginalized farmers to navigate the bureaucracy and secure the credit required for sustainable agricultural development” (P 25). “Integrating various government and financial services into one platform will not only simplify loan procedures but also enhance transparency and accountability, leading to improved credit management and better out­ comes for farmers” (P 63). 3.3.2. Holistic evaluation Stakeholders are advocating for a holistic evaluation system that integrates financial, agronomic, and socio-economic indicators to create a more accurate and equitable assessment of farmer potential. “A comprehensive evaluation system that goes beyond traditional finan­ cial metrics is essential for recognizing the diverse strengths and challenges of rural farmers. This approach can empower underserved communities by providing them with tailored financial support and opportunities for growth” (P 29). “Integrating various data points—ranging from land records and crop performance to market trends—into a holistic evaluation system allows us to better understand a farmer's creditworthiness and manage risk more effectively, leading to more confident lending decisions” (P 48). According to the participants, this approach shall also include assessing farmers' agricultural practices, income potential and risk management strategies.
