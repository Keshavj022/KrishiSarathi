7 g/fruit), productivity (15.61 kg/tree) or quality (32.72 °Brix), when compared to 100% RDF along with 10 kg FYM/tree (13.72 kg/tree, 320.2 g/fruit, 31.65 °Brix) either under rainfed or fertigated situations. Precision farming technology in banana: Fertigation of 75% N, P2O5, K2O (derived from STCR equation) along with irrigation at 80% ER and polyethylene mulching (100 μ thickness) in combination with foliar spray of (2%) micronutrient Banana Shakti (at fourth, fifth and sixth MAP) and bunch spraying with 2% potassium sulphate (once at male bud removal and again 30 days later) significantly enhanced the yield of banana cv. Grand Naine in Karnataka, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The yield enhancement was to a tune of 22 to 44% with B:C ratio of 2.78 to 3.37. The treatment can also significantly advance the harvest by 28 to 40 days, besides improving the fruit quality with respect to TSS and shelf life. Organic farming in banana: In Grande Naine banana, the application of poultry manure + groundnut cake + rural compost + wood ash + VAM + PSB + KSB yielded bunches (23.5 kg) which were on par with with 100% inorganically fertilized banana plants. The nutrient uptakes (g/plant) and the leaf nutrient concentrations of organically grown banana were also on-par with 100% inorganically fertilized crop. The organic inputs caused decline in soil pH from 8.2 to 7.2, increased EC (dS/m) from 0.21 to 0.23 and organic matter from 0.12 to 0.72%, at harvesting. The organic banana grown soil had good number of CFUs of Actinomycetes (713×101), fungi (45×102) and bacteria (153×103). The B/C of this best treatment was 1.9 against 2.8 that of inorganic fertilizer alone. The ‘r’ values for soil available nutrients indicated a significant matching of nutrient releasing and uptake patterns in organic banana farming. DRIS norms for oil palm: The Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) indices for oil palm in two districts of Andhra Pradesh, viz. Srikakulam (–1.78, 1.23, –0.87, –0.9 and 2.32 for N, P, K, Mg and B respectively. N>Mg>K>P>B is the order of importance of nutrients) and Vizianagaram (the order of importance of nutrients is K>P>N>B>Mg and their corresponding DRIS indices are –2.4, –0.7, 0.39, 1.64, 3.98, respectively) were developed. The critical leaf nutrient concentrations were worked out for both the districts separately using Beaufills method. The optimal ranges for N, P, K, Mg and B in leaf samples of Srikakulam District were 0.84–1.31, 0.13–0.23, 0.61–1.03, 0.47–0.77% and 49–92 ppm, respectively. In Vizianagaram district the critical leaf concentrations ranged at 0.98–1.53, 0.13–0.20, 0.73– 1.11, 1.81–2.82, 0.50–0.63, 0.66–1.58 (%) and 57– 103 ppm for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S and B respectively. Vegetable crops Indian good agricultural practices (GAP) for production of potato: Indian GAP for the potato production as per the guidelines of Quality Council of India (QCI) was documented.
