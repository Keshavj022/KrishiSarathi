 Their ability to collect real-time, high-resolution data over large areas can help farmers overcome challenges related to the reliance on natural rainfall, limited resources, and climate variability. Aerial monitoring and mapping: Drones equipped with multispectral and thermal cameras can capture detailed images of farmland, which help assess crop health, detect stress areas, and monitor growth patterns. Precision agriculture: Drones can be used to apply fertilizers, pesticides, and even seed dispersal in a targeted manner. This ensures that only specific areas of the field receive treatment, optimising input usage and minimising costs. Data collection: Drones provide valuable data for ML and AI algorithms by surveying large tracts of farmland quickly and efficiently. This data includes information on crop vigour, soil quality, and potential problem areas. Functions of drone in agriculture AI and ML Functions Data analytics: AI& ML algorithms can analyse large dataset on weather, soil health, and crop conditions to predict weather patterns, droughts, and optimal planting time. This helps farmers make informed decisions on crop selection and timing for planting and harvesting. Forecasting: By integrating multiple datasets, AI & ML can forecast potential crop yields, enabling farmers to better plan for harvests and market strategies. Developed algorithms can predict soil moisture content and water availability based on historical and real-time data, helping farmers optimize the use of rainwater and reduce wastage. These models can analyse images and data to detect early signs of crop diseases and pest infestations, allowing for timely intervention and reducing potential losses. Decision support systems: These platforms offer real- time decision support for crop management, suggesting practices like fertilisation schedules and pest control based on the collected data. Indian Farming 84 January 2025 Spray agricultural drones are part of a broader category of agricultural Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs) that integrate advanced technology such as Global Positioning System (GPS), sensors, and AI to enhance productivity and sustainability in farming. They are designed to be user-friendly, often equipped with software that allows for easy programming and operation by farmers. Drones are transforming rainfed agriculture by providing high-resolution, real-time data that enhances decision-making and resource management. While there are challenges to overcome, such as costs and technical training, the benefits of adopting drone technology in rainfed farming are substantial, making it a valuable investment for the future of agriculture. IoT (Internet of Things) and Smart farming The Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a significant role in transforming rainfed agriculture by providing real-time data collection, remote monitoring, and automated decision-making tools. This technology helps farmers address the inherent challenges of rainfed production systems.
