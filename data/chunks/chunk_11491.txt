 Water harvesting structure may be constructed to maintain water uptake and keep them healthy During lean winter there isn’t enough green jungle forages. Planting of perennial cold hardy grasses and tree fodders in the range may be done. Winter stress has negative effect on immunity, fertility, and production. Ensure timely deworming, vaccination, and mineral supplementation to keep the Mithun in good health and in optimum production. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 296 TRIPURA Rabi Rice Transplanting of boro rice should be completed within the month of December to January and preparation of nursery bed should be within 15th Nov-15th Dec. At time of preparation of nursery bed 1kg Urea, 3kg SSP and 800g MOP applied as a basal for one square meter area. Prepare land for transplanting of boro rice by puddling the field twice at 7-10 days’ intervals and level for uniform crop stand. Transplanting should be done @ 2–3 seedlings per hill at a spacing of 20 x 15 cm or 20 x 20 cm and a thin layer of water (1‐2 cm) should be maintained in the main field up to 10 days after transplanting. MTU 1010, Swarno, Naveen, Tripura Chikon, Gomati, Sahabhagi are the suitable variety for boro season. Boro rice requires 1000 sq. meter nursery area for one-hectare land. Seed treatment with bio control agent like Pseudomonas florescence (10-15 g per kg of seed), followed by seedling root dip @ 2.5 kg/ ha dissolved in 1000 liter of water for 30 minutes or Carbendazim/ Tricyclazole @ 2 g/kg of seed or Agroson/Ceresan 2.5 g//kg of seed may be practiced. For good crop apply FYM @ 5 t/ha and one third of the Nitrogen (43 kg Urea/ha) and full dose of P and K (250 kg SSP and 68 kg MOP/ha) should be applied as basal. While applying the fertiliser, a thin film of water in the field should be maintained. Remaining two doses of nitrogen should be applied at tillering and panicle initiation stage. Water should be maintained up to a depth of 2-5 cms right from one week after transplanting till 2 to 3 weeks before harvest. It should be noted that if irrigation facilities are available, water may be drained out from the field before top dressing of nitrogenous fertilizers. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 297 This is done to avoid undue loss of fertilizer due to runoff. The field may again be irrigated 2 to 3 days after top dressing. Use cono-weeder in boro rice field to control weeds in standing water. Spray Triflumezopyrin 10% SC @ 95g/acre or Pymetrozine 50% WG @ 120g /acre for controlling plant hopper infestation. Rabi Maize Different varieties like RCM 1-1, RCM 1-2, RCM 1-3, DA 61-A, RCM 75, RCM 76, Vijay Composite, HQPM-1, HQPM-2, VMH- 45, Ganga-11, Ganga-2 may be cultivated during rabi season. Ideal time for sowing of Rabi Maize is Mid-November. Treat the seeds before sowing with Trichioderma solution by using 200-250 g for 10-15 minutes.
