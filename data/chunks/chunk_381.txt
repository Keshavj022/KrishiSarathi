 This variety exhibits desirable features i.e., erect, high number of millable canes, non- lodging, non-flowering and absence of pithiness and splits on internodes. This clone was recommended for the irrigated condition. CoLk 14204 (Ikshu-8) This variety has been developed by ICAR-IISR, Lucknow in mid-late group and released in 2021 for North West Zone i.e. for Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Central and Western Part of Uttar Pradesh. This variety was developed by crossing between CoLk 8102 and CoSe 92423 in N.H.G., Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore, followed Indian Farming 5 November 2023 by clonal selection. The variety recorded 92.73 t/ha cane yield, 11.39 t/ha CCS yield and 17.73% sucrose in juice. The clone showed moderate disease resistance against red rot. CoPb 14185 (CoPb 98) This variety has been developed by PAU RS, Faridkot in the mid- late group and released in 2021 for North West Zone. It was developed by clonal selection from the poly cross (PC) progenies of CoS 8436. The cane yield of CoPb 14185 was 88.99 t/h, 18.50% sucrose in juice and 11.58 t/ha CCS yield. The distinguishing characteristics of the variety are medium thick whitish-yellow green cylindrical cane (i.e. ~210.50 cm length, ~2.44 cm diameter), with pentagonal bud, curved leaf canopy, purple dewlap, incipient auricle and deltoid ligule. The variety has high sugar potential and is very responsive to fertilizers and irrigation without lodging. It showed moderate resistance against red rot disease. As a result, it is expected that this will improve sugar recovery and cane productivity of the nation. SUMMARY The newly developed sugarcane varieties for the North-west zone by different research institutes and SAUs exhibit high yield as well as resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. The recently released early maturing sugarcane varieties for this zone, such as CoLk 11203, Co Pant 12221, Co 15023, CoS 13235, and CoLk 14201, along with the mid-late maturing varieties CoLk 11206, Co Pant 12226, Co Pant 13224, CoLk 14204, and CoPb 14185, exhibit resistance to red rot disease of sugarcane. Therefore, these varieties serve as good replacements for Co 238 against this highly destructive sugarcane disease. Moreover, the majority of the described varieties also exhibit resistance to smut disease and tolerance to lodging conditions. The mid-late maturing variety CoLk 11206 is suitable for multiple ratooning and also for producing green fodder. Hence, in the extreme climatic conditions of sub-tropical India, these varieties can provide significant benefits to the sugarcane-growing farmers. *Corresponding authorâ€™s e-mail: divyachaudhary6767@gmail.com Co Pant 12226 (A) and Co Pant 13224 (B) Mid-late maturing sugarcane varieties.
