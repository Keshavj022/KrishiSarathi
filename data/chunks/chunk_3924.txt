 Rajkumar, a founder of the Save Kurinji Campaign Council. The last blooming July–August 2023 39 of Strobilanthes kunthianus (Neelakurinji) in Kerala is considered an item for revenue and it is estimated that it had generated a huge revenue within three months. Sadly, very little of this money is ploughed back for the effective conservation and management of Neelakurunji. Therefore, further monitoring and conservation of its population is highly recommended. In 2018, Jomy Augustine published a book named “Strobilanthes in the Western Ghats, India. The Magnificent Role of Nature in Speciation”. In his book, he broadly sketches the geographical reach of the 64 species of Strobilanthes in Peninsular India. As per environmentalists, over-tourism through high footfall in this region might spoil the bloom. Therefore, environmentalists urge respective forest departments to restrict entry to a few visitors. The local authorities and administration is taking measures to preserve the bloom and not let it get spoiled by excess tourists. As an individual citizen, people need to conserve the threatened biodiversity by acting responsibly they visit the site as a tourist. Further, necessary conservatory measures should be enacted by the forest department and conservatory boards to conserve such unique diversity of ‘Neelakurunji’. Future prospects y Ecotourism: The blooming of Neelakurinji flowers attracts a large number of tourists and nature enthusiasts. As awareness about the flower spreads, it is expected that ecotourism in the areas where Neelakurinji grows will increase. This can create opportunities for local communities to benefit from tourism-related activities such as accommodation, transportation, guided tours, and souvenir sales. y Conservation and research: The unique flowering pattern of Neelakurinji makes it an interesting subject for scientific research. The flower’s ability to bloom periodically after long intervals has fascinated botanists and ecologists. Further research and conservation efforts can help in understanding the ecological significance of this species and implementing measures for its protection. y Ho r t i c u l t u re a n d cultivation: Given the popularity of Neelakurinji flowers, there may be attempts to cultivate them in controlled environments or gardens. This could involve studying the plant’s growth requirements, o p t i m i z i n g b l o o m i n g conditions, and exploring techniques for propagation. Successful cultivation may lead to a more predictable availability of Neelakurinji blooms and contribute to the floral industry. y Biodiversity conservation: Neelakurinji is an indicator species for the Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its rich biodiversity. The conservation of Neelakurinji habitats will benefit other plant and animal species that are dependent on the same ecosystem.
