 [Action: All SAUs)] Agenda 26: Courses on Rodentology, AINP on Rodent Control CAZRI, Jodhpur proposed that the curriculum for UG/PG programmes must include separate courses on Rodent Pest Management and / or Vertebrate Pest Management. The existing contents of the course taught under Entomology are very meagre and therefore, require further strengthening so that UG/PG/PhDs on rodent / vertebrate pest management are available. Also, Project Coordinators of AICRPs/AINPs should be involved in selection process for filling up scientific vacancies of the Project at SAU based centres. The scientists working in AICRPs/AINPs in SAU based centres may not be transferred quite frequently and concerned PCs may be consulted while transferring the Project Scientists. [Action: All SAUs; ADG (EQR)] The meeting ended with a vote of thanks by Dr. R.K. Mittal, ADG (EQR).
