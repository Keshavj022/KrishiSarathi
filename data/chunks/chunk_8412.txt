 Decision Support System for enhancing water productivity of irrigated rice-wheat cropping system: From the four years of experimentation, it can be concluded that the SRI and DSR methods of rice cultivation resulted in higher grain yield and saving of water as compared to puddled method. Further the crop simulation models, viz. AquaCrop and CERES- rice and wheat modules of DSSAT were calibrated and validated for all experimented rice and wheat cultivars under different rice cultivation methods and irrigation regimes and the water production functions were developed. The data acquired from field experiments were used as background data base for the development of water productivity decision support system for RWCS (WPDSS-RW).The developed DSS was operated with input data of different cultivars, cultivation methods, rainfall depths etc. for different locations to generate scenarios of grain yield under different irrigation depths, water productivity, water saving and consequent increase in the groundwater table information for enhancing water productivity of the study region. ‚ùë Direct recruitment/lateral entry During the period, ASRB completed the recruitment process for 94 posts. Of these, 43% posts were Research Management Positions (Directors of National Institutes, Deputy Directors General, Assistant Directors General, Directors, Project Directors, Joint Directors of National Institutes and Joint Directors of other than National Institutes), 60% posts were for Head of Divisions, Project Coordinators and Principal Scientists. The Board has recommended 88 posts while only six posts could not be filled due to non-availability of suitable candidates. in the discipline of Home Science (1.36%) and highest percentage of candidates qualified was in the discipline of Floriculture and Landscaping (65.90%), followed by Veterinary Anatomy (61.02%), Animal Reproduction and Gynaecology (52.17%), Seed Science and Technology (47.19%), Livestock Product Technology (44.32%) and Fish Nutrition (42.11%). In 10 disciplines, the success rate was less than 10%. 19. Strengthening the Research System ARS (Preliminary) Examination-2015 Combined examination for NET and ARS (Prelims) 2015 was conducted in online mode at 22 centres across India except Chennai centre. The examination at Chennai centre could not be held due to unforeseen rains and floods in and around Chennai. It was subsequently held during 6-12 January 2016. Out of 9,936 candidates appeared in preliminary examination, 2,217 candidates (22%) qualified for Main Examination. ARS Main Examination was conducted on 8 May 2016 at 12 centres. Out of 2,217 candidates, 1,764 (80%) appeared for 97 vacancies in 30 disciplines. The viva voce were conducted from 13 October 2016 to 29 November 2016 for 363 qualified candidates. NET Examination-2015 A total of 30,066 candidates registered for the NET Examination-2015 and 21,478 candidates appeared in the examination.
