 Chara was found to be Chara (Division Charophyata, Class Charophyceae, Order Charaleas, Family Characeae ). In some places Nitella spp. was found along with it. The algae occurs in kharif paddy field during August– September in stagnant water. Chara omits foul smell, for which it is known as gundhi. PRA and field study The PRA tools were applied to evaluate the performance of karada leaves in controlling chara in different doses. There were four treatments differing in application rates of karada leaves, viz. (i) 200 kg/ha, (ii) 250 kg/ha, (iii) 300 kg/ha and (iv) 350 kg/ha. Observations on reduction in chara and yield of rice were taken at village Panipaila of dist. Nayagarh, Orissa. Experiment The experiment was conducted at Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI), Cuttack in controlled condition and at village Panipaila, (Orissa) in farmer’s field. In CRRI a series of doses ranging from 1 to 5 g leaf samples of karada were applied to the 45 days old potted plants of variety Jaya with 50 g chara in each replication. Copper sulphate was also applied as a treatment. Untreated plants with chara were considered as control. Each treatment was replicated thrice. Observations were taken at 5 days interval upto 15 days of transplanting of the quantity of chara species. In farmer’s field, chara and copper sulphate were applied @ 300 kg and 10 g/ha respectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Chara appears after about 50 days of transplanting and becomes more abundant 70 days onwards. It suppresses the growth of rice plant, reducing tillering and yield. Farmers of Panipaila use karada leaves to protect crop from chara infestation. About 70% of the farmers using Fig. 2. Gundhi chara infestation in farmer’s field Fig. 3. Application of karada against gundhi Fig. 4. Karada turns the water black its growth. Tillering and growth of the rice plant is affected to such an extent that sometimes the yield loss exceeds to 50% or more. Gundhi consumes oxygen from rice-field water, adversely affecting the respiration of rice plants, which  PEST AND DISEASE MANGEMENT Table 2.
