 Excessive use of water in transplanting method of rice cultivation resulted into depletion of water resources. To avoid burden on water resources and to cultivate rice crop successfully, DSR technique is very useful. The technology is also helpful in recharging of underground water table. Direct seeded crop of rice ripens 7-10 days earlier than transplanted crop which in term is helpful in management of paddy straw and sowing of succeeding wheat crop timely. Steps which are essential for successful cultivation of direct seeded rice crop are as follows- ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 45  Type of Soil: Direct seeding of rice should not be done in light textured soils. Efforts should be made to select fields for direct seeding crop where rice crop was cultivated in last kharif season.  Selection of varieties: Short duration varieties of rice crop should be selected for direct seeding method. Important rice varieties suitable for direct seeding method are – PB-1509, PB-1121, Punjab Basmati-7, PR-126, PR-122, PR-127, PR-128, PR- 129.  Time of Sowing: First fortnight of June month is optimum time of sowing of direct seeding rice crop. However, sowing of very short duration varieties i.e. PR-126 and PB-1509 in second fortnight of June.  Seed Rate: Quantity of seed required for direct sowing of rice crop is 20-25 kg/ ha. Soaking of seed before 8-12 hours of sowing and seed treatment with carbendazim with 3 g/ kg seed is also essential.  Field Preparation: Use laser leveller in the field selected for direct seeding of the crop. Apply irrigation after laser levelling. Cultivate the field at field capacity (tar vattar) stage followed by planking twice and sowing immediately.  Method of sowing: Do sowing of crop after preparation of the field. Avoid preparation of field and sowing of crop during noon hours. Use lucky seed drill or press wheel seed drill for direct seeding of crop. Row – Row spacing of 20 cm should be maintained with 3-4 cm depth of sowing.  Weed management: Apply pendimethalin 2.5 litre/ha in 500 litres of water immediately after sowing of the crop. It should be followed by early post emergence (15-25 DAS) of bispyribac sodium 10 SC @ 250 ml/ha or phenoxyprop P ethyl 6.7 EC @ 1 liter/ ha or chlorimuron ethyl + methsulfuron methyl 20 WP @ 20 g/ ha or cyhalofop butyl + penoxsulam @ 2.25 litre/ ha or triafamone + ethoxysulfuron @ 225 g/ha.  Irrigation Management: Apply first irrigation at 21 days after sowing of crop in tar batar condition. Further irrigations should be applied at 5-7 days’ intervals depending on soil moisture availability and rainfall occurrence.  Fertilizer Use: Apply 150 kg N/ ha in three splits at four, six and nine weeks after sowing of the crop in direct seeded non basmati varieties. Application of 60 kg N/ ha in three splits at three, six and nine weeks after sowing of direct seeded basmati varieties of crop. Foliar application of 1.
