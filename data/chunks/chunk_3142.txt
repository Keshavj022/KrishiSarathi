Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years): 3.1 Development of animal test instrumentation/devices 3.1.1 Portable electronic weighing balance (capacity=1.5 tonne). It was developed for weighing of animals at sites (In villages) instead of bringing animals to balance at fixed installations. It has 12v battery and inverter system to operate in absence grid electricity. It takes 60 seconds per animal to weigh compared to 130 seconds with mechanical‐manual system. The unit costs Rs. 75,000/‐. 3.1.2 Instrumented treadmill Instrumented treadmill was developed for measuring physiological haematological, biochemical, skin temperature, cardiovascular and muscle strain responses along with distress symptoms of work animals at different load, speed, slope and duration under varying controlled environment conditions. The system was useful to measure the work and power output of animals in simulated seasonal conditions so as do develop matching equipment for higher output during the limited period of the season. www.icar.org.in 27 2002 ‐ 2007 3.1.3 Improved Yokes and harnesses Modified yokes were developed using locally available materials for draught animals of different regions as per the breed, size, neck muscles configuration and shape of hump. Due to increased and intimate contact area of yoke on neck muscles the pulling capacity of animal has increased by 10% over the traditional yokes (Draft load = 40 kg) as it has facilitated reduced pressure on neck while pulling load without frequent sliding/rubbing on neck and thus preventing injury to neck in continuous work. The unit price varies from Rs.350/‐ to Rs.700/‐. 3.2 Development of equipment 3.2.1 Animal drawn improved puddler Different designs of puddlers have been developed suiting to the draft capacity of animals and type of soils for higher quality of puddling at reduced no. of passes (2 passes) compared to the traditional method of puddling by country plough or comb harrow (4‐5 passes). Due to rolling action requiring lower draft (50‐60 kg) the soil dispersion was higher compared to the traditional practice (Cost of operation Rs/ha=2500/‐) at lower cost of operation by 70%. The equipment costs Rs 2000/ ‐ Rs 5000/‐ depending on the type and size of the puddler. 3.2.2. Animal drawn raised bed planter Animal drawn raised bed planter was developed for planting vegetable seeds: okra and pea on beds by mounting one two row inclined plate planter on a bund former. The unit costs Rs.3000/‐.
