 There is provision to change the spoon or cups welded on a ring that fits on the disc for sowing small onion bulbs and lady’s finger seed accordingly. The planter was tested for its performance on the TNAU, Coimbatore farm for sowing small onion and lady’s finger in red sandy loam soil in comparison with manual dibbling method. The field capacity was found to be 0.06 and 0.09 ha/hr in onion bulbs and lady’s finger seed, respectively. The cost of sowing with planter was Rs 740/ha as compared to Rs 1, 200/ha by conventional method. Attachments for Riding Type Self-propelled Reaper Windrower Seed drill: A 5-row unit of seed drill attachment has been developed at CIAE, Bhopal for operating with self-propelled riding type reaper. The seed drill has provision for varying row-to-row spacing from 225 to 300 mm. During kharif season, soybean variety JS 335 was sown on 0.43 ha area at a row spacing of 300 mm. The average field capacity was 0.27 ha/hr at a forward speed of 2.78 km/hr. During rabi season, Bengalgram was sown at a row spacing of 300 mm. The average field capacity was 0.332 ha/hr at a forward speed of 2.84 km/hr. Weeder: A weeding attachment was developed and evaluated at CIAE, Bhopal for weeding operation in soybean (JS 904) grown at 350 mm row spacing. The performance of weeder was satisfactory. Its field capacity was 0.288 ha/hr. Sprayer: A twin blower type spraying attachment was developed at CIAE, Bhopal. Power to spraying attachment was given through a V-belt and pulley arrangement from engine by stepping up the speed to achieve required speed of blower. Initial test results showed 1.2 l/min. of discharge, 2.7 m width of coverage, 0.88 ha/hr of field capacity and 88.5% of field efficiency. Application rate was found as 77.5 litres/ha. Self-propelled Power Weeder A new power weeder was made at CIAE, Bhopal by upgrading the engine to 3hp petrol-start kerosene-run engine. The weeder was tried for weeding operation of cotton crop sown at the Institute farm at 90 cm row-to-row spacing. The weeding operation was performed with 3 sweeps of 150 mm size as a single row machine. Evaluation of the power weeder indicated the mean values of effective field capacity; forward speed and weeding efficiency were 0.14 ha/hr, 2.10 km/hr and 80.7%, respectively without plant damage in cotton crop. Power Tiller-operated Multi-crop Planter The HPKV, Palampur Centre of AICRP on FIM has developed a power tiller- operated multi-crop planter, which weighs 34 kg. This machine was extensively evaluated with Mitsubishi power tiller (12 hp) on HPKV farm in silty clay loam soil and at farmers’ fields. The performance of this planter was compared with manual multi-crop planter and traditional method of sowing (seed dropping behind indigenous plough) for sowing maize, soybean and wheat crops in small plots of 10 m × 5 m. Field capacity (ha/hr) with the 3 systems was 0.18, 0.09 and 0.03 for maize, 0.16, 0.05 and 0.03 for soybean, and 0.09, 0.03 and 0.
