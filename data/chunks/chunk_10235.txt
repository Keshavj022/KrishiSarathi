Oilseeds Oilseeds account for 17.9% of arable land and 14.3% of the gross cropped area in India. India is the 4th largest vegetable oil economy in the world. India stands first in the production of castor, sesame, safflower, and niger, whereas second in groundnut, third in rapeseed- mustard, fourth in linseed and fifth in soybean. About 14 million farmers are engaged in oilseeds production and another million in their processing. Among the edible oilseed crops, soybean (36%), groundnut (32%), rapeseed-mustard (29%) contributed 97% of the total edible oilseeds production. Sesame, sunflower, safflower and niger contributed about 3%. Contrary to the production, the major contribution to domestic edible oil kitty comes from rapeseed-mustard (3.2 Mt, 45%), Groundnut (1.8 Mt: 25%), and Soybean (1.8 Mt, 25%) amounting to 95%.
