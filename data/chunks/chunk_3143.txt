 Compared to flat planted by manual dibbling (Okra yield, kg/ha=800, cost of operation, Rs./ha=1600/‐) it saved cost of operation by 60%, increased yield by 10% being the crop on bed and saved irrigation (Rs/ha=300) as the water could be retained in furrows for longer period. 28 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Agricultural Engineering www.icar.org.in 3.2.3 Animal drawn sprouted rice seeder Animal drawn sprouted rice seeder (8 rows) was developed for row seeding of rice in wet/puddle soil compared to farmer practice of random broadcasting of seeds (@120 kg/ha) which gives high plant mortality, uneven stand establishment and higher cost of weeding. Due to row seeding the savings in Rs/ha for seed=100, saving in labour use for thinning and gap tilling, Rs/ha=300/‐ and saving in labour use for weeding, Rs/ha =800/‐ were obtained. The unit price of the seeder is Rs. 4000/‐. 3.2.4 Animal drawn inter row crop seeder for rice and sesbania The equipment was developed for row seeding of rice intercropped with sesbania. For biasi operation the seeding unit was removed and the same frame with two‐row biasi plough was operated in row spaces when chopping and mixing of sebania was done. In traditional practice sesbaina seeds are either broadcasted or drilled separately in row spaces as an additional operation. Biasi operation is done thereafter by use of biasi plough. Compared to traditional practice (Rice yield, kg/ha = 2200, cost of operation, Rs/ha=900/‐) the equipment saved Rs 450/‐ per ha in cost of operation and increased yield by 250 kg/ha. The equipment costs Rs.3500/‐. 3.2.5 Animal drawn zero till drill 1,2,3‐row seed cum fertilizer zero till drills were developed for direct seeding of wheat under high soil moisture condition after harvest of rice. In traditional practice, farmers normally wait for the soil to be infriable condition after harvest of rice and doing 3‐4 tillage operations sow the wheat which often get delayed affecting the yield (Wheat yield, kg/ha=2800, cost of tillage‐seeding operation, Rs/ha 3000/‐). Use of zero till drill (2‐row drill) resulted in 75 % decrease in the cost of operation and increase in yield by 7.5% due to timeliness. The unit price of the 1,2 and 3 row drills are Rs. 2000/‐, 3000/‐ and 4000/‐, respectively. www.icar.org.in 29 2002 ‐ 2007 3.2.6 Animal drawn biasi cultivator Improved biasi cultivator (2 row) was developed for biasi operation in row‐seeded rice. In traditional practice, country plough is used in broadcasted rice which is time consuming and results in higher cost of operation, Rs/ha=1350/‐ and causes high plant mortality giving lower yield (Grain yield, kg/ha = 2500/‐). Due to improved biasi operation the grain yield was increased by 7.5% at reduced cost of operation by 50%. 3.2.
