  Brooders are given injection of Ovatide/Wova-FH @ 1.5–2.0 ml/kg body weight to female and 0.5-1.0 ml/kg to male.  Stripping is done after 8-12 h. Around 20,000-25,000 eggs are obtained from a female of 100g, which are mixed with milt suspension prepared prior to stripping.  Eggs are shifted to the hatching tanks maintained with mild-flow of water, where hatching occurs within 18-23 h of fertilization at water temperature of 27-29°C.  Larvae are given small-size live feed from second day onwards. With the increase in size, they are fed ad lib. with heterogeneous mixture of live zooplankton, tubifex worms and egg custard. Fry size is attained after 3-4 weeks.  The breeding technology has been largely adopted in West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh. 24 Pabdah Catﬁsh Ompok pabda (Hamilton, 1822)  Pabdah, an important small-size high-value catfish, inhabits rivers, tanks and ponds of Indian sub-continent.  Attains maturity in the first year and breeds during June-August. Sexes are distinguishable at maturity with females having smooth pectoral fins and bulged belly, whereas males have rough pectoral fins and pinkish-white anal papilla.  Captive breeding is undertaken by rearing broodstock in earthen ponds. Adult fishes of 30- 40 g are suitable for induced breeding.  Commercial hormone such as Ovatide/Ovaprim @ 1.0-2.0 ml/kg body weight to the female and @ 0.5-1.0 ml/kg body weight to the male is injected for induced breeding. Females usually become ready for stripping after 8-10 h of injection.  Prior to stripping of ova, milt suspension is prepared by removing testes and macerating in normal saline. Stripped eggs are fertilized with milt-suspension.  Fertilized eggs are incubated in flow-through hatchery, where hatching occurs after 22-24 h, and yolk-sac is absorbed after 3 days.  Free swimming larvae are reared in separate tanks and fed with plankton ad lib. Gradually, chopped tubifex larvae are added in the diet with increase of the larvae size.  Larvae are reared in shallow water depth of 3-4 cm initially and gradually increased to 15-20 cm with increase of larvae size (fry stage). A survival of 15-20% is generally achieved at fry stage.  The breeding technology has been largely adopted in West Bengal, Odisha, Assam and Tripura. Compiled by: Dr P.P.

In India, it is found in large rivers of north, central and southern parts. Potential species for diversification in freshwater aquaculture.  Breeds in flowing waters during monsoon season.
