60 lakh, the program aims to support 45,000 farmers nationwide, equipping them with the Indian Farming 74 (10): 57-60; October 2024 knowledge and tools needed to succeed in a challenging agricultural environment. The significance of such development programs is especially critical in resource-limited areas like Bundelkhand. Known for its undulating topography, hard-rock geology, and low soil fertility, the region faces frequent droughts and crop failures due to erratic rainfall patterns. Located in a semi-arid tropical climate, Bundelkhand’s population primarily relies on crop and livestock-based livelihoods, intensifying the need for effective agricultural strategies. Since 2016, the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute (IGFRI) in Jhansi, operating under ICAR, has been implementing FFP in Bundelkhand. The program has invested `183 lakh to enhance farmers’ knowledge and integrate advanced agricultural technologies into their practices. The focus has been on empowering farmers with resources that boost productivity and resilience in the face of climatic and economic challenges. The FFP’s impact in Bundelkhand is significant. It aims not only to increase agricultural yields but also Indian Farming 58 October 2024 to address broader issues of food security and rural development. By promoting collaboration between scientists and farmers, the program fosters co-created solutions that are both innovative and practical, ensuring their applicability to local conditions. This participatory approach is essential, as it supports the development of technologies that are beneficial and field-relevant. Promotion of improved varieties under Farmer FIRST Food crops: In Jhansi district of Uttar Pradesh, agriculture is central to the livelihoods of local farmers, with the kharif season dominated by major crops such as groundnut, greengram, and blackgram. During the rabi season, wheat becomes the main focus for many farmers. In addition, vegetable farming significantly contributes to local income. Farmer-scientist interactions in five villages—Dhikoli, Nayakheda, Ganeshgarh, Ramgarh, and Kanchanpur—during 2023-24 revealed that many farmers relied on traditional crop varieties, often due to limited knowledge of the yield benefits of improved varieties and difficulty in accessing them. This reliance on conventional varieties often results in lower yields and reduced economic returns, hindering overall community development. Recognizing the need for innovation, the Farmer FIRST Programme (FFP) of ICAR-IGFRI, Jhansi, promoted high-yielding and disease-resistant crop varieties in these villages. For instance, wheat farmers were encouraged to adopt RAJ-4079, a variety known for its high yield and environmental resilience. In pulses, IPM 02-03 was promoted for greengram cultivation, while TG 37-A, specifically bred for productivity and resilience, was introduced for groundnut.
