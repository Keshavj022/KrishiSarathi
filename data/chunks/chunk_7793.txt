Frontline demonstrations Cluster frontline demonstrations Pulses: National Level Cluster Frontline Demonstrations (CFLDs) on pulses were initiated to demonstrate the production potential of new pulses varieties and the related technologies. The project also aimed for enhancing the pulses production in the country. At the national level, 37,249 ha area was planned; out of which 36,844.34 ha area was actually covered with 75,139 demonstrations across the country under CFLDs on pulses. The budget allocation for CFPDs on pulses was ` 25.29 crore. In kharif 14,300 ha, rabi 17,832 ha and summer 4,712 ha area was covered under CFLDs of pulses. There was 263.23, 175.51 and 37.52% increase in yield over national average yield, state average yield and DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 124 Zone-wise allotment and actual area covered under pulses demonstrations (2018–19) TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, DEMONSTRATION AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 125 local check, respectively, in blackgram; 78.04, 26.23 and 40.49% in greengram; 62.62, 111.78 and 31.12% in pigeonpea; 131.84, 126.93 and 55.76% in chickpea; 71.41, 184.20 and 9.42% in fieldpea; 59.20, 118.68 and 26.43% in lentil; and 4.35, 77.90 and 29.63% in summer greengram under CFLDs on pulses. Oilseeds: During the reporting period, under CFLDs on oilseeds, 22,245 ha area was allotted out of which CFLDs on oilseeds were conducted in 20,654.45 ha (50,669 demonstrations) across the country. Demonstrations in 8,687.65 ha during kharif, 10,709.6 ha during rabi and 1,257.2 ha during summer were conducted.
