 Genome sequencing of Aphanomyces invadens, causal agent of mass-scale mortalities in cultured and wild fish, was carried out. The study will help in understanding the pathway of A. invadens infection syndrome in fish. Crop improvement: Major emphasis was to develop new varieties/hybrids tolerant to various biotic and abiotic stresses with enhanced quality. During the reported period, total 209 varieties were developed: 117 high-yielding varieties/hybrids of cereals comprising 65 of rice, 14 of wheat, 24 of maize, 5 of finger millet, 3 of pearl millet, 1 each of sorghum, barley, foxtail millet, kodo millet, little millet and proso millet and released for cultivation in different agro-ecological regions of the country. Twenty eight high-yielding varieties of oil seeds, 32 of pulses, 24 of commercial crops (cotton, sugarcane and jute) and eight of forage crops were released for cultivation in different agro- ecologies. Biofortified varieties of crops, viz. wheat (WB 2 and HPBW 01), maize (Pusa Vivek QPM 9, Pusa HM 4, Pusa HM 9 Improved), pearl millet (HHB 299, AHB 1200), Indian mustard (Pusa Double Zero Mustard 31) and lentil [Pusa Ageti Masoor (L 4717)], were developed for improved nutrition and health of consumers. Lipoxygenase-2 free soybean NRC 109 was developed and commercialized. A leaf rust resistant stock Selection 12 in wheat was developed from the cross between bread wheat line CM 108-31 × T. timopheevii. To identify co-dominant marker, large number of microsatellite markers representing long arm of chromosome 1 were synthesized and used in analyzing segregating generation and RILS developed from a cross between Nap Hal and UP 2425 in wheat. Three brown midrib genes useful for lignocellulosic biofuel production pyramided into two sorghum cultivars, CSV 20 and CSV 27. A new genic SSR marker Sb-bmr12 was developed for effective marker- assisted gene pyramiding. A high-density intraspecific consensus linkage map of 11 pigeonpea chromosomes comprising 932 markers that span a total map length of 1,411.83 cM was developed. Profiling of 23 varieties of Brassica rapa, 49 of pigeonpea and 13 of little millet was carried out using SSR markers. The genome sequencing of Indian jute variety JRO 524 (Navin) was accomplished. An in-vitro culture technique called ‘Embryo Rescue’ was employed for plantlet regeneration in cotton, which otherwise may be impossible in normal conditions. For the first time, efficient in-vitro callus induction and regeneration from mature seed explants in Sehima was reported. During 2016-17, total breeder seed production in field crops was 121,988.5 q against the indent of 104,045.7 q. A total of 33 varieties of horticultural crops comprising 10 in fruits, 3 in plantation crops, 9 in vegetables, 3 in tuber crops, 2 in spices, 5 in medicinal plants and one in mushroom, were developed during the reported period.
