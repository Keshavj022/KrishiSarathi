Fruit rot or phomopsis blight can be managed by pre-sowing treatment of the seeds with Captan @ 3 g/kg seeds (dry dressing) and spraying the affected plants with Dithane-M-45 @ 2.5 g/l of water. Little leaf can be managed by removing the affected plants in the early stages and spraying the affected plants with Acetamiprid 20% SP @ 100 g/ha to control the vector. Harvesting and yield The fruits are ready for first picking 50-55 days after transplanting when they have become shiny white in colour, have attained the marketable size but are still immature, soft and tender to touch and when cut, the seeds have not turned brown. The average fruit yield is 350 q/ha. Seed production The seeds of Pusa Safed Baingan-1 can be carried out during the kharif season from June to mid-December and it should be noted that the maturity of fruits should not coincide with the rainy season. Brinjal is an often cross pollinated crop which requires an isolation distance of 400 m and 200 m for the production of foundation and certified seeds, respectively. The flowers are light purple in colour. A minimum of three inspections is needed for rouging out the off types and unwanted plants i.e. a) before flowering or vegetative stage; b) at flowering and fruit setting stage and c) at fruit maturing stage. The diseased infected plants should be removed from the seed production field to avoid further spread. The matured and ripened fruits are ready for harvest when they have turned yellow in colour. The seeds are extracted the next day either manually by beating with a stick, seed extractor or with the help of a seed extracting machine. The seeds are then washed in clean water and dried in the shade till the moisture content of the seeds reaches 8% or below followed by sun. The average seed yield is 150-200 kg/ha. The minimum seed standards for foundation and certified seeds of brinjal are given in Table 4.
