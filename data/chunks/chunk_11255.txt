 Due to have shorter duration, these varieties are resistant to different pest and diseases like Sheath blight, brown spot etc. yy In medium to low land situation, long duration variety like Swarna Masuri (MTU 7029), CR 1009, CR 1017, CR 1018, CR Dhan 506, CR Dhan 507, Ranidhan, Dhiren etc may beused but should be transplanted at time at any cost yy Restrict to timely sowing of nursery (20th May-5 June) and timely transplanting (10th June -25th June) schedule for better grain quality and water saving. Strictly transplant within 20-25 days. yy In case of Long duration varieties apply 58 k neem coated urea + 250 kg SSP + 45 Kg MOP per ha at basal and 58 kg neem coated urea + 23 kg MOP per ha at 30 DAP as topdressing and another 58 Kg neem coated urea at 50 DAP yy In case of short duration varieties apply 44 kg neem coated urea + 190 kg SSP + 34 Kg MOP per ha at basal and 44 kg neem coated urea + 17 kh MOP per ha at 25 DAP as topdressing and another 44 Kg neem coated urea at 45 DAP yy Adoption of green manuring technology through Dhaincha cultivation in the field about 70 days prior to the transplanting in the main field and ploughing down for decomposition about 2-3 weeks before transplanting can improve the soil fertility and reduce the requirement of urea fertilizer. 105 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS yy Before sowing, treat rice seed with mancozeb + carbendazim 2gm or Trichoderma viridae 10gm by dissolving in 10-12 ml water per kg seed; make paste of fungicide solution and rub on the seed. Maize (Kharif) yy Different varieties like, Vivek -27 (very short); Parkash, X 3342 (short); Malviya hybrid, Makka 2, AH-58 (medium) and All- Rounder, 900 M Gold, Pro 311, Bio 9681, Seed Tech 2324 as long duration may be used yy Complete the sowing operation 12-15 days before the full onset of monsoon i.e Last week of June to First week of July. yy For better yield maintain plant to plant spacing 25 cm and row row spacing 75 cm. yy seed with mancozeb + carbendazim 2gm or Trichoderma viridae 10gm by dissolving in 10-12 ml water per kg seed; make paste of fungicide solution and rub on the seed to avoid the infection from the diseases like Leaf Blight, Banded leaf, Sheath Blight etc. yy Follow the raised bed planting technique as it is best than conventional method (ridge and furrow), especially in rainy season. yy Apply 10-to-15-ton FYM per ha, 10-15 days prior to sowing. yy Apply 450 kg SSP, 120 Kg MOP and 7.5 Kg Znso4 (Zinc Sulphate) per ha as basal Apply Urea in five splits as follows- 67 Kg at the time of sowing (Basal), 82 Kg at four leaf stage, Black gram (Kharif) yy Small and Marginal Farmers should cultivate Black gram in the rainfed, monocrop, upland or undulating land for better profitability and nutritional security than rice. yy Sowing should be done at last week of August to 1st week of September when 1st phase of monsoon will be lowered down.
