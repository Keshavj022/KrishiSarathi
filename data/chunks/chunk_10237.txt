 Besides, basic and strategic research on annual oilseeds are ongoing in commodity-specific institutes namely ICAR-Directorate of Groundnut Research, ICAR-Indian |Institute of Soybean Research, ICAR-Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research and the ICAR-Indian Institute of Oilseeds Research, and some other ICAR institutes like ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, ICAR-National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, ICAR-National Institute of Plant Biotechnology, and ICAR-Vivekanand Parvatiya Krishi Anusandhan Shala. Concerted research in these institutes and AICRPs led to development of improved varieties/ hybrids with a higher yield, earliness in maturity, photo-thermo-insensitivity, amenability to mechanization; superior quality, tolerance/resistance to major abiotic and biotic stresses, etc. This resulted in notification of 930 high-yielding climate-resilient varieties/hybrids of nine annual oilseeds for cultivation during 1969-2021. During 2014-2021, 251 varieties/ hybrids of the oilseeds have been notified comprising 42 of groundnut, 63 of soybean, 58 of rapeseed-mustard, 13 of sesame, 33 of linseed, 5 of niger, 12 of sunflower, 11 of safflower and 14 of castor. High genetic potential of the newly developed varieties/hybrids of nine annual oilseeds such as rapeseed-mustard (3.0-3.5 t ha-1); groundnut (3.5-4.0 t ha-1), Achievements in Field Crops in Independent India 97 soybean (2.2-2.8 t ha-1), castor (3.0-3.5 t ha-1), sunflower (2.0-2.5 t ha-1), sesame (1.0-1.5 t ha-1), safflower (1.0-1.2 t ha-1) can be exploited to further enhance the realized productivity at the farmers’ fields. Box 7: Canola Quality Indian Mustard: Pusa Double Zero 31 Indian mustard variety Pusa Double Zero Mustard 31 has low erucic acid (0.76% in oil) and glucosinolates (29.41 ppm in seed meal) content in comparison to >40.0% erucic acid and >120.0 ppm glucosinolates in other popular varieties. Around 0.5 million tons of canola oil being imported in our country is from transgenic gobhi sarson (Brassica napus) varieties and being sold at very high prices (more than Rs. 250 kg-1). The release of this variety has attracted the farmers and seed as well as oil industry for its production and marketing. In a short span of time of its release its breeder seed indent has reached to more than 5.0 q leading it to top five indented varieties of Indian mustard in the country. Table 6.
