 Lentil also showed significant response to sulphur in sandy loam soils and gave 92 to 119 kg ha‐1 (11‐15%) extra grain yield with the application of 20‐40 kg S ha‐1. Similarly in Haryana chickpea showed response to S application, in Hisar and gave 147 to 197 kg ha‐1 (10‐14%) extra grain yield. In medium black soils of Kheda districts chickpea gave 80‐458 kg ha‐1 (11‐26) extra grain yield with the application of 20‐40 kg S ha‐1. • In Coimbatore application of FYM @ 12.5 t ha‐1 recorded the highest grain yield of 5483 kg ha‐1 and it was on par with the addition of sewage sludge @ 2.5 t ha‐1+ FYM @ 12.5 t ha‐1 and sewage sludge @ 2.5 t ha‐1 + raw coirpith @ 12.5 t ha‐1. The micro nutrient availability ranged in the order of Mn > Fe > Cu > Zn. Deficiency of Zn was noticed in all the treatments. The heavy metal availability in the post harvest soil showed non‐toxic level irrespective of metals analyzed. Optimizing Zinc Requirement of Medicinal plants • Root and seed yield of Ashwagandha increased from 363 kg ha‐1 in control to 595 and 517 kg ha‐1 respectively with soil application of 5.5 kg Zn ha‐1. Minimum seed yield of 232 kg ha‐1 was recorded in the control plots. Root yield increased significantly with the application of zinc either through soil or foliar sprays over the control. Increase in yield was recorded up to 63.9 % with the soil application and 23.69 % with foliar spray of zinc. Foliar application of 0.2% ZnSO4 had increased the root yield but it was on par with the soil application of zinc by 10 kg ha‐1. Soil application of zinc resulted in higher seed yield compared to foliar application of zinc. • Mentha (Tagetes minuta) is an important medicinal plant. Application of B and Zn significantly increased the dry matter yield of mentha but effect of S application alone was statistically not significant. The conjoint application of two nutrients together or all three nutrients also resulted a significant increase in the dry matter yield over the control.. • Zinc application (5 kg Zn ha‐1) increased the oil yield of Tagetes minuta significantly by 45.0 and 41.6 per cent over control. Oil yield was highest (78.7 to 84.8 kg ha‐1) in treatment receiving or Zn + B. Oil yield is related to Zn./B ratio in plant tissue but no significant relationship was noted with either Zn/S or B/S. This indicated that the balance of Zn and B in the plant tissue of Tagetes minuta played a determining role in governing oil yield and Zn/B value around 1.09 to 1.23 resulted in the highest oil yield. 5.8. Front line demonstration • More than 120 FLDs were conducted to show responses of zinc, iron, boron, manganese on oilseeds, pulses and major cereal crops in different agro‐ecological zones. Application of 5‐ 10 kg zinc/ha, 1.0‐1.5 kg boron /ha and 20‐40 kg sulphur/ha was found optimum and is widely recommended to the farmers. www.icar.org.in 67 2002‐2007 Table 5.2 Crop response to boron fertilization in field trials conducted on different soils.
