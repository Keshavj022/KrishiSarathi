 Regions were often associated with the crops in which they specialize for various agronomic, climatic, hydro-ecological and even historical reasons. During green revolution phase for achieving food self-sufficiency, the cropped area and focus was more towards cereal crops. Under the changing climatic scenario, emerging new challenges and in the immediate aftermath of green revolution, the focus has to be shifted to non-cereal crops like oilseeds and pulses. There is a clear advantage of crop diversification with oilseeds in marginal eco-systems to make the cropping enterprise as a profitable venture avoiding risks as evidenced though successful examples in different agro-ecoregions of the country. Hence, crop diversification with oilseeds could be used as a tool for maximizing productivity, profitability leading to resource conservation. Given a desired policy frame work in place, oilseeds production can be increased to a limited extent by area expansion through replacement of non-remunerative crops, extension in rice fallows and problem areas, intercropping in widely spaced crops, as options in contingency planning, introduction in water scarce areas, diversification of rice-rice and rice-wheat systems, and by increasing competitiveness of oilseeds through value addition. *Corresponding author email: g.suresh@icar.gov.
