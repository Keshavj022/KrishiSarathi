 The Government of India has initiated a number of schemes and programmes namely Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) by subsuming various schemes such as National Horticulture Mission (NHM), National Horticulture Board (NHB), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) and Horticulture Mission for North East and Himalayan States (HMNEH) for the promotion and development of protected cultivation.

As seeds germinate best at 25-30°C where optimal temperatures for productivity should be between 18-30°C. The functioning of the female organs of flower are affected by low (14°C or less) night temperatures, and the number of viable pollen grains per flower reduce markedly which causes parthenocarpic (seedless fruit) effect and impairs germination. The fact of low night temperature effect is associated with reduced starch accumulation in pollen grains at 3 days before anthesis and a decrease of total soluble sugars in the mature pollen grains. To prevent the low night temperature affect during winter, exposing Capsicum plants to extremely high day temperatures (day/ night temperatures of 36 ± 2°C), obtained by keeping the greenhouse closed during the day to exploit solar heating. Flower buds will usually abort when night temperatures reach 30°C. Growing media (i) Soil system: It can be grown from sea level to an altitude of zero meters in loam or sandy loam soil with good water holding capacity but soil pH should be 5.5 to 6.8 for successful capsicum cultivation. While preparing the field for crop, soil should be worked to a fine tilth by repeated ploughing and pulverizing. Dead roots and weeds collected, removed and burnt. Well-decomposed organic manure @4-5 kg/m2 should be mixed thoroughly in the soil. The width of the bed should not more than 100 cm with a length of 150 cm to 200 cm. The inner bed spacing should be enough to facilitate weeding and watering without trampling the top of bed. The beds should be raised to about 1 cm above the field surface, so as to provide proper drainage of excess water. Mostly greenhouse capsicum crop is grown under drip irrigation systems. After preparation of beds, drip lines of 16:2:30 are laid on the beds and two drips lines are laid on each bed at a distance of 60-65 cm depending upon the bed size. (ii) Soilless system: In hydroponic system, Capsicum plants are grown in various media.
