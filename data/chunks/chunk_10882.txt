   In-situ soil moisture conservation techniques like compartmental bunding is recommended   Raise one row of cowpea for every five rows of groundnut wherever the red hairy caterpillar is endemic.   Management of Groundnut Root rot: Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g/kg or T. asperellum @ 4 g/kg and B. subtilis @ 10 g/kg of seeds Sugarcane   Suitable varieties for kharif season - Co 0212, Co 11015.   Daincha / Sunhemp can be intercropped in the wider spaced cane cultivated area for improving soil health and reducing the weed infestation. It also reduces early shoot borer incidences and increases cane yield. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 164   Cultivation of pulses as intercrop improves soil health and better weed control during early stage of crop. Intercrop greengram variety CO 8 to decreases the weed growth   Power weeder and earthing up with ridger to save the cost on labour and reduce human drudgery.   Soil application of TNAU micronutrient mixture @ 50 kg/ha as enriched farmyard manure is recommended for managing micronutrient deficiency and increasing the cane yield.   Foliar spraying of TNAU Sugarcane Booster @ 2.5, 3.75 and 5 kg/ha in 500 litres of water at 45,60 and 75 days after planting is recommended to enhance cane growth and weight, internodal length, cane yield, sugar content and offer drought tolerance.   Trash mulching to avoid incidence of early shoot borer de-trashing during 150th and 210th days of crop to reduce internode borer incidence. Application of waste decomposer to trash mulch stimulates microbes in soil flora.   Detrash at 5th month and keep it in furrow to retain the moisture and nutrients available to the crop.   To manage internode borer, install pheromone traps @ 10Nos. /ha for surveillance and monitoring, change the lure once in 45 days; release egg parasitoid, Trichogramma chilonis @ 2.5 cc/release/ha and six releases at fortnightly intervals starting from 4th month onwards; avoid the use of excessive nitrogenous fertilizers; detrash on the 150th and 210th day of planting.   To manage interveinal chlorosis, apply 25 kg of Ferrous sulphate/ha (or) foliar spray of 500 g of Ferrous sulphate in 100 litres of water/ha. Castor   Castor hybrids for kharif season: YRCH 1, YRCH 2, DCH-519, GCH-8   Spacing 120 cm x 90 cm under rainfed condition   Foliar application of Castor gold (0.5ml/litre of water) during flowering stage to induce more female flowers   Management of leaf hopper and other sucking pests: Foliar spray Bifenthrin @ 1.5ml/litre water or Azadiractin 1000 ppm @ 1ml/litre water during morning hours. Sesame   Recommended varieties are CO 1, Paiyur 1, VRI 1, VRI 2, TMV 7, VRI 3, VRI 4.   Sowing time: Second fortnight of May to Second fortnight of June.   To manage root rot and collar rot: Seed treatment with Trichoderma @4g/kg of seed, Bacillus subtilis @ 10 g/kg seed.   Seed treatment with T. asperellum @ 4 g/kg of seed and B. subtilis @ 10 g/kg seed.
