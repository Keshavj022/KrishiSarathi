It was also reported that generally male house bird frolick first followed by females. The villagers reported that frolicking of birds on the sand is an indicator of rain which may occur within few days. Sometimes, these birds continue frolicking  METHODS OF WEATHER FORECASTING daily for 2_3 days and rain occurs after that. The result of matrix scoring made by 25 key informants on six criteria for three alternative observations are given in Table 1. The findings are summarised as following: i. The key informants gave maximum score to Treatment 1, indicating that when sparrow frolicks wings in dry sand or dust, rain occurs on the same day. The difference between treatments in respect of rain occurring the same day was highly significant. ii. On the second criterion also the maximum score was given to Treatment 1, indicating that when sparrow frolicks wings in dry sand or dust, rain occurs after 1 day. The difference between treatments in respect of rain after 1 day was highly significant. iii. Treatment 1 was scored maximum in respect of extent of rain also. The difference between treatments in respect of extent of rain was highly significant. iv. No significant difference was found between treatments in respect of occurrence of storm only or cloud only. v. Treatment 1 also scored maximum in respect of reliability of rain. The difference between treatments in respect of reliability of rain was highly significant. Case study Results of the case study are summarized in Table 2. It was generally observed that the male bird first tests the sand with the help of its beak, perhaps for its temperature, and then frolicks its wings on the sand. Then female bird comes there and frolicks. If there is a problem of space, they bath turn-by-turn, otherwise they can take bath in sand together. In the mean time, they call other birds by making sound. Within a few minutes, a group of birds assemble and frolick either turn by turn or together depending upon the space available. While bathing, they also make cluttering sound. The results indicate that there is relation between frolicking of birds and appearance of clouds. In all the cases clouds were generally seen on the same day, whereas in 24 cases out of 38, rain was also observed. Heavy rain was observed only in eight cases. In most of the cases (16 cases) only little showers were observed. The validation results obtained by PRA method could not be supported as such by the actual cases observed. However, in all cases clouds appeared on the same day. Rain occurred in 65% cases.
