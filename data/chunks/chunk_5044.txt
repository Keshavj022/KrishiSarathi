 Still more vegetable remained as such (unaffected) in sheetal on day 5 also. It has been observed that spoilage in sheetal was due to water that percolated into the inner pot, where the vegetable was placed. This could Table 1.

Phase II As reported earlier, 10 experiments were conducted during June 2003 on three vegetables, viz. brinjal, bhindi and pointed gourd. The average weights were calculated for each vegetable at different intervals. The data are presented in Table 3. Brinjal: The results obtained by storing brinjal in sheetal were encouraging. The weight of brinjal remained less than half on the fifth day when kept outside. But in sheetal only 100 g weight was reduced on the fifth day. The loss of weight on third day was only about 40 g, whereas outside it was 370 g. In fact brinjal was not fit to be consumed even on day 3 when kept outside due to much shrinkage, change in colour and shine, hardness etc. But brinjal remained fresh on third day when kept in sheetal. Even on day 5, through there was slight shrinkage on a few brinjal fruits, it was fit to be consumed. Bhindi: The results obtained in respect of bhindi were also encouraging. The weight of bhindi remained about one- third on the fifth day when kept outside (380 g out of 1,000 g), whereas in sheetal only 230 g weight was reduced, out of which 50 g was spoilage. The loss of weight on the third day was 484 g. when kept outside, whereas it was only 130 g when kept in sheetal. The bhindi kept outside for 5 days was completely  GRAIN/SEED STORAGE Table 2.
