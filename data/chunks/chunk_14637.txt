Among the actinomycetes, members of the genus Streptomyces are of speciﬁc interest due to their metabolic versatility and ubiquity. The diversity of Streptomyces in different crop ﬁelds of Tamil Nadu has not been explored early. In this study, we explored phylogenetic diversity, morphological heterogeneity, and antifungal properties of cultivable actinomycetes isolated from the rhizosphere and bulk soils of different crops collected from 20 distinct districts of Tamil Nadu. A total of 65 actinomycetes were isolated from 40 soil samples including rhizo- sphere and bulk soils of different crops, and their diversity was analyzed using the 16S rRNA gene sequence. They were then characterized for cultural characteristics and antifungal activity against four fungal strains Fusarium udum, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. ciceri, Macrophomina phaseolina and Sclerotium rolfsii. Out of the 65 isolates sequenced, 45 were found to be closely related to Streptomyces spp. while the remaining 20 showed similarities with Nocardiopsis spp.
