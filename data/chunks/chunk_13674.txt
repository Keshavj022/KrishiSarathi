Determining Factors of Crop Diversiﬁcation in India The mean Shannon-Wiener index (si) of the panel was 0.82, although there was a huge difference between the minimum and greatest values. In numerous variables, such as rainfall deviation (raindev), credit intensity (crint), and urban population, we observed huge disparities in maximum and minimum values (lnupop). 3.3.1. Pooled-Regression Result The estimation based on a pooled regression model is shown in Table 2. Except for cropping intensity (ci), all other variables in this model have positively inﬂuenced crop diversiﬁcation. Except for two predictors (viz, rainfall deviation and credit intensity), all the predictors were statistically signiﬁcant and impacted the crop diversiﬁcation process as expected. However, before going forward, it is mandatory to check the other model estimation options in panel data regression methods, that is, the ﬁxed-effect model and random effect model. Table 2.

One-Way Fixed Effect Model–Individual Effect Model The individual (state-wise) ﬁxed-effect model is presented in this section. Table 3 below displays the results of the model’s coefﬁcient estimation, while Table 4 shows each state’s unique cross-sectional ﬁxed effects. Cropping intensity, irrigation intensity, fertilizer intensity, total road density, and credit intensity are found to have a substantial impact on crop diversity throughout the states of the nation in the ﬁxed effect (individual effect model). In the one-way ﬁxed-effect model, however, the demand-side factors such as urban population and per capita income are not found to be statistically signiﬁcant, though they are holding the desired direction of impact on the crop diversiﬁcation process.
