 Growth parameters In T2, T3 and T4 the growth of three species of Experiment The results of the experiment obtained are as follows: pH Water pH is considered as a best indicator of aquatic productivity. In the present study though there were some variations in pH value for different treatments, the general pattern of distribution of pH of water was alike in a particular treatment. Among treatments, pH tended to be high in T4 where lime was applied @ 500 kg/ha. Dissolved oxygen Dissolved oxygen is perhaps the best indicator of water quality. Ponds should have dissolved oxygen concentration above 5 ppm for average or good fish production. In the present study, all the ponds under T2,T3 and T4 had dissolved oxygen above 5 ppm, whereas in T1, in some    FISHERIES FISHERIES Table 3.

The results obtained from this study indicated that Survival rate Survival rate of fish was highest in T5 followed by T2, T4 and T1. irrespective of species, fish grew faster under treatment T2, followed by T4, T3 and T1.
