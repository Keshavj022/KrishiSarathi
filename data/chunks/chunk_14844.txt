Introduction Climate change adaptation and mitigation (IPCC, 2022), environmental conservation (IPBES, 2019), and renewed attention for food security (Hellegers, 2022) are just some of the priorities societies are increasingly pursuing in the past years. This paper is about the interplay between shifts in societal priorities and changes in agricultural water management to accommodate those shifts. The interplay between societal priorities and ag- ricultural water may appear far-fetched, but is from a water resources per- spective utmost relevant when one combines the insights that i) agriculture is the largest water user accounting for 72 % of the freshwater withdrawals (FAO, 2021), ii) agriculture is responsible for 56 % of volumetric efﬂuent discharged into the environment (FAO, 2021), and iii) water resources are increasingly scarce due to growing demands and climate change, result- ing in ﬁercer competition for water (Vörösmarty et al., 2000). Hence when priorities in society shift from for instance agricultural intensiﬁcation to en- vironmental conservation, or from agricultural expansion to urban growth, changes in agricultural water management become almost a prerequisite to accommodate water-wise the novel priorities as it often involves redistribu- tions of scarce water and improvements in water quality. This interplay is visible in many regions around the world. A scoping study of 21 examples found that agricultural water management is more easily altered to accom- modate agricultural growth priorities of land rehabilitation, expansion, and intensiﬁcation, then to accommodate priorities related to environmental conservation such as biodiversity enhancement, clean river ﬂow, and cap- ping groundwater extraction (Seijger and Hellegers, 2023). The aim of this paper is to increase the understanding how shifts in so- cietal priorities require a certain degree of reform in agricultural water management, by introducing and testing the usefulness of an analytical framework and variables. So far, the concept of reorientation has been de- ﬁned as a shift in broader societal priorities that drives reform of agricul- tural water management. Existing analytical frameworks hold major limitations to analyse a reorientation. First, reform in agricultural water management is not explicitly linked to shifting societal priorities and ob- served changes in agricultural water management (e.g. Molden, 2007; Mollinga et al.
