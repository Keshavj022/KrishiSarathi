 S1(a) shows the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) map of India in 2005, obtained from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration [69]. The map divides the landscape of India into 19 classes (Figs. S1a, b, and c). Because India is an agrarian country, a substantial portion of its land is dedicated to agricultural Fig. 4.

Therefore, we projected the identified solar farms onto the LULC map. We found that a large portion of land that is now used for solar farms was previously used for agricultural crops. Fig. 6 presents a state-by-state depiction of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes, measured in hectares, revealing a predominant trend of agricultural cropland conversion into solar plants across virtually all states. The eight states featured in the figure are those with the highest installed solar capacity in the country, collectively accounting for 86.87 % of the nation’s total solar power generation [70]. Analyses of LULC maps from previous years, specifically from 1995 to 1985 (Fig. 6b, and c), revealed a similar pattern. This pattern indicates the general trend that agricultural land that was previously used for food production has since become a popular choice for solar energy production, highlighting the encroachment of agricultural land. In the context of agricultural practices, soil preparation techniques such as ploughing, leveling, manuring, and weeding play a crucial role in maintaining land quality. When land is leased for solar power installations for extended periods, these routine pro­ cedures may be neglected, potentially leading to a decline in land quality [71]. The Indian government’s “KISAN URJA SURAKSHA EVAM UTTHAN MAHABHIYAN (KUSUM) Yojana” schemes promotes the expansion of solar power, with many farmers choosing to lease their land to companies for periods up to 25 years [72]. The ‘Saur Krushi Vahini Yojana (SKVY)’ scheme offers attractive financial incentives and straightforward eligibility requirements for landowners, providing them with a stable income source [72]. However, long-term solar panel installation on agricultural land may have unintended consequences on land quality, rendering it unsuitable for future farming activities. The absence of regular soil treatments may result in weed proliferation, which could adversely affect the land’s organic content and overall fertility. This potential trade-off between solar energy expansion and agricultural land preservation highlights the need for a balanced and sustainable approach to land use planning in the context of solar power development.
