Known for their resilience, adaptability, and high milk production, buffaloes are a key asset for Punjab’s dairy and agriculture sector. Punjab, often referred to as the 'Granary of India,' is also one of the leading states in milk production, with buffaloes contributing significantly to this achievement. According to the 20th Livestock Census (2019), there were 4.01 million buffaloes in Punjab, representing around 3.65% of the total buffalo population in India. The average daily milk yield was estimated at 9.52 litres, the second highest in the country. Buffaloes are often called 'Black Gold' due to their immense economic and nutritional value, particularly in regions like Punjab where they play a pivotal role in the rural and agricultural economy. Buffaloes contribute to Punjab’s economic, social, and cultural fabric in numerous ways, making them a cornerstone of profitable farming. They produce milk that is rich in fat and protein, highly valued for dairy production, and this higher milk fat yield brings increased profit to farmers. As such, buffaloes are considered a 'goldmine' for milk production, providing consistent income to millions of rural families, especially small and marginal farmers. This steady revenue from milk and dairy products sustains rural economies and brings financial security to those who rely on it. Buffalo farming also promotes women’s empowerment in rural areas, as women often engage in milking, processing, and selling dairy products. Punjab’s prominent buffalo breeds, such as Murrah and Nili-Ravi, are valued for their superior genetic qualities, including high milk production, good disease resistance, and adaptability to various climates. The state has become a hub for buffalo breeding programs, with farmers and breeders focused on enhancing genetic potential to increase milk yields and productivity.
