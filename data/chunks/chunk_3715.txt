 Assam, Sikkim and Mizoram are the major spice growers among the states in NER. Several R Dinesh1*, Lijo Thomas and V Srinivasan spices are grown in these states. The large cardamom (Amomum subulatum Roxb.) output in the country comes almost exclusively from the NER. This region is also a significant producer of spices like black pepper, ginger, turmeric, chillies, garlic, coriander and tejpat. Apart from these, major spices, several minor spices are also produced in limited quantity from this unique production environment. The area, production and productivity of spices along with the major spice crops in various states of NER is given in Table 1. Cultivation of large cardamom is mainly undertaken in the states of Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. About 90% of the large cardamom produced in the country comes from originates from the NER. Sikkim is the largest producer of large cardamom followed by Arunachal Pradesh. The production profile of large cardamom for the year 2021-22 is given in Table 2. Apart from the NER significant production of large cardamom is reported from Technology Table 1.

Among the various spice crops, ginger and turmeric cultivation is spread across all the states of the region. Ginger is the most widely cultivated spice crop in the region. During 2020-21 ginger was cultivated in 66,014 ha with an estimated output of more than five lakh tonnes of fresh ginger. Though the spice crops are widely cultivated in the northeast states, the productivity of most of the crops remains below the national average productivity (Table 4). Except for black pepper, where the NER had higher productivity, the yield level of all other major spice crops was lower than the national average yield levels. The difference in productivity level is also an indication of the latent potential of the spice crops in enhancing the Table 2.
