They concluded that loss of C because of intense mineralization of organic matter under corn cultivation was mainly due to tillage which facilitates oxidation of C. It was also noted that in poplar plantation the surface soil (0–20 cm) was characterized by the labile fraction of C, whereas subsoil (20–100 cm) was characterized by non-oxidizable or recalcitrant C (Baker et al., 2007). Milori et al. (2002) concluded that there was an increased concentration of recalci­ trant C with increasing soil depth. This is the common trait in all forest soils they noticed. This may be due to that complex organic matter build up in lower layer of soil which ultimately contributed to the soil recal­ citrant pool and they got adsorbed due to intra aggregates occlusions in soil mineral matrix with increase in clay content (Mikutta et al., 2006; Denef et al., 2007). Soil aggregates are the main storehouse of C sequestration. Soil ag­ gregation is governed by many factors. Among them are texture, cation content in soils, clay mineralogy, aluminium and iron oxides, and SOM (Abiven et al., 2009). On the other hand, aggregation also stabilizes soil organic C (SOC). Stable aggregates not only promote good crop estab­ lishment and soil physical environment in the root zone but also they are the indicators of favourable soil structure for SOC stabilization and storage (Balesdent et al., 2000). Tillage of arable land leads to breaking of macroaggregates and leads to loss of associated SOC (Gami et al., 2009). As shown in their study, positive relationships between SOC or total N and silt+clay content was found for both forest and cultivated soils for all the soil depths. The form of soil aggregate was determined by the source of C inputs via root or shoot associated with it (Gale et al., 2000; Wander et al., 2000). Change in tillage practices and soil residue management eventually affect soil aggregation and ultimately SOC accumulation rates that are affected by the types and amount of organic matter added to soil. But how aggregate-associated C differs under various land uses of a tropical Alfisol is least understood.
