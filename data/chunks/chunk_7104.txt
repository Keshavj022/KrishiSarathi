11 kg/ha/ year during 2020–2021, showing about a three-fold increase in productivity, thereby improving the socio- economic condition of the fishers. Effluent management in inland saline aquaculture systems: Standardized biofloc-based technology for the Application of biochar in inland saline aquaculture systems: Biochar application in sediment showed enhanced potassium ion and organic carbon (2.17 times) content of the sediment and improved the water quality by reducing ammonium ion concentration and enhancing Ca : Mg ratio in water. Application of potassium enriched sugarcane bagasse biochar in inland saline aquaculture systems at 0.5% level enhanced the K+ in the Penaeus vannamei culture system from an initial value of 46 ppm to 96 ppm in 49 days of culture period. It also enhanced growth performance of Genetically-Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT). ❑ Effluent management in inland saline aquaculture systems 7. Crop Management Crop Production Effect of cutting schedules and rainfall pattern on Cenchrus ciliaris: For evaluating effect of rainfall pattern and cutting schedules on seed quality of C. ciliaris (var. IGFRI 3108) an experiment was conducted from 2018 to 2020 at Avikanagar station of ICAR– IGFRI. The year-wise findings revealed that average seed yield was comparable during 2018 and 2019 (82.8 and 81.4 kg/ha, respectively) but it was very low during 2020 (62.4 kg/ha). Among 3 years, proportion of filled spikelet was more adversely affected due to rainfall pattern during 2019 (26.8%) and least during 2018 (58.2%). Highest ergot formation was also recorded during 2019 (28.5%) and lowest during 2020 (13.9%). Mean germination of spikelet, after 6 months of storage, was observed from 10.4% (2019) to 20.8% (2018). The findings revealed that quantum of rainfall, number of rainy days and their distribution pattern during two weeks before and three weeks after 50% flowering play a crucial role in seed formation and/or fungal infestation (ergot formation) of spikelet. Cutting on 20 August for seed production was found better as compared to rest of cutting schedules as indicated by higher germination of 34.5 (2018) to 17.5% (2019). Higher seed and fodder yield were observed in no cut and the cutting on 20 July, but germination was reduced significantly as compared to cutting on 20 August. Drought mitigation strategies in tobacco: A set of drought management practices involving early planting with tray nursery seedlings, high density planting at 90 cm ×50 cm, starter application of calcium nitrate (CN) @ 25 kg/ha and foliar nutrition of N and K through potassium nitrate spray recorded highest productivity of cured leaf in the FCV tobacco grown in the drought prone areas of Karnataka light soils region of Karnataka. The yield increases of more than 11% was recorded.
