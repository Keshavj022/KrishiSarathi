 The method uses a linear transfer function to correct the bias, as follows: T* his = This(d) + μm(Tobs(d) ) −μm(This(d)) T* fut = Tfut(d) + μm(Tobs(d) ) −μm(This(d)) where T = temperature his = historical run fut = future run obs = station data µ = average m = month d = day * = bias corrected For bias correction, the base period was taken as the 30-year period covering 1975–2004. Future climate projections under two RCPs were considered – RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The climate projections were done into two future periods- Near future (2021–2050) and Mid future (2051–2080). 3.3. Modeling the system to relate climate stressors to performance metrics The first step of CRIDA also involves setting up a water resources system model of the study area. A water resources system model was set up to relate the external climate drivers to the identified performance metrics. Since the system boundary included both the Bhavani basin boundary as well as the part of LBIP command area outside the Bhavani basin, these were modelled separately. For the Bhavani basin, distrib­ uted hydrologic modelling was done using ArcSWAT model and for the rest of the system, crop modeling to simulate yield and crop water re­ quirements, was done using AquaCrop model. 3.3.1. Hydrologic modeling ArcSWAT, a semi-distributed, process-based hydrologic model (Arnold et al., 1998), developed by the USDA Agricultural Research Service and based on the ArcGIS platform, is used in this research. The model simulates hydrologic components and has been widely applied to Table 5 Trend analysis of rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature. Trend statistics Rainfall Max. Temperature Min.
