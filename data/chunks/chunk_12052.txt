Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/ species): CRIDA Mixed Inoculum-I: For drought stress management Pseudomonas putida P7 + Paenibacillus favisporus strain B30 2. Target crops and delivery system: Sorghum, Seed treatment 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): Telāngana 4. Validation and commercialization: Under evaluation at different rain-fed regions of the country. 5. Benefits: An increase of 12-20% in grain yield was observed due to inoculation along with 100% RDF under rainfed conditions in field experiments with sorghum compared to uninoculated control. The inoculum was also tested as seed inoculant in sorghum crop (Rabi season, ~3 ha) at farmers’ fields (village: Utkur, Mahabubnagar Dist.). 6.

Name of the technology and its microbial constituent (Genus/ species): Bacillus aryabhattai MDSR14: A potential rhizobacteria for scavenging native phosphorus and zinc from soil for improved biofortification in Soybean and Wheat Grown in Vertisols 2. Target crops and delivery system: Soybean, Wheat 3. Target agroecological zones (if any): Central Zone or regions with vertisols 4. Validation and commercialization : It has been validated under field conditions on soybean and wheat crops at IISR farm. 5. Benefits: Inoculation of B. aryabhattai strain MDSR14 significantly increases seed yield by 30.7% and 48.0 %, in soybean and wheat crop respectively over un-inoculated control. Similarly, there was an increase of 21.4 % and 36.2 % in shoot Zn content and 37.5 and 42.7 % in seed Zn content, respectively in soybean and wheat crops. The inoculation with this strain increased Zn concentration in wheat up to 60.5 mg kg-1 as against 42.
