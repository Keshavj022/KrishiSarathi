 Web-based decision support system (DSS): The NBSS&LUP in collaboration with Bhaskaracharya Institute for Space Application and Geo-informatics, Department of Science and Technology, Government of Gujarat, Gandhinagar, developed an android-based mobile application on GIS platform to facilitate web- based decision support system (DSS) for land use planning and dissemination of soil health cards information at village and farm level for Gujarat. The main menu of the App contains five options, viz. soil parameter, suitable crops, fertility map of survey number of interest and technologies of ICAR/SAU. Depending on requirement of information, one can select district, taluka and within the taluka desired village, followed by survey number of interest. App will display details of soil map unit information and suggested land use plan for that survey number. LRI based land use planning: The NBSS&LUP is preparing Land Resource Inventory (LRI) of different blocks in the country on 1:10000 scale to work out block level agricultural land use plan. So far, LRI of 99 blocks have been completed. Basudevpur Block, Bhadrak District, Odisha: The Zn deficiency status in soils of AESR 1.2,6.4, 14.1, 14.2 and 16.2 was recorded lesser than 10%, while soils of AESR 7.3, 12.3, 14.2, 14.4, 15.1, 15.3, 16.3, 17.1, 18.3 and 19.1 falls in 10-20% deficiency range. The soils of these regions are mostly acidic in nature containing high organic carbon content and sloppy land. The Zn deficiency is highest (> 50%) in soils of central (AESR 4.4, 10.1, 10.2 and 10.4), western (AESR 2.1 and 2.2) and southern (AESR 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 18.1) parts of India. In general, other AESR region falling in western India (AESR 2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3) are showing acute Zn deficiency as compared to north east, east and extreme northern part of India. The soils of AESR 4.1, 4.2, 7.1, 9.1, 11, 12.1, 12.2, Soil characterization and management Geoportal ‘BHOOMI’ The NBSS&LUP developed NBSS BHOOMI Geo-portal to access various thematic information on major physiographic regions of India, sub-physiographic regions of India, agro-ecological regions (1992), agro- ecological regions (2015) and agro-ecological sub- regions of the country. The point database for benchmark soil information of India for 300 sites, state- wise soil series of India for 18 states (3,795 sites), soil series database for 22 districts (495 sites), grid point data on soil physical and chemical properties of 752 NATP (National Agricultural Technology Projects) sites and soil fertility data (20,7269 sites) were processed and uploaded on Geoportal. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 11 SOIL AND WATER PRODUCTIVITY DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017–18 12 14.5, 18.4 and 19.2, are showing 20-30% Zn deficiency. The B deficiency occurs predominantly in eastern (AESR 12.1,12.2,12.3 and 15.1), north east (15.2 and 16.3) and extreme north (14.1 and 14.3) and south western (6.1, 8.2 and 8.4) parts of the country where soils are acidic in nature.
