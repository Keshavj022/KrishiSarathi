34 ha area under micro and surface irrigation 749.61 m3 and 1,274.15 m3, respectively. The water saving of 41.16% was estimated in micro irrigation as compared to surface irrigation. The simulation study revealed that increased command area or auxiliary water harvesting structure required at experimental site for storing maximum runoff water 230.82 m3, 181.36 m3, and 157.7 m3 in July, August, and September, respectively. The required design of tank capacity was 250 m3 at experimental site for irrigating 0.11 ha area additionally in terms of studied crops grown during kharif + rabi + zaid under micro irrigation system. An apparatus for in situ collection of insect pheromones A sampling apparatus for in situ volatile collection invented by ICAR-VPKAS, Almora was been granted patent (Patent No. 373714). The apparatus was successfully utilized to collect the pheromone of scarab beetle/chafer beetle/white-grub beetle, Holotrichia seticollis (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Melolonthinae). Holotrichia seticollis is one of the predominant white- grub species in Uttarakhand (Almora) but do not get attracted to light. This less-phototactic nature of H. seticollis makes light trap not effective for its management. However, the pheromone extracted from H. seticollis using the above apparatus was effective in trapping H. seticollis males in the field aid in pest management. Crop Protection In vitro evaluation of Trichoderma isolate Tr-202 against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lentis: The antagonistic potential of Trichoderma isolate Tr-202 were assessed against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lentis through dual culture technique. Trichoderma isolate Tr-202 showed significantly higher inhibition (72.2%) as compared to commercialized Trichoderma isolate Tr-28 (65.5%).The 550 bp ITS gene fragment of both the Trichoderma isolates (Tr-28 and Tr-202) were sequenced and the sequence were deposited in NCBI GenBank. A phylogenetic analysis-based on the ITS region was performed, the maximum parsimony analysis of ITS gene confirmed, both the isolates as T. harzianum.
