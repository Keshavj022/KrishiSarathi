Ovaprim, Ovatide, Gonopro FH etc. In case of pituitary extract, the females are given two doses of injection of 2-3 mg/kg and 4-6 mg/kg at an interval of 6-8 h, whereas males are given single dose of 2-3 mg/kg. However, with commercial hormone, single dose of 0.4-0.5 ml/kg to female and 0.2-0.3 ml/kg to male, is given.  In the present practice of induced breeding in circular echo-hatchery, the ratio of female to male is maintained at 1:1.
