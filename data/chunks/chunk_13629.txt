 Waterborne diseases (sanitary circle wise) Waterborne diseases are most prevalent in the north to south-eastern and south- western parts of city during both seasons (Fig. 10) [29,67]. During PRM season, the diseases were more dominant in sanitary circle number 4, 6, 7 and 8 with the total number of 866, 822,784 and 756 patients respectively. Ward wise Shah Jamal recorded maximum waterborne diseases, followed by Begum Bagh, Nagla Jamalpur, Jiwangarh and Bhamola with 384, 333, 325, 292 and 287 patients sequentially. There is a slight change in number of reported waterborne diseases during POM season. Sanitation circle number 2 showed maximum number of patients, followed by 4, 5 and 6 with 726, 677, 674 and 661 numbers of patients respectively. Ward wise POM data also varied from Table 6 Decadal reported water borne diseases.

Pala Sahibabad was reported with most affected people in POM season, then Shah Jamal, Nagla Kalar, Begum Bagh, Nai Basti and Bhamola serially and these wards also recorded 321, 302, 282, 274 and 242 number of persons with waterborne diseases. 3.6.4. Waterborne diseases susceptibility assessment and mapping The major goal of this work was to use chemical characteristics in groundwater, water quality index, and a spatial database of waterborne diseases to find a link between water quality index and waterborne diseases [68]. Thus, using map algebra, the chemical parameter maps were merged into a single raster layer and classified into three categories for drinking purposes: acceptable, moderately acceptable, poorly acceptable. Similarly, the water quality index geographical map was also divided into three categories: good water, average water, poor water quality and the reported instances of waterborne disease from circle were divided into very low to very high disease prevalence [52]. The output raster layer of chemical parameters in groundwater was classed by assigning a numerical value between 1 and 3, with 1 indiÂ­ cating acceptable for drinking purposes and 3 indicating poorly acceptable for drinking purposes [39].
