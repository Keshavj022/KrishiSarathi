 Evaluation of different botanical formulations for management of sucking pest complex in mango revealed that for Karnataka, Panjab, Gujarat and Maharashtra neem soap spray @ 10 g/l (five sprays at 15 days interval starting from panicle initiation) was the most effective, whereas, in West Bengal and Telangana application of azadirachtin 10,000 ppm @ 3 g/l (five sprays at 15 days interval starting from panicle initiation) was the most effective and for Uttarakhand a combination treatment comprising first spray of azadirachtin 10,000 ppm @ 3 ml/l at panicle initiation stage followed by second spray of neem soap @ 10 g/l followed by third spray of pongamia soap @ 10 g/l followed by forth spray of aavya @ 4 g/l at 15 days interval was the most effective for management of sucking pest complex in mango. Algorithm for rhinoceros beetle: An algorithm based on object detection approach with an accuracy of 84.3% for surveillance of rhinoceros beetle infestation in coconut using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been developed. Inflorescence pests of cashew: A total of 67 species were documented on cashew inflorescences. Damage symptoms, seasonal incidence and influence of weather factor on pests, natural enemies for different pests were also documented. Reduction in nut set up to 47.06 % has been recorded in NRCC Sel-2 due to damage by the inflorescence pests. Eight botanical formulations/ preparations comprising aqueous leaf or seed extracts tested against flower caterpillars and TMB showed no effective management like insecticidal treatment. Weather based prediction model for cucurbit fruit fly: The cucurbit fruit fly, Zeugodacus (=Bactrocera) cucurbitae (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a polyphagous and a major pest of cucurbitaceous vegetables. Six year mean data on adult fruit fly caught in cue-lure traps installed in different cucurbits revealed that there were two major peaks of fruit fly incidence in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, i.e. the first (90.33 adult fruit fly/ trap) occurred during last week of March (13 standard meteorological week-SMW) and the second (96 adult fruit fly/trap) during third week of November (46 SMW). The maximum temperature (r =+0.447**), sunshine hour (r= +0.448**) and evaporation rate (r= +0.439**) showed highly significant positive correlations with this fruit fly abundance in the region whereas, morning and evening relative humidity (r= -0.570** and r= -0.724**), rainfall (r= -0.266*) and wind velocity (r= -0.08) adversely affect the population build up. Based on stepwise forward regression, it was observed that maximum temperature played significant role explaining 25.2% fruit fly abundance followed by minimum temperature sharing 20.1% abundance. Morning relative humidity accorded 13.1% share of ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 85 spp., is a migratory endoparasite and causes typical brown lesions in the root and rhizomes, the economical part of turmeric crop.
