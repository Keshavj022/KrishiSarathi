 The food materials in 10 replicates were tested organoleptically (sensory method) by a panel of 10 judges selected from the villagers as well as scientists of the university using 9â€“point Hedonic Rating scale. Selection of judges was done out of 30 persons (experts and experienced) by providing them different concentrations of chief ingredients. The persons having average scores were selected. The parameters included in the study were colour, aroma or flavour, taste and overall acceptability. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Assessing different preparations of munga sag An attempt was made in this study to assess different preparations using munga leaves and flowers. For matrix scoring, 6 different preparations were taken into account. Table 1 shows that vegetable of munga leaves scored higher than of the flowers. Fresh leaves of munga Table 1.

Except sale value, all other properties were favourable for the preparations made from the leaves. Table 2.

The mean scores for organoleptic characteristics reveal that cooked vegetable of fresh leaves of munga prepared with oil, tomatoes that all preparations of dry flowers of munga are also organoleptically acceptable. Laboratory studies Laboratory analysis for estimation of the and spices were very high (7.33) in comparison to vegetables of dry leaves, fresh flowers and dry flowers. Most of the organoleptic characteristics of vegetable of fresh leaves were rated high, ranging from 7 to 8 scores. It is also evident that vegetable of fresh flower of munga was also organoleptically rated high, (i.e. 8, 6 and 6) in terms of colour, aroma and taste, respectively. However, vegetable of dry flowers was rated poorly (i.e. 4, 5 and 5) in terms of colour, aroma and taste respectively than other preparations. Mean scores on overall acceptability indicated chemical composition of leaves of munga was done. Results are presented in Table 4.
