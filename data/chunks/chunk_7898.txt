 A process-based climatic phenology model (ILCYM), revealed that the changing climates will be more favorable for Bactrocera zonata, and its damage potential will progressively increase in all mango-producing regions of India where the pest already prevails. The spatial and temporal changes in voltinism of three major mango fruit fly species, viz. Bactrocera dorsalis, Bactrocera correcta and Bactrocera zonata were estimated in major mango regions of India. Increased number of generations across 10 mango-growing locations of India suggested that incidence of fruit flies may increase due to projected increase in temperatures in future climate change scenario. Under balanced fertilization in soybean and wheat, change in soil organic C in soil depth of 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm was nonsignificant in all RCPs and time slices. This result agreed well with the change in grain yield of soybean and wheat. In year 2050, soybean yield will increase by 12, 17, 15 and 22% in RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5, respectively. The result showed that soybean yield increase will be more in year 2080 than that in year 2050. The increase in wheat yield would be 2-4% over base in year 2050, whereas 1-6% in the year 2080. Supplementation of tamarind seed husk alone or in combination with soapnut significantly reduced in vivo methane emission (22-24%) and decreased the population of rumen protozoa and methanogens. Feeding of tree leaves (Leucenea leucocephala and Ficus) based complete feed resulted in 9.8-18.93% reduction in enteric methane emission (g/day) in goats in comparison to traditional complete feed. A herbal crude powder based bolus, consisting of three plant materials, reduced climatic stress in goats. Examination of the whole transcriptome changes in indigenous (Mali) and exotic (Hampshire) pigs during summer and winter, revealed that indigenous Mali pigs recorded only 14 upregulated and 45 downregulated genes in response to change in ambient temperature indicating better adaptation in them. Genetic resources: Total 21 explorations were undertaken and 1,532 germplasm accessions were collected comprising 1,095 of cultivated plants and 437 wild accessions. The explorations were undertaken two each in Andhra Pradesh, Asom, Chhattissgarh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and one each in Andaman and Nicobar, Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Nagaland, Odisha, Tripura and Uttarakhand. The population of Momordica cochinchinensis, collected from the middle Andaman Island, was described as a new subspecies Momordica cochinchinensis subsp. andamanica, which was subsequently validated through DNA barcoding. During the period, 411 herbarium specimens were added to the National Herbarium of Cultivated Plants. Out of 28,516 accessions, imported from 39 countries, 2,911 OVERVIEW DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017â€“18 3 were screened against biotic and 787 against abiotic stresses, and 7,343 were supplied for research use and crop improvement programme within the country.
