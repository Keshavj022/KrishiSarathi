However, wild animals have posed a significant threat to maize, the main crop. The Farmer FIRST Programme (FFP) at SKUAST-Jammu demonstrated the benefits of cultivating okra as an alternative to maize, which is less susceptible to wild animal damage due to its spiny texture. Through extensive training and demonstration activities, farmers were encouraged to adopt okra cultivation. This shift has yielded higher net incomes and sparked interest among farmers in neighbouring areas. The program has successfully shown the economic and ecological benefits of replacing maize with okra in regions vulnerable to wild animal interference. Keywords: Farmer FIRST, Okra cultivation, Sustainable agriculture, Wild animals T HE Samba district of Jammu and Kashmir has diverse agro-climatic conditions, and for the majority of farmers, agriculture is their primary source of livelihood. Maize (Zea mays) is the main crop, cultivated on an area of 3,904 ha. However, in recent years, maize cultivation has become less profitable due to a significant threat from wild animals over the past five years. The Farmer FIRST Programme (FFP) has supported the farmers of Daruie village in the Nud block of Samba by promoting okra cultivation using scientific methods, allowing them to adopt okra as a replacement for maize. Okra is less attractive to wild animals due to the spines on the plant. Through the FFPâ€™s demonstration and promotion efforts, farmers have been convinced to cultivate okra in areas where they previously grew maize. Maize-wheat is the primary cropping pattern and source of livelihood for the farmers at the project site under rainfed farming conditions. The average landholding of these farmers was 10.6 kanals, from which they were able to harvest yields for family consumption. The village is situated near a forested area, making it vulnerable to crop damage from wild animals.
