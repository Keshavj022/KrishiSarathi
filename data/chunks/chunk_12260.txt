Suitability of the variety for the area (Recommended : Timely sown irrigated conditions of Punjab, area for which variety has been released/ Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan (except Kota and recommended) Udaipur divisions), western UP (except Jhansi division), parts of J&K (Jammu and Kathua districts), parts of Himachal Pradesh (Una district and Paonta valley) and Uttarakhand (tarai region). 2. Selection of field/land preparation (Type of topography, : Flat fertile soil, pre-sowing irrigation followed by soil condition, tillage operations for seed bed etc.) ploughing with disc harrow, tiller and leveller at field capacity for optimum field conditions 3. Seed treatment (Recommended chemical with doses) : Vitavax @ 2.0 gm/kg seed 4. Sowing time (Optimum sowing period) : November 10-20 5. Seed Rate/sowing method–line sowing with row-to- : 100 kg/ha line sowing with row-to-row distance row and plant-to-plant distance of 20cm and plant-to-plant 5 cm 6. Fertilizer Doses & time of fertilizer’s application : 150:60:40 (N:P:K); 1/3 N at sowing and 2/3 at (Type and quantity of fertilizers) first node stage i.e. 35-40 DAS 7. Weed Control (Name of weedicide(s) with dosages : For the control of broad-leaved weeds 2,4-D and timing of mechanical weeding, if any) at 500 g/ha or metsulfuron at 4 g/ha or carfentrazone at 20 g/ha can be sprayed using about 250 litres of water/ha • For the control of grasses isoproturon at 1,000 g or clodinafop at 60 g or fenoxaprop 100g or sulfosulfuron at 25 g/ha should be used. In isoproturon resistant P. minor infested areas clodinafop or fenoxaprop or sulfosulfuron can be used • For the control of complex weed flora, combination of isoproturon with 2,4-D or metsulfuron or sulfosulfuron with metsulfuron can be applied at 30-35 DAS at sufficient soil moisture 8. Major disease and pest control (Type of Pest : The variety is resistant to stripe and leaf rust and and disease with name of chemicals and dosages other diseases. However, for stripe rust, leaf l& timing of application) rust, Karnal bunt and powdery mildew, apply propiconazole/ triademefone/tebucanazole at 0.1% (1ml/litre) as foliar spray twice after disease appearance at 15 days interval 9.
