Source: https://seednet.gov.in (Accessed on 09.01.2024) Yield and yield gap packages of practices adopted in CFLDs compared to To demonstrate the potential yields of three leading varieties of mothbean viz. RMO-2251, RMO-435 and RMO-257, demonstrations were organised at farmers’ fields. Average yield of 551 kg/ha and net return of %17516/ha was obtained with improved varieties and 414 kg/ha yield and %12537/ha net return under farmers’ practices. The yield gap between the yields of CFLDs and that of farmers practice was 34.7% (137 kg/ha) (Table 3 and 4). Table 3. Performance of mothbean varieties during Kharif 2022 in Rajasthan (n=794).
