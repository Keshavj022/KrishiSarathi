 For an overall development, the horticulturists have thus embarked on the following charter: with cultivable area penetrating into wastelands, apart from breeding of improved cultivars of the arid crops, conservation and management of soil water through well-tested micro-irrigation systems and moisture- conservation techniques have to be evolved concomitantly widening the existing choice of horticulture-based cropping/farming systems for different agroclimates conducting need-specific research on protected cultivation of export- oriented vegetables and flowers tackling disease problems of national importance — mango malformation, guava-wilt, citrus decline, spongy tissue in mango, bunchy top in banana, root-wilt in coconut, citrus and pepper, Phytophthora and mycoplasma diseases of horticultural crops standardization of appropriate biotechniques for genetic manipulation — introduction of desirable traits for yield, quality and stress tolerance — and, micropropagation through tissue culture in crops of importance for mass production of quality planting material development of integrated pest management systems to reduce the cost of inputs, lessen environmental pollution and to avoid problems of pesticide residues strengthening of research on the tropical oil palm and the temperate olive in order to improve the contribution of horticultural crops to the total edible oil produced in the country advancing in hybrid technology, particularly for the vegetable crops. plant protection An in-built component of crop improvement research and its various disciplines, plant-protection research is both a part of crop research institutes and the All- India Coordinated Crop Improvement Projects of the ICAR. The emphasis is increasingly on an integrated approach: manipulation of the variety for builtin resistance; modification of agronomic practices to evade or reduce pest incidence; safe and efficient methods of pest control through pest survey and monitoring and biological control through pest’s natural enemies — parasitoids, predators and pathogens. The target-specific alndia coordinated research projects in operation are: Control, Bangalore, houses the largest collection of parasitoids and @ Biological control of crop pests and weeds predators and their host insects in ‘ the country. @ Nematode pests and their management The Project Directorate of Biological Control, Bangalore, is also the nodal @ Rodent control agency for import of exotic natural enemies. They have all been colonized @ White-grub management @ Seed-borne diseases (as part of the National Seeds Project) @ Agricultural ornithology @ Honeybee research and training The inexpensive moth collection @ Agricultural acarology assembly has made the task of moth collection rather easy and @ Pesticide residues quick. It has also spared the collector from inhaling scales Dr S.P. Singh and his colleagues from the Project Directorate of In the computerized environmental chambers, Mr S.K.
