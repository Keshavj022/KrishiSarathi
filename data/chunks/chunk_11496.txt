 The recommended dose of 100-120 kg N, 50-60 kg P and 50-60 kg K should be applied for timely sown wheat while 80:40:40 kg NPK/ha should be applied for the late sown wheat. Half of the N and full P and K should be applied as a basal dose at the time of sowing while remaining half N should be applied at the time of first irrigation (18-20 DAS). The rainfed wheat can be fertigated with 40 kg N and 20 kg N as a basal dose. The crop should be protected from stem borer by spraying Cypermethrin 10 EC @ 11 ml per 10 lit waters if infestation is observed. Rabi Sorghum: Rabi sorghum crop should be sown on residual moisture after harvest of green gram, black gram, or Soybean. Rainfed Rabi sorghum should be sown during 15th September to 1st October while the under irrigated situation the crop may be sown up to 31st October. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 307 The recommended spacing of 45 cm x 12.5 cm should be followed for higher yield; the seeds should be treated with fungicide and Gaucho insecticide @ 4 g / kg of seed for the control of stem borer. A recommended dose of 80:40:40 kg NPK should be applied to Rabi sorghum of which half N and full P and K should be applied as a basal dose while half of the N should be applied after 30 DAS. Improved varieties like Parbhani Moti, Parbhani Super Moti, Phule Vasudha, Phule Revati, PKV Kranti, etc should be used for higher yield. Safflower: The rainfed safflower crop should be sown on residual moisture during 1st October to 15th October. Irrigated safflower can be sown up to 15th November. A recommended spacing of 45 x 20 cm should be followed for better yield. The crop stand should be maintained by thinning of crop after two weeks from sowing for maintaining the desired plant population. Improved varieties like PBN-12, PBN-46, PBN-40 (non-spiny), PKV Pink (AKS-311), NARI-6 (non-spiny), NARI NH-1 (non- spiny) should be used. The crop should be protected from the attack of aphids by using 5 % NSKE or Dimethoate 30 EC 10 ml per 10 lit of water. Linseed: Use improved high yielding and short duration varieties of linseed like Latur-93, NL-97, etc. Use recommended spacing of 30 cm x 15 cm and 10 kg seed/ha. Finish the sowing before 15th October. A recommended dose of fertiliser 50 kg N and 25 kg P should be applied, out of which 50 % N should be applied at the time of sowing and 25 kg after one month of sowing as a top dressing should be applied. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 308 Timely plant protection measures should be followed as per recommendations. Mustard: Mustard can be sown in Maharashtra in the first fortnight of November. Improved varieties like Shatabdi (CAN-9), TPM-1, etc should be used with 5 kg seed rate per hectare. The sowing should be done at 45 cm x 20 cm spacing. The crop should be protected from powdery mildew by spraying of Carbendazim @ 10 g per 10 lit of water or wettable sulphur @ 20 g per 10 lit of waterand timely irrigation should be provided.
