 The bags protected the fruits from physical damage and losses due to pests, fruit drop, and adverse weather conditions, leading to an overall increase in marketable yield and fetching higher prices in the market. Table 1. Physico-chemical parameters of bagged Dashehari fruits Quality Unbagged fruit Bagged fruit Fruit weight 220-350 220-400 Length (mm) 35-40 35-60 Width (mm) 75-120 80-120 Total soluble solids (°Brix) 22-25 25-27 Number of ‘A’ grade fruits (%) 15-30 40-50 Titratable acidity (%) 0.22-0.20 0.18-0.25 Though fruit bagging was initially demonstrated on 200 farms by providing critical inputs, a total of 1,860 farmers adopted the technology in Malihabad, covering 235 ha of Dashehari mango orchards. The concentrated efforts of ICAR-CISH through its Farmers FIRST Programme and cluster development under the MIDH- funded project have led to greater adoption among farmers. Community-based organizations like Awadh Aam Utpadak Evam Bagwani Samiti, Nabipanah, and farmer producer companies like IRADA Foundation, Malihabad, were instrumental in the widespread dissemination of bagging technology in the Central Uttar Pradesh cluster. Around 5 million bags were purchased by farmers for adopting this technology. Shree Rajdhani Fruit Company, Malihabad, provided bags to farmers with a buy-back arrangement. Branding of bagged Dashehari mangoes as 'Milky White Dashehari' in domestic markets around the country was done by Shree Rajdhani Fruit Company, Malihabad, Lucknow. Farmers sold bagged mangoes at `120/kg (`700-800 per 5 kg box) in distant markets. Three tonnes of bagged mangoes were exported to the USA through Innova Agri Bio Park, Malur, Karnataka. The average selling price of bagged mangoes was `86/kg, compared to `40/kg for non-bagged mangoes in local markets. This demonstrates that farmers achieved a 114% higher price for mangoes by using GAP technologies. Farmers realized a net incremental return of `31,333/t, indicating that bagged mangoes were more profitable than non- bagged mangoes (Table 2). Western Uttar Pradesh cluster: The Chousa mango variety is affected by several pests (hopper, thrips, semiloopers) during developmental stages and diseases (shoulder browning and anthracnose) at fruit maturity. To control these, farmers in the Siyana mango belt have been spraying pesticides 5-6 times, leading to high production costs and the risk of residues in fruits. Demonstrating fruit bagging at the marble stage reduced the number of sprays from 5-6 to 1-2 and improved mango quality in terms of colour development. None of the bagged mango fruits were affected by the unusual heat waves that prevailed during the 2024 mango production season. The bags protected the fruits from physical damage, pest losses, fruit drop, and adverse weather conditions, leading to an overall increase in marketable yield.
