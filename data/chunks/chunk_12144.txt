DARE/ICAR works closely with 12 of the CG Centres through agreements/work plans with the approval of Government of India. This first agreements were signed with CIMMYT and IRRI in the year 1974 (Table 1). The broad areas of research collaboration with CGIAR system involves: enhanced cooperation in the areas of priority besides genetic improvement, germplasm supply, technology development to achieve targeted crop and animal productivity and quality in India, focused strategies for joint efforts to address the issues like utilization of rice fallows, agroforestry and watershed development, rainfed/dry land agriculture and water management, and fish breeding protocols. 7 Table 1: Status of MoA /MoU and Work plan with CG Centres S.No. Name of CG Centre Agreement Date Active Work Plan Period 1.

For instance, improved lines of wheat from CIMMYT and of rice from IRRI, which were rigorously evaluated by the Indian scientists at various locations in the country to identify best lines and develop crop management practices suitable to local conditions, contributed to Indiaâ€™s Green Revolution.
