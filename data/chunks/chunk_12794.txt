 Production of vegetable seeds and disease/pest free planting materials by public sector for reducing cost Rigorous monitoring of seed supply chain to provide good quality seeds at cheaper rates, especially seeds of vegetable crops, by enhancing seed production at public institutions and Universities to minimize the cost of cultivation and increased seed replacement rate (SRR).   Ensuring availability of quality seeds of the improved varieties particularly in case of chickpea, lentil, barley, bajra, Pigeonpea and groundnut in seed chain for which Universities and public institutions will have to share the responsibility in popularizing the improved varieties by seed production and making them available to the farmers at reasonable rates and also for rigorous monitoring in seed supply chain for increasing seed replacement rate.   Creation of sugarcane seed village hubs with rapid seed multiplication technique for seed production and promotion of seed production at sugar mill farms.   Creation of community-based low energy vegetable seed village hubs to increase availability of quality seed materials.   Fodder seed production particularly in Western Plain zone in order to cater the needs of fodder seed, particularly Berseem and Lucerne to the other parts of the State. 8. Crop residue management Abolish crop residue burning, promote conservation agriculture, utilization of farm waste by adoption of low- cost technology for ermin-compost preparation, emphasis on soil microbial inoculants development by the rural youths.   Promotion of combine bailing technology through mobile feed block technique and urea treatment of crop residue for producing quality dry fodder and adoption of zero tillage technology for handling crop residue.   Adoption of conservation agriculture for improving soil organic matter and reducing production cost by 25-30% by reducing the number of tillage operations, combining several operations together and increasing production by 15-20% through placement of seeds and fertilizer. Crop residue to be used as mulch to reduce water losses.   Entrepreneurship development among rural youth for establishing low-cost compost unit and soil microbial inoculant- cum-bio-fertilizer unit through the intervention of KVKs and State Department of Agriculture. 618 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Strategy Action Plan 9. Adoption of integrated farming system (IFS) models involving crop horticulture, livestock and fisheries to enhance farm income and ensure risk mitigation mechanism, particularly for small/marginal farmers and also Incentivization to cluster based farming.   Adoption of integrated farming system models for recycling of resources and by-products, reducing dependence of inputs like fertilizer from external sources and generating round the year employment for farmers’ family members.
