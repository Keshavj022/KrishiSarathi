 Credit inadequacy in the farm sector has long been felt, even before the introduction of the green revolution in the country - and several 1Foodgrains, edible oil, sugar, fruits & vegetables, spices, milk, eggs, meat and fish, aggregated using foodgrain equivalent unit prices as weight. Indian Agriculture after Independence 388 interventions have been made to address the demand. The Cooperative Societies Act passed in 1904 and subsequent reforms through the Maclagan Committee on Cooperation in 1915; the examination of rural credit program by the Royal Commission on Agriculture in 1926- 27; Sir Malcolm Darling’s report on cooperative credit to the Government of India in 1935 are the examples. Even then, almost entire credit requirements of the farmers were observed to be financed by the money lenders, and the formal agencies like cooperatives had a minor role. In the year 1951, the money lenders financed around 70% of the cultivators’ credit requirements (Table 4). Not more than 3.3% of the farmers accessed their credit needs through the cooperatives. The access to finance through the commercial banks was still worse, less than a percent. The practice of capital and input-intensive agriculture since the adoption of green revolution technologies in the mid-1960s and the technology spillover to the rest of the regions accelerated the need for further finance for agriculture. In the year 1974, following the concept of ‘priority sector lending’ that comprised agriculture, the commercial banks were advised to raise the share of these sectors in their aggregate advances to the level of 33.33% by March 1979. Further efforts were done by attaching each district with a commercial Lead Bank. The Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) were set up following the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee in 1976. In the year 1982, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) was established. The NABARD undertook the agricultural credit-related functions of the Reserve Bank of India and refinancing functions of the Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation. Table 4.
