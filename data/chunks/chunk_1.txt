KVKs serve as knowledge and resource centres in agricultural technology dissemination, aimed at improving the livelihoods of farmers by bridging the gap between researchers and farmers. The primary objective of KVKs is to provide agricultural extension services to farmers, including training, demonstration, and frontline advisory services, to enhance agricultural productivity and income. KVKs undertake various activities such as conducting on-farm trials, organizing training programs for farmers and extension personnel, demonstrating improved agricultural technologies, providing advisory services, and organizing field days and exhibitions. KVKs play a crucial role in transferring agricultural technologies developed by research institutions to farmers’ fields. They serve as hubs for disseminating knowledge on modern agricultural practices and technologies. KVKs collaborate with various stakeholders including agricultural universities, research institutions, government departments, NGOs, and local communities to maximize their outreach and impact. KVKs also focus on capacity building of extension personnel, agripreneurs, rural youth and women in agriculture through skill development and training programs. Overall, Krishi Vigyan Kendras play a vital role in empowering farmers with knowledge and resources to adopt sustainable and modern agricultural practices, thereby contributing to agricultural development and rural livelihood improvement in India.
