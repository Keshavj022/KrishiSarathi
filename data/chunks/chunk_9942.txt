The field demonstrations showed 35.3% higher yields, more number of harvests (18-21), reduced cost of cultivation, and almost 58.8% higher returns than check varieties. During 2021-22, these hybrids were spread to nearly 14,000 ha area and mostly targeted for bacterial wilt infected areas and for summer cultivation. To meet the higher demand of its seed, a total of 14 licenses were issued resulting in revenue realization of Rs. 42 lakh up to 2021-22.

Enhancement of Nutritional outcome In India, at least 32.1% of the children below 5 years are underweight and stunted, while 57% of women and 33.9% of men in age group 15-49 years are anaemic. The malnutrition significantly cost India in terms of lower productivity, illness, death and overall poor human development. Crop biofortification is one of the sustainable and cost-effective approach to address the malnutrition particularly among the undernourished population. Only one biofortified crop variety was released till 2013-14 and to fill the void, ICAR with needed policy support accelerated the efforts to develop biofortified varieties of crops. Now, ICAR released 87 nutrition-rich and high yielding cultivars of important crops like rice, wheat, maize, pearl millet, finger millet, small millet, lentil, groundnut, linseed, mustard, soybean, cauliflower, potato, sweet potato, greater yam and pomegranate till date. These cultivars have higher essential nutrients viz., iron, zinc, calcium, protein, lysine, tryptophan, provitamin-A, anthocyanin, vitamin-C, oleic acid and linoleic acid but lower anti-nutritional factors. yy Biofortified varieties released: During 2021-22, 15 biofortified varieties of Wheat (5), Rice (1), Maize (3), Pearl millet (1), Mustard (3), and Soybean (2) Freshwater prawn CIFA-GI Scampi 6 DARE–ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2021-22 have been released taking the tally of biofortified varieties in the country to 87.
