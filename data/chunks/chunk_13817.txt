 Its ability to infect olive roots, stems, and also, fruits highlights the risk posed by this species on olive trees. From clade 1, P. cactorum was also reported to cause root rot in olive plantations. This species is a highly invasive and polyphagous pathogen known to thrive in diverse climates, from tropical to temperate, where it causes severe diseases in various agricultural and forestry crops [52,53]. Moreover, two species from clade 6, P. megasperma and P. gonapodyides, were detected. P. megasperma was ﬁrst isolated from young olive trees (less than 10 years old) in Spain in 1997 [54] and has since been linked to olive disease in Spain [22,54,55], Italy, Tunisia, and Iran [40,41,56,57]. Its widespread distribution and persistence in olive- growing regions emphasize its relevance as a root rot pathogen. There have been no previous reports regarding an association between P. gonapodyides and olive trees. However, this study revealed for the ﬁrst time that the species is present in olive plantations in Morocco. This ﬁnding indicates that the species may be involved in root rot disease progression. Nevertheless, this oomycete has been reported to cause root rot and stem cankers in various forest trees and crops, including holm oak in Spain [58], beech in Sweden and Italy [59,60], apple in China [61], and raspberry in Canada [62]. P. gonapodyides has a prevalently aquatic lifestyle and is frequently recovered from streams and riparian ecosystems as an opportunistic pathogen [63]. In contrast, few studies have documented the role of Pythium s.l. species in causing root rot in olive trees worldwide. In this study, we have identiﬁed three species associated with the disease, including P. aphanidermatum, P. irregulare, and P. schmitthenneri. Among these, P. aphanidermatum has previously been associated with the branch wilting and dieback of olive trees in Egypt, Jordan, and the north of Iran [24,57,64]. Similarly, P. irregulare has been reported on olive in Spain, where it was associated with root necrosis, root rot, wilting, and the rapid death of the trees in waterlogging conditions [36,54]. These two Pythium s.l. species were widely known to cause root rot in a range of crops, including tomato [65], stevia [66], onion [67], bell pepper [68], as well as apple and citrus trees [69]. Notably, our study also identiﬁed P. schmitthenneri as a causative agent of root rot in olive plantations. This ﬁnding conﬁrms our earlier work, in which P. schmitthenneri was ﬁrst reported as a pathogen of olive trees in Morocco [28]. Following Koch’s postulates, the pathogenicity of the 10 oomycete species isolated from olive samples was tested on olive saplings under greenhouse conditions. The results Agriculture 2025, 15, 435 11 of 15 demonstrated that all tested Phytophthora and Pythium s.l. isolates were capable of inducing a range of disease symptoms, which, in severe cases, led to plant death.
