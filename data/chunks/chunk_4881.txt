 These sensors can be embedded in packaging materials or integrated into storage facilities, providing real-time data that can be analyzed for effective decision-making. Meanwhile, quantum computing holds the potential to process complex datasets rapidly, enabling advanced predictive modeling and optimization of postharvest logistics. By harnessing the power of quantum algorithms, stakeholders can simulate and analyze multiple scenarios simultaneously, leading to more effective strategies for minimizing waste and enhancing product quality. Integration of 5G and edge computing for real- time decision making: The integration of 5G and edge computing technologies is set to revolutionize real-time decision-making in postharvest management. With the advent of 5G networks, the speed and capacity of data transmission will increase dramatically, allowing for seamless communication between IoT devices deployed throughout the supply chain. Edge computing, which involves processing data closer to the source rather than relying solely on centralized data centers, will facilitate real-time analytics and responsiveness. This real-time capability is crucial for maintaining the integrity of perishable products and ensuring that stakeholders can respond proactively to any challenges that arise during transportation and storage. Digital twin technology: Digital twin technology represents a transformative approach in the field of postharvest management for horticultural crops. At its core, a digital twin is a virtual model that mirrors a physical object or system, utilizing real-time data to simulate, analyze, and optimize its performance. In postharvest management, this technology enhances efficiency, reduces waste, and improves the overall quality of produce during critical stages such as storage and transportation. In addition to real-time monitoring, digital twins harness the power of predictive analytics and ability to optimize processes. This analysis helps identify the most efficient practices, which not only reduces waste but also enhances the overall productivity of the supply chain. Moreover, digital twins can serve as sophisticated decision support systems, providing actionable insights to stakeholders. Digital twins provide actionable data for exporters, retailers, and consumers, such as the remaining shelf-life for each shipment, on which logistics decisions and marketing strategies can be based. The twins also help CNN-XgBoost based ripening identification in banana Novemberâ€“December 2024 49 diagnose and predict potential problems in supply chains that will reduce food quality and induce food loss. Twins can even suggest preventive shipment-tailored measures to reduce retail and household food losses.
