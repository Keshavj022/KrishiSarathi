 In-house drone Irrigation water management system â€¢ Development of IoT enabled irrigation scheduling system for field crops: IoT (Internet of Things) based Irrigation Water Management System (IWMS) was developed and tested in wheat and chickpea to Indian Farming 33 June 2023 Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) developed a digital platform for agricultural extension system named as KISAN SARATHI-System of Agri- information Resources Auto-transmission and Technology Hub Interface. This has been developed to support this emerging need of multi ways and multilingual communication among various agricultural stakeholders. The ultimate goal of this project is to implement an intelligent online platform for supporting agriculture at local niche with national perspective. A total of 731 KVKs are enrolled with the system, where more than 3,600 agricultural scientists and subject matter experts are registered with Kisan Sarathi. The services of Kisan Sarathi for the farmers is available through an IVR based calling system via toll free numbers 1800-123-2175 and a short number 14426. More than 65 Lacs farmers are registered on this portal. Climate smart agriculture Digitalization is rapidly transforming the agriculture sector, and climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is no exception. Digital technologies can help farmers make better decisions, increase productivity and reduce the environmental impact of agriculture. Some of the important area of digitalization related to above field are weather monitoring and forecasting, precision farming, crop management, market access, data management, and farm management. Digitalization in CSA is still in its early stages, and there are challenges to overcome, such as the digital divide in rural areas and the cost of technology. However, the potential benefits are significant, and digitalization can play a vital role in making agriculture more sustainable and resilient in the face of climate change. Supply chain management Digitalization is transforming supply chain management in agriculture by improving transparency, traceability and efficiency. There are number of ways by which digitalization is quite beneficial for supply chain management in the field of agriculture. Digital technologies can capture and store data at the farm level, such as crop yields, soil health, and pesticide use. This information can help supply chain managers better understand the origin and quality of the produce they are sourcing. However, there are challenges to overcome, such as the cost of technology and the need for standardization across the industry. Nonetheless, the potential benefits of digitalization in agriculture supply chain management are significant, and it is an area that is likely to see continued growth and innovation in the years to come.
