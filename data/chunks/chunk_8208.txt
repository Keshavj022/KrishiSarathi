 Hence, wide-area management strategies are advised to restrict or slow down its incidence and population dynamics. Modelling and forecasting establishment of bioagent Zygogramma bicolorata: A study was conducted to model and forecast establishment of Zygogramma bicolorata (a bioagent used for biological control of Parthenium weed) in different parts of India. Weather parameters for July, August, September and October from 2001–2010 were considered for modeling and forecasting. Results revealed temperature between 23.3 and 24.1°C would be suitable for beetle establishment. A place which satisfy weather indices of temperature 24.17°C (24.17–26.20°C), rainfall <= 191.23 (102.33–191.23) and RH <= 77.27 (54–77.27) would be highly suitable. It is also inferred that places with high rainfall are not good for beetle establishment. Coconut: Coconut seedlings grown in open top chamber (OTC) had high biomass and seedling growth in response to elevated CO2 (700 ppm), while it significantly declined under increased temperature (3oC above ambient). Similar decline in growth was also observed under water deficit stress. As a mitigation potential, coconut could sequester 31 t CO2/ha/year, which is higher as compared to other plantation crops. Pollen germination technique was refined to screen the genotypes for high temperature tolerance. Grafting in tomato for alleviating excess soil moisture (waterlogging) stress: Grafting of improved 3. Climate Change and Resilient Agriculture DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 19 CLIMATE CHANGE AND RESILIENT AGRICULTURE DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 20 tomato cultivars Arka Rakshak, ArkaSamrat and Kashi Aman as scion on four brinjal rootstocks viz. IC-354557, IC-111056, IC-374873 and CHBR-2 revealed no leaf chlorosis and wilting, and less reduction in chlorophyll content (CCI), chlorophyll fluorescence yield (Fv/Fm) in scion stock. The non-grafted plants registered 39.6– 41% reduction in Fv/Fm and 41–100% reduction in CCI at four days after relieving from waterlogging stress. Non-grafted plants completely wilted and died in four to five days after relieving from stress, whereas, the grafted plants recovered completely from 96 hours of waterlogging stress, at three days after relieving from the stress. Potato: The impact of climate change on potato productivity in West Bengal was assessed using WOFOST crop growth model. The model has projected the highest decline of 6.1% in productivity of Kufri Pukhraj, followed by 5.9% in Kufri Jyoti and 5.1% in Kufri Badshah in year 2020 with corresponding figure of 12, 10.5 and 8.8%, respectively in 2055 without adaptation. The negative impact can be counter balanced to some extent by change in date of planting and selection of suitable cultivar.
