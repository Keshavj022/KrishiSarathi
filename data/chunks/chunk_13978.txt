 Public funding for agriculture research & extension is contributed by both centre and state with around 55 per cent of the total allocation contributed by the centre Agriculture Extension System in India: A Meta-analysis 475 and 45 per cent by states. The total R&E expenditure for agriculture and allied activities has increased from ₹31,073 million in 2000-01 to ₹61,552 million 2014-15, recording a compound annual growth rate of 5 per cent for the period 2000-01 and 2014-15 (Gulati et al. 2018). For extension, around 82 per cent of total budget allocation is funded by the state government, and around 18 per cent is allocated by the centre. In 2014-15, India allocated around for ₹ 17956 million for agriculture extension and training exclusively, which has grown from ₹ 6,407 million in 2000-01, therefore, recording a CAGR of 7.6 per cent for the given period. An important component of agriculture R&E is provisioning of funds for extension services to ensure diffusion of new innovations in the field. Historically, India spent a very small proportion of agriculture gross domestic product (GDPA) on research and development, it was at 0.32 per cent for 1971, and two decades later it rose marginally to 0.45 per cent (1991). Between 1999-00 and 2014-15, agriculture R&E expenditure as a share of GDPA increased from 0.50 per cent to 0.54 per cent. It is observed that agriculture R&E expenditure as a percentage of GDPA remained steady since 2000-01 at 0.5 per cent till 2007-08, post which it rose significantly reaching 0.7 per cent of GDPA in 2010-11 and finally settling down at 0.54 per cent in 2014-15. At the national level India spent about 0.54 per cent of its GDPA on agriculture R&E, there are considerable variations across states. Most of the eastern states spend less than 0.5 per cent of its GDPA on agriculture R&E. Eastern states, which are also among few of the poorest states in the country with a high dependency on agriculture, are also the states with the lowest spending on agriculture R&E. In order to improve agriculture productivity in this region, increasing of agriculture R&E and extension funding will be critical. It is observed that around 70 per cent of the total agriculture R&E budget is allocated to crop-husbandry itself, while only 10 per cent is allocated to animal husbandry and dairy development. Similarly, decomposition of extension expenditure across sectors shows that only crop husbandry receive around 92 per cent of total extension expenditure allocation and only 0.9 per cent was allocated to animal husbandry and dairy segment. However, animal husbandry and dairy segment have grown in importance and it is in contrast to the gradual transformation of the agriculture sector in India. To provide food and nutrition security in the country, the R&E has given high on crop husbandry.
