 A nationwide study conducted by the NABARD Consultancy Service (NABCONS) revealed significant overall post-harvest losses of 7.26 % was found in onion. The value of dehydrated onions becomes particularly evident in instances of excess onion production. Dehydration effectively lowers the moisture content to safe levels without compromising the colour, flavour, or nutritional value of the onions. This process is carried out under strictly controlled conditions. Dehydrating onions leads to a significant reduction in both weight and volume, translating into substantially lower transportation and storage costs and extended shelf life. Consequently, dehydration emerges as a viable solution for preserving excess onion produce and mitigating market price fluctuations during both glut and dearth periods. The low calorie, high nutrient dehydrated onion is a good source of potassium, vitamin B, as well as vitamin C (Table 1). Dehydrated onion packed in pouches/ containers prolongs the flavour retention and retains very little moisture helps to avoid the growth of moulds. Technology Table 1. Chemical composition of dehydrated onion slices (nutritive value/ 100 g) Nutrient Value Moisture (%) 4.60-5.50 Protein (g) 10.00-12.5 Fat (g) 0.80-1.00 Mineral (g) 3.50-4.50 Carbohydrate (g) 70-75.34 Calcium (g) 300-350 Phosphorus (g) 280-320 Iron (mg) 2.00-3.00 Vitamin C (mg) 120-150 Suitability of onion variety for dehydration Onion bulbs suitable for dehydration possess specific characteristics that ensure optimal quality and yield (Table 2). A high Total Soluble Solids (TSS) content of 15-20% or more is essential for achieving the desired flavour and dry matter (15-18%) texture. Additionally, a high insoluble solid content, not less than 1%, contributes to the structural integrity of the dehydrated onion. White flesh onions are preferred due to their resistance to discolouration and bitterness during dehydration. A low ratio of reducing to non-reducing sugars minimizes the risk of browning and caramelization. Medium-sized onions with thick necks are ideal for dehydration, as they retain their shape better during the drying process. Onions with high pungency levels, indicated by pyruvic acid content, are preferred for flavour retention. Disease and pest resistance is crucial for maintaining the quality and yield of dehydrated onions. Finally, a small root zone simplifies harvesting and handling during dehydration. Marchâ€“April 2024 37 Mechanism of dehydration Onions are typically sliced thinly and then dried in the sun or in a cabinet dehydrator. However, dehydration is a more effective method of preserving onions because it removes more moisture and therefore extends the shelf life of the onions (Table 3). During dehydration, the onion slices are placed between heated plates in a food chamber, facilitating heat transfer from the heat source to the food. This initiates a moisture diffusion process, where moisture escapes from the food.
