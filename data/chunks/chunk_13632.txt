Chemical Engineering Journal Advances 16 (2023) 100547 17 quality is very poor and chemical parameter exceeds desirable limits. Based on the overall diseases’ susceptibility mapping, it was profound that the city mainly falls under moderately susceptible zone throughout the year. Hence, continual monitoring of the water pollutant loading is essential.
