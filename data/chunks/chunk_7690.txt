 occidentale cv. Ullal-3). Genome sequence analysis of dihaploid potato C-13: Whole genome of an androgenic potato dihaploid C-13, developed through anther culture of cv. Kufri Chipsona-2, was sequenced with reference assembly. Overall, 30241 genes were identified in C-13 genome, of which 15,538 genes were characterized by the GO terms. A total of 11,22,388 SNPs and 48,145 InDels were identified in C-13 genome. Genomics approaches to improve nitrogen use efficiency in potato: Precision phenotyping of two contrasting potato varieties (Kufri Gaurav: N efficient, and Kufri Jyoti: N inefficient) was standardized in aeroponics supplied with different N doses. Plant biomass, root traits, total chlorophyll content and plant N increased with increasing N supply, whereas higher NUE parameters namely NUE, agronomic NUE (AgNUE), N uptake efficiency (NUpE), harvest index (HI), and N harvest index (NHI) were observed at low N. Identification of Indian potato varieties: SSR markers (STIKA and STU6SNRN) with potential roles in varietal identification, genetic fidelity testing, DUS and molecular characterizations were developed. Genomic SSR markers in Ocimum sanctum: Genomic SSR markers for tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) were developed using genomic sequence database. Primer pairs were designed based on SSR motifs identified and screened for amplification. These markers showed 100% polymorphism in 23 genotypes. ‚ùë 6. Livestock Improvement Cattle Genetic aspects of Holstein-Sahiwal crossbreds: The total population of Frieswal females as on 31st March 2019 at 13 Military Farms of the country was 8,199 including 451 elite Frieswal cows. During the period, 204 Frieswal bulls were maintained at bull rearing unit. The overall mean age at first calving was 970.65 days (31.92 months). The overall means of 300 days milk yield, total milk yield, peak yield (PY) and lactation length were 3,335.82, 3,346.17, 15.21 kg and 325.90 days, respectively. The least square means of service period (SP), dry period (DP) and calving interval (CI) were 159.95, 115.36 and 441.96 days, respectively. Improvement through selection: The Indigenous Cattle Breed Improvement programme covers Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal breeds. Nine each of Gir and Kankrej, and eight Sahiwal bulls of fourth set were inducted for progeny testing. During the period, 2,145, 2,466 and 836 inseminations were carried out with the conception percentages of 47.69, 45.01 and 40.78 in Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal animals, respectively. During the year, 449 Gir, 423 Kankrej and 141 Sahiwal daughters were born. The average age at first calving in Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal were 1,420.0, 1,238.42 and 1,326.94 days, respectively. The average first lactation 305 days or less milk yield, first lactation length and first peak yield in germplasm (GP) units were 2,344.4 kg, 504.2 days and 13.5 kg in Gir and 2,258.17 kg, 287.20 days and 10.49 kg in Kankrej cattle.
