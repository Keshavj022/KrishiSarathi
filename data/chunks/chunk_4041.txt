 In 1990 we had 117% more yield over China in Melons but today we are at 64% of that. On an average our yields are 41% of China today. Cauliflower is the only crop where we are close to them and the reason is the huge improvement in cauliflower in India and of course also for the fact that China consumes low per capita cauliflower. Cucumbers, Beans Dry and Green are the worst off at around less than 25%. Fresh green Chillies too at 35% are much below. Beans are an excellent source of protein for vegetarian diets and private sector hasnâ€™t been involved in breeding of self-pollinating crops where OP varieties are the main seeds sold. The reason is the fear of IP getting lost after putting in years of work and expenses. As the PVPFRA regime is strengthening it is surely an area that will now find more attention by private sector but also needs higher attention by public sector. Nutritional quality breeding: The recent pandemic has increased the demand for vegetables as all consumers now are looking for them as very healthy. There is a lot of variability for nutritional quality traits in all vegetable germplasm. Private industry is moving towards breeding for nutritional quality. Recently Advanta has released a Purple Okra hybrid in the market that is high in flavonoids and antioxidants. Syngenta delivered seedless watermelon with high lycopene and also released purple and orange cauliflower hybrids having higher nutritional quality. At Tierra the author has bred high nutritional quality tomatoes in Indeterminate segment having 100 g fruits and 35-40 g fruits (Fig 13). The hybrids have significantly higher ascorbic acid, reducing sugar and lycopene content besides carrying TY and TMV genes that make them virus resistant. TS 4809 is a green shoulder one and TS 4813 has uniform green unripe colour and both are round fruited. TS 4810 and TS 4811 are in a new segment of snack tomato. Square oval, 35-40 g weight, very firm with over two weeks shelf life even on its red fruits. All four have high flavour/taste scores on organoleptic tests. All are indeterminate and will add new products in the market from this year. This work took over six years after a high flavour heirloom germplasm was crossed with high TY resistant line, followed by pedigree selection and heterosis breeding experiments. Rootstock breeding: Bottle gourd is an excellent rootstock for wilt and cold tolerance and used in watermelon and melons successfully in countries abroad where grafted seedlings are sold. Tomatoes on bacterial and other wilt resistant stocks have started to be sold as grafted plants in many countries. In India, VNR and a Fig. 11.
