 The system is helpful in generating more employment especially during the off-season when the crops are not cultivated. The sweet lime crop canopy is comparatively shorter. It offers good scope for intercropping of short duration and short statured crops like green gram, black gram, cowpea and horse gram. Wherever there is good irrigation facility, crops like groundnut, soybean and vegetables can also be grown in the inter-row space of sweet lime trees. Economics One hectare orchard accommodates about 310 plants with a spacing of (8 × 4 m). yy Cost of cultivation per hectare: (Planting material + planting expenses+ fertilizers and manures+ other maintenance expenses) = `1,00,000=00 (Approx.) The planting material and planting expenses will be in the first year. However, the maintenance expenses will be increasing as the trees grow and it will be approximately ` 1, 00,000=00 from 5th year onwards. …………… (A) yy Expected yield/ hectare/ year (Approx. from 5th year): (No. of trees/ha x fruit weight/tree) = 310 × 100 kg = 31 tons ……………..(B) yy Market price of sweet lime = `20,000/ ton (Approx.)……. (C) yy Gross returns/ha/year = B × C = ` 6, 20,000=00……….. (D) yy Net returns/ha/year = (D) – (A) = `5,20,000=00 Thus, growing sweet lime is sustainable and profitable under suitable soil and climatic conditions. Short duration intercrops can also be raised in the inter-row spaces which increases the productivity and profitability.

It is in a great demand in both domestic and global markets and has emerged as one of the most remunerative and lucrative enterprises. It is commercially grown in the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Punjab, Haryana, Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir etc. The litchi industry has expanded rapidly during the last 10 years; wherein, area has increased substantially from 74,400 ha in year 2009-10 to 95,000 ha in the year 2018-19 (IIIrd Advance Estimate, NHB) to the tune of about 27.6%, fruit production over 47.1% and fruit productivity by 17.8% in the country. The litchi fruit industry is growing rapidly in sub-mountainous regions of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir due to favourable soil and unique agro-climatic conditions.
