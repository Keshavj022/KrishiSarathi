 Potassium, often known as potash, improves plant water use and drought resistance, as well as enhances fruits and vegetables. Potassium and phosphorus are two of the most important macronutrients for plant growth and metabolism. When plants don’t get enough of them, their roots don’t grow as well, they grow slowly, they aren’t as resistant to disease, they mature later, they make fewer seeds, and their yields are lower (Rawat and SanwalSaxena, 2016). 3.1.1.5. Electric Conductivity (EC) and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). The ion concentration of the soil solution is assumed to be measured by Fig. 1. Geographical location of the study area.

CEC is the total amount of exchangeable cations that a soil, soil component, or other material can hold at a certain pH (van Erp et al., 2001). Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is a helpful indication of soil fertility because it indicates the ca­ pacity of the soil to deliver three essential plant nutrients: calcium, magnesium, and potassium (Ross and Ketterings, 1995). Similar to the study area, a high concentration of salts (Higher value of EC) in the soil impacts the Kharif crop (Sown in Rainy Season) production negatively and essential variable for Rabi crops (Sown in Winter) cultivation (Francois et al., 1986). 3.1.1.6. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil pH. Soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation is influenced in agricultural areas where the bare soil occurs frequently for several months, especially during hot summers and inconsistent rainfall seasons (Schillaci et al., 2019) and this varia­ tion in SOC controls the Copper content in the soil. Otherwise, they’ll fail just as badly as if they were missing key components. Soil pH is thereby referred to as the “master soil variable” since it controls a myriad of soil biological, chemical, and physical qualities as well as processes that affect plant growth and biomass yield (Neina, 2019). The pH of the soil is a proxy for the activity or concentration of hydrogen ions ([H+]) in the soil solution.
