 It would be appropriate that the entire amount of phosphorus be given from single super phosphate so that 12 percent sulfur can also be supplied. A small quantity of urea fertilizer (15-20 kg/ha) should be given only in those fields which are weak in the nitrogencontent.   To control broad leaf and narrow weeds use imazethapyr @ 100 g/ha. For control of narrow weeedquizalofop @50 g/ha can be used in Arhar. 5. Green gram and Black gram Green gram varieties: Narendra Mung-1, Narendra Mung-2, T- 44, K -851, Sweta and Swati Black gram Varieties: Vallabh Urd -1, Narendra Urd-1, Narendra Urd-2, T-27, T-77, T- 65, T-9, Shekhar-1, Azad Urd-1, Shekhar-2, Azad Urd-2, Shekhar-3, Azad Urd-3 and KU-99-21 Land Preparation   One deep ploughing followed by 2-3 harrowings and plankings are considered the optimum for mungbean cultivation.   Field should be well levelled and completely free from weeds.   More uptake of nitrogen and increased protein content was possible in wider spacing. Time Of Sowing   Mungbean and Urdbean is generally sown with the onset of monsoon from June to July. Both early and late plantings have adverse affects on the performance of mungbean.   In early sowings crop suffers due to rains at maturity and late sown crop suffered due to poor growth and diseases infestation. Nutrient management:   Application of 20 kg N and 80 Kg P2O5 is advisable Water management:   Rainy season mung and urd bean does not require irrigation unless there is a prolonged drought. Weed management: Application of pedimethalin 750 g/ha/ Oxadiazon 500 g/ha as pre emergence for controlling many annual and broad leaf weeds. Imazethapyr 100 g/ha/ imazethapyr 14 g/ha + imazemox 14 g/ha/ imazethapyr 50g/ha + pendimethalin 750g/ha, sodium acifluorfen 165 g/ha + clodinafop-propargyl ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 57 80 g/ha, chlorimuron 6 g/ha, fenoxaprop 80 g/ha and quizalofop 40g/ha, as post –emergence are most effective to control grassy as well as broad-leaved weeds in soybean. This technology increases the grain production, improves quality of grain, and results higher income. 6. Groundnut   Grow improved varieties Chitra, Kaushal, Prakash, Ambar, TG-37a, Utkarsh and Divya according to the availability of growing period andpurpose   It is ready in about 120-130 days. It should be sown in the first fortnight of July so that the crop can be ready by the end ofOctober.   According to the species and season, the number of seeds and distance of 2 lines should be 45- 50 cm and the distance between 2 plants should be 15-20 cm. Use 70-75 kg seed kernels/ha for all varieties. In late sown conditions, Use 90-95 kg seedkernels/ha.   Before sowing the seed (kernel) should be treated with Thiram 2g and 1g of Carbendazim per kg of seed or Trichoderma @ 4g + 1g of Carboxine per kg of seed. Before sowing, treat the seeds with peanut-specific Rhizobium culture before sowing 5-6 hours. One packet is enough for 10 kg ofseeds.
