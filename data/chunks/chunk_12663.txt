2 Strategies and Role of technology for Doubling of Farmers’ Income Strategies to enhance income   Producing marketable surplus (increase in farm and livestock productivity)   Stabilizing prices of local commodities   Enabling policies and their implementation   Reducing cost of production   Reducing risk factor (PMFBY, IPM, INM, IFS, livestock)   Diversification in farming and cropping systems through high-value crops and components   Secondary agriculture and value addition   Production taking cognizance of natural resources   Improved terms of trade for farmers   Augmenting income from other sources including agro-tourism   Capacity building and use of ICT A. State level Action plan   Increasing cropping intensity through efficient water management   Enhancing micro-irrigation (existing 10% area). Narmada model should be replicated in IGNP   Promoting low-water requirement crops instead of groundnut, castor, rice)   Increasing irrigated area and cropping intensity with saved water   Amalgamation of water harvesting and crop production, solar pumping, agri-voltaic system/solar farming (Rs. 22 lakh/ha annual income)   In-situ and ex-situ water harvesting   Groundnut should not be planted before 15 June Livestock-based IFS approach   Single commodity output in rainfed farming gives low income   Round-the-year employment   Appropriate combination of horticulture, grasses, livestock, boundary plantation, crops   Adding income avenues in fodder, food, fruit   Developing entrepreneurship (FPOs, SHGs, PPPP) for marketing milk of goat, indigenous cow, camel 466 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 Improving livestock productivity   Average daily milk yield of cow, buffalo, goat is better than the country average   Augmenting fodder supply (30-40% shortage) through rejuvenation of grasslands   Region-specific multi-nutrient mixture, feed blocks or pellets to address mineral deficiency   Breed improvement of livestock   Establishing environmental friendly abattoir, meat and byproduct processing facilities Increasing productivity   Enhance SRR of disease and pest-resistant varieties and hybrids. Promoting early maturing cultivars especially in drought prone areas (maturity from 90 days to 60 days)   Quality planting material of fruits   Breed improvement of livestock Diversification with high-value crops   Horticulture   Protected cultivation   Vegetables   New crops (e.g.
