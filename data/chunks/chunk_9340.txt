Conservation Strategies for Agrobiodiversity: Floral Biodiversity “Care for the community of life with understanding, compassion and love. Accept that with right to own, manage and use natural resources comes the duty to prevent environmental harm and to protect the right of people.” (Mahatma Gandhi, Young India, October, 1921) The proper conservation and use of agro-biodiversity are fundamental to sustainable development and food security. As plant genetic resources (a major component of agrobiodiversity) providing food, fodder, fuel, fibre are fundamental to the fulfillment of the basic needs of a human beings, their loss will cause serious damage to economic and social development. Hence, genetic resources, including plants, animals, fish, have to be conserved and managed for sustainable use. For the improvement of crops, and animals, germplasm resources are the prerequisite is a fact well recognised worldwide, and continuous efforts are being employed to collect, protect, and manage them. Various approaches being followed for their conservation are described below. Ex-situ conservation: Ex-situ conservation refers to the conservation of genetic material separate from their natural habitat in facilities under artificial conditions supporting storage and perpetuation. Ex-situ conservation virtually safeguards and provides the required supply of germplasm for research and breeding (Singh et al. 2004) and for possible repatriation as and when required. Some of the possible approaches for the Ex-situ conservation are grouped as: Plant conservation: (a) Botanical garden, (b) Herbal garden, (c) Arboreta, (d) Cropping field gene-bank and (e) clonal repositories. Seed conservation: (a) Low-temperature storage of orthodox seeds (seed genebank), (b) Cryopreservation: storage of orthodox, intermediate and recalcitrant (embryonic axis) seeds 67 in liquid nitrogen which has temperature -150 to -196 oC. The details of the present status of conservation of plant genetic resources at the National Genebank located in New Delhi is provided in Table 4. Table 4.
