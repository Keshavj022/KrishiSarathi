 • PTCMT shall be produced and multiplied from certified in vitro plants or micro tubers, as per the requirements. Greenhouse/controlled environment requirement 1. All micro propagation and greenhouse facilities must meet the standards given above under eligibility requirements. 2. The soil used for PTCMT production should not be infested with pathogen and pests of potato, particularly, Wart (Synchytrium endobioticum) (Schilb.) Perc. and or cyst forming nematodes (Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida); brown rot (Ralstonia Table 3.

Seed lot having infected tuber more than prescribed limit will not be certified even after treatment. **A tuber carrying 10% or above scurfed surface will be considered as one infected unit. However, seed lot having black scurf infection more than prescribed limits could be certified after treatment with approved chemical/fungicide. ***For all diseases, the higher disease percentage will be considered for the purpose of the specified limits of tolerance.

Inspection of controlled environment facility used for production of PTCMT 1. The grower must notify the competent authority of his production plans well in advance of the planting. 2. The crop must be grown from certified basic in vitro plants or microtubers which were produced, in an aseptic environment. 3. A minimum of 3 inspections shall be made as given below. i. The first inspection shall be made 35 and 45 days after planting for plains and hills respectively to verify growing conditions, extent of disease infection and off types and also to confirm isolation requirement. ii. The second inspection shall be made at 60-65 days after planting to verify off types, disease infection (if any) and pathogen testing on a representative sample comprising of 1% of the plants with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 25 plants sampled for each variety. iii.
