 • Integrated weed management in groundnut based intercropping system revealed that pre‐ emergent application of pendimethalin (1 kg ailha) or oxyfluorfen (0.12 kg ai/ha) along with 1 hand weeding at 25‐30 DAS at Kadiri effectively controlled the weeds in groundnut + pigeon pea intercropping system. While in groundnut + black gram intercropping, pre emergent application of pendimethalin @ 1.0 kg ai/ha as along with 1 hand weeding at 25‐30 DAS effectively controlled the weeds at Vriddhachalam. • In groundnut‐wheat crop sequence, pre emergence application of fluchloralin 1 kg ai/ha in groundnut and 2‐4 D sodium salt 500 ml/ha as post emergence in wheat at Durgapura and fluchloralin 1 kg ai/ha in groundnut and pre emergence application offluchloralin 1 kg ai/ha in blackgram at Vriddhachalam was found optimum. • Adoption of in‐situ moisture conservation increased pod yield by 11.1‐17.7 % over control at Aliyarnagar, Chintamani, Durgapura & Jhargram. The results indicated that there is a possibility of reducing plant population and fertilizer dose (up to 25%) when in‐situ moisture conservation technique is adopted. • In groundnut + pigeon pea intercropping, irrigating pigeonpea at 0.5 IW/CPE at Aliyarnagar, Durgapura and 0.75 IW/CPE at Junagadh gave maximum net returns and BCR of the system. In groundnut + castor intercropping, irrigation to castor at 0.75 IW/CPE at Junagadh gave maximum net returns and BCR of the system III. Crop Protection • Germplasm evaluation against major diseases revealed that four genotypes viz; ICGV‐91167, Y‐ I024, CSMG‐84‐1 and JL ‐80 appeared to be promising against stem rot «10% as against 48% in TG‐ 26) at Jalgaon. Three genotypes, M‐95‐71, No. 1040 and PI‐158853 were found to be promising against PBND «5% as against 38% in other genotype) at Raichur. www.icar.org.in 41 2002 ‐ 2007 • Three entries, R 2001‐1, VG 9816 and PBS 29017 at Aliyarnagar and six entries, JALW 26, TG 51, TG 52 and TKG 19A at Vriddhachalam showed resistant reaction against LLS and rust. • Four genotypes, Dh‐lOl, BSG 9802, GG 2 and Dh‐106 at Dharwad and four entries, ICGS 44, R 2001‐1, AK 159 and TG 50 at Jalgaon showed promise against stem rot. • Five genotype, ICUG 92195, CSMG 9884, DSGl, TG17 and RG 141 showed promise against dry root rot at Kadiri. • R 2001‐1 showed multiple disease resistance (LLS, rust, stem rot) • At Raichur, RS‐l a released variety showed lowest foliage damage (15.5%) as against 67(Yo in TPT‐ l and four germplasm lines viz., Go‐103. MK‐374, VRIGJARlJL fmd NCAC‐60 caused lowest damage « 10~/'O) as against 76% in lCG‐7237 and 49 % in KRG‐l. • At Raichur, one gernlplasm line, NRCG‐2323 recorded minimum damage (23~/o) due to GLM as against 80‐85% in other genotypes. • The genotypes, .lB‐1101 (21% damage) and A1S‐2003‐5. (25<)/0 damage) showed less foliage damage of thrips (c. indicus) as against 85% damage in ICGV‐86590 at Junagadh. • At Junagadh genotypes viz.
