 Moreover, advanced unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering algorithms, can also be employed to identify anomalies in large datasets without the need for labeled training examples. These algorithms can detect outliers that deviate significantly from expected patterns, which may indicate defects or spoilage. Smart sensors for real time monitoring and cold chain logistics and processing: Monitoring cold chain logistics is a critical component in the postharvest management of horticultural crops, ensuring that products maintain their quality and safety from the point of harvest to the final consumer. Smart sensors are integral to modern postharvest management, providing accurate and timely data that allow for informed decision-making. A smart sensor is a device that takes input from the physical environment and uses built-in compute resources to perform predefined functions upon detection of specific input and then process data before passing it on. In smart storage facilities, a network of IoT devices is employed to continuously monitor critical environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and gas composition. Sensors are strategically placed throughout storage areas to gather real-time data, allowing for precise control over the storage environment. Temperature and humidity sensors are deployed within storage facilities and transport containers to continuously monitor environmental conditions. Typically, these sensors use thermocouples or thermistors to measure temperature and hygrometers to gauge humidity levels. These sensors transmit data via wireless protocols (e.g. Zigbee, Wi-Fi) to a centralized monitoring system. The system can analyze the data in real time and trigger alerts if conditions deviate from pre-defined thresholds. For instance, maintaining a temperature of 0-4°C for fruits like strawberry can significantly prolong its shelf-life. If the temperature rises above 4°C, automated notifications can prompt corrective actions, such as adjusting cooling systems or redistributing products to maintain optimal conditions. Additionally, the integration of GPS tracking with cold chain monitoring systems enhances visibility and control throughout the transportation process. By combining location data with temperature and humidity readings, logistics managers can track not only where the shipment is but also the conditions it is experiencing at any given moment. Gas composition sensors utilize electrochemical or infrared detection technologies to monitor gases such as oxygen (O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen (N) in controlled atmosphere storage. These sensors are installed in storage chambers where the atmospheric composition is adjusted to slow down respiration and ripening processes. Real-time adjustments to gas mixtures can be made based on sensor feedback, optimizing conditions for different types of produce.
