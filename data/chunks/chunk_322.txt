The implementation of innovative techniques, like the System of Millet Intensification (SMI) for finger millet, has resulted in doubled yields compared to traditional methods. • Pests and diseases: Millets, known for their resilience, are susceptible to a range of pests and diseases, including shoot flies, stem borers and various caterpillars. Diseases like downy mildew and smut also pose a significant threat to crop yield. In addition, stored millet grains are vulnerable to damage from insects, fungi, and rodents, especially during the rainy season. Effective pest and disease management strategies are crucial for improving millet production. • Lack of markets: Despite their exceptional nutritional value, millets face limited demand in urban areas, which, in turn, hampers the ability of farmers to find buyers and secure fair prices. This lack of urban interest can discourage farmers from continuing millet cultivation. Initiatives aimed at creating awareness about the nutritional benefits of millets and marketing strategies emphasizing their culinary versatility could help boost demand in urban markets. • Lack of technical knowledge: Successful millet cultivation requires a certain level of expertise and knowledge, which many Chhattisgarh farmers lack. Inadequate training in millet farming techniques leads to reduced yields and profits. It is essential to implement training programs and workshops to equip farmers with the skills and knowledge necessary for successful millet cultivation. • Lack of infrastructure: The lack of necessary infrastructure for millet cultivation in Chhattisgarh includes storage facilities, processing units and transportation networks. The State’s landlocked nature and underdeveloped railways and road networks make it challenging for farmers to access markets, both domestically and overseas, leading to post- harvest losses. • Competition from other crops: The shift of Chhattisgarh farmers towards cash crops like paddy and soybean, which offer higher profits, has led to a decline in millet cultivation. Initiatives promoting the economic benefits of millet farming and potentially offering incentives to millet cultivators could help reverse this trend. • Processing efficiency: Processing millets is essential to make them edible and enhance their quality. Some millets require multiple processing steps to optimize grain recovery and polish them without compromising their nutritional value.
