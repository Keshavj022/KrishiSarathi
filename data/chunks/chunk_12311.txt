 Strategy and Interventions for Scarce Rainfall Zone State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 15 Strategy 1: Productivity Enhancement   Drought tolerant groundnut (Dharani) sown with seed cum fertilizer drill.   Improved varieties of Redgram (PRG 158), Mungari Cotton (Srinandi, Yaganti).   Millets, blackgram, greengram, sesamum as preceding crops preceding chickpea in kharif fallows   Micro irrigation system in mango, pomegranate, drumstick, papaya   Foliar application of micronutrients   Production and supply of quality groundnut seed through Mana vitana Kendras (Our Seed Centers) involving farmers clubs for village level seed production and certification   Double cropping in Kharif fallow- chickpea cropping areas.   Preceding catch crop of pulse/ millet followed by chickpea/tobacco in southern light soils of Prakasam district Strategy 2: Cost reduction   Intercropping systems with Redgram + Foxtail millet, Red- gram + Pearl Millet, Redgram + groundnut in black soils   Promotion of zero tillage chickpea under double cropping sequence & promotion of mechanical harvest genotypes (NBeG 47)   Seed to seed mechanization in chickpea   Farm mechanization through custom hiring centres Strategy 3: Quality Improvement / Processing/ value addition/ niche markets   Processing varieties of mango, tomato   Organic farming/ natural farming   Processing & value addition to millets, supply chains, linking to markets   Shade net house for nursery and vegetable production   Promotion of Farmers clubs/ FPOs/ FPCs for value chains and market linkages Strategy 4: Generation of additional income   Mini diary-goatery-BYP-high value floriculture, ram lamb rearing   Semi-intensive & intensive sheep production with feed making units   Apiculture for small farmers and landless   Free range poultry farming (hatchery / mother units / feed making units) Technological interventions matrix for districts of Andhra Pradesh Area Major Intervention Objective contribution North Coastal Zone: District Srikakulam (paddy, maize, cashew nut, coconut, chillies) Productivity enhancement and Cost reduction Direct seeding of paddy with Drum seeder Direct seeding of paddy with drum seeder in puddled soil is the technology that is very much effective because it saves time, labour and cost of cultivation due to skipping of nursery raising, nursery pulling and transplanting. In this method the yield increase is by 4.1% and cost of cultivation is reduced by an amount of Rs 4000-5500 per/ acre. State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 16 Area Major Intervention Objective contribution Climate resilient Promotion of flood tolerant paddy varieties in flood prone areas of Andhra Pradesh About 1.39 m ha area is flood prone in Andhra Pradesh. Among various varieties tested MTU-1061 gave a yield advantage of 28.6 to 59.1% over check (MTU-7029) and 40 to 65% in increase net income.
