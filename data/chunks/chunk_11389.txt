 Also advised to apply Trichoderma viridae @ 5kg/ ha mixed with 100 kg FYM to manage the soil borne diseases. Foliar spray with Beauveria bassiana or verticillium @ 2-4 kg/ ha with 400-500 lit. water to manage the sucking insect problem in vegetables. Advised to foliar spray of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt.) @ 1 liter per hectare for the management of lepidopteran insect-pests. Also advised to use HaNPV @ 250-500 LE/ ha to manage the tomato fruit borer, Helocoverpa armigera. Advised to more focus on non-chemical method of insect-pest management in vegetables to avoid hazardous effects of chemical pesticides, botanicals are also an important component of IPM as suggested below- Foliar spray with NSKE 5% or Neem oil 2% or Azadirachtin 3000ppm @ 3ml/lit. water is effective against different insect-pests. Chemical control: It is advised to use Ridomil M.Z. @ 2.5/lit. or Copper Oxy chloride @ 3kg/ 1000 lit. water to manage the foliar diseases in different vegetables. To manage the viral diseases like leaf curl virus, yellow vein clearing virus, mosaic virus farmers should ensure the removal of Dhatura and Makoy weed plant from the field, adopt virus resistant varieties like ‘Arka Rakshak’ and practiced foliar spray with systemic insecticide like Malathion 50 EC @ 1ml/lit. water or Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 0.3ml/lit. water to manage the vector of such viruses. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 106 More focus should be given on new molecules like Spinosad 45 SL @ 200-250 ml/ha or Emamectin benzoate 5 SG 500 ml/ha or Indoxacarb 14.5 EC @ 200 ml/ha to manage the shoot and fruit borer and defoliator insects in tomato, brinjal, chili, okra etc. Mites also cause significant damage in vegetables, foliar spray with Sulphur 80 WDG @ 2g/lit. and Dicofol @ 2ml or Abametin @ 0.5ml or Spiromesifen @1 ml or Chlorofenpyr @1ml per litre water effective against mites. Nematode management in vegetables: Nematode is a serious problem in vegetables like tomato, brinjal, okra, chilli, potato etc. Farmers are advised to adopt integrated management as suggested below- Crop rotation, deep summer ploughing (May-June) of field followed soil solarization by covering the soil with black polyethene sheet for 4-5 weeks, soil application with Paecillomyces lilacinus @ 5kg/ha mixed with 100 kg FYM or 2.5 tone neem or castor cake to before sowing or transplanting. Soil also can be treated with the application of carbofuran 3G @ 25 kg/ha. Use of nematode resistant varieties: Tomato: Hisar Lalit, Nematex, Pusa-120, Ronita, Kalyanpur-1, 2,3, Slecon-120, Hilani, Arka Vardan, Arka Rakshak Brinjal: Black beauty, Vijaya, Banaras, Jaint Chili: Pusa Jwala, N.P.-46-A, Mohini, K-2, C.A. 1366, C.A. 2123 Okra: I.C. 9773, I.C. 18960 Flower cultivation Training and pruning of rose should be done and spray of Diethane M-45@ 2 g/litre of water at cut portion. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 107 Sowing of gladiolus bulb after treatment of bulb with 2g per litre Bavistin solution for 10-15 minute.
