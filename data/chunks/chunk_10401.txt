 Animal Health Institutes of ICAR have developed more than 25 vaccines and about 80 diagnostics including nucleic acid-based tests, which have played a significant role in the control of economically important diseases and eradication of some of them from the country. In the current era of intellectual property rights, the adoption of new technologies from other sources requires various protocols. Hence, it is very important to develop indigenous technologies as has been emphasized by the Government of India through slogans ‘Vocal for Local’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. Besides prevention and control of endemic diseases, the emergence of new diseases requires a robust disease forecasting mechanism, preparedness, and rapid emergency response to prevent the incursion of new transboundary diseases/ exotic diseases. Therefore, advanced preparedness to handle any such eventuality through prior risk assessment and rapid emergency response becomes very important to combat such incursions. Recent experiences with COVID-19 pandemic emphasize the need for robust epidemiological data and availability of indigenous and cost- effective diagnostics/ vaccine platforms for dealing with such outbreaks and pandemics. There is an urgent need for greater regional collaboration and cooperation with organizations like BIMSTEC, ASEAN, SAARC, etc., for sharing of information and technical know- how including microbial resources for monitoring and control of animal diseases.
