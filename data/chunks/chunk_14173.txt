 In this region, the minimum annual rainfall for cultivation of the most drought tolerant millet is around 300 mm, while zones with 500 mm annual precipitation (sufficient for more water demanding crops) are located only 80 km–100 km east and south highlighting the geographical proximity of zones with very different agricultural potential. Variations in agricul­ tural systems and hydraulic adaptations to these semi-marginal envi­ ronments are therefore a fundamental factor in how complex societies adapt to differing environmental conditions in areas such as arid Gujarat. Archaeology offers the potential to provide a long-term record of both agricultural systems and hydraulic adaptations, their forms, stability, and adaptive shifts, providing information relevant to current and future concerns, especially where climatic events intersect with highly vulnerable semi-arid environments (Pokharia et al., 2017). Previous regional studies have documented climatic variability over * Corresponding author E-mail address: anilk_pokharia@bsip.res.in (A.K.

These studies have been correlated with cultural changes in prehistory, such as the emergence of Bronze Age urbanisation with the Indus Valley Civilisation as well as its subsequent “collapse” (Dixit et al., 2018; Giesche et al., 2023; Giosan et al., 2018; Madella and Fuller, 2006; Prasad et al., 2014). In the period, ca. 2000−1500 Before Common Era (BCE), a weakening monsoon resulting in multidecadal droughts appears to have driven increased agricultural diversity, increased reliance upon drought tolerant summer crops such as millets, and a region wide deurbanisation (or “collapse”) that was characterised by a marked reduction in popu­ lation density and regional migration (Giesche et al., 2023; Giosan et al., 2018; Madella and Fuller, 2006; Petrie and Bates, 2017; Pokharia et al., 2017). Indeed, archaeologists have drawn similar correlations between extended periods of severe drought and deurbanisation or “collapse” globally, from Mesoamerica (Douglas et al., 2015; Kennett et al., 2022; Medina-Elizalde and Rohling, 2012) to Mesopotamia (Cookson et al., 2019; Manning et al., 2023), the Greenland Norse (Zhao et al., 2022) and the ancient Andes (Arnold et al., 2021). However, considerably less focus has been directed towards human responses in South Asia to northern hemisphere warming and cooling periods during historic periods over the last two millennia – e.g.
