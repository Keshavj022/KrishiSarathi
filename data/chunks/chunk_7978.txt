 Three crops of coriander were taken from 1 June to 30 September with crop duration of 45 days which gave cumulative biomass yield of 167.23, 162.83, 139.80 q/ha of green leafy coriander under 90 % green, 75 % black and 75 % green shaded net in off-season. Guinea grass + cowpea performance under 75% reduction in dose of FYM Cucumber under drip fertigation CROP MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2017â€“18 58 Similarly, three crops of fenugreek were taken from 1 June to 30 September with crop duration of 30 days which gave cumulative biomass yield of 146.20, 128.57, 113.2 q/ha of green leafy fenugreek under 90 % green, 75 % black and 75 % green shad net in off-season. Higher seed yield of fennel (23.3 q/ha) was recorded from soil application of zinc @ 5 kg/ha, followed by soil application of iron 10 kg/ha (22.6 q/ha). Maximum fresh root (1,583 kg/ha) and dry root (762 kg/ha) yield of ashwagandha was recorded due to application of castor cake @ 2.5 tonnes/ha. Mushroom: Spent Mushroom Substrate (SMS) of button and oyster mushroom were successfully recycled for compost making for button mushroom cultivation. The conversion ratio of wheat straw to ready compost ranged from 3.67 (30% wheat straw substituted with oyster mushroom SMS without N balancing) to 2.96 in the control (standard formulation) with reduced cost for production of one tonne of compost (` 2,903 in 30% wheat straw substitution) with button mushroom SMS in comparison to ` 3,348 (control). The biological efficiency (BE) of different strains of shiitake mushroom on wheat straw based substrate revealed strain DMRO-327 to be the best with maximum BE of 60.23%. The production technology of king oyster (Pleurotus eryngii) on saw dust based substrate supplemented with organic nitrogen materials with a biological efficiency of 30% was standardized. CROP PROTECTION Yellow rust of wheat and barley (Puccinia striiformis): During 2016-17, 401 samples collected from seven different states of north India of yellow rust of wheat and barley were analyzed. Total 11 pathotypes were identified based on Indian wheat differentials. The frequency of Puccinia triticina (pt.) 46S119 (virulent to Yr2, Yr3, Yr4, Yr6, Yr7, Yr8, Yr9, Yr17, Yr18, Yr19, Yr21, Yr22, Yr23, Yr25 and YrA) was maximum (54.5%) followed by pt. 110S119 (33.0%). Barring 238S119, which was identified in 6% of the samples, remaining 6 pathotypes were observed in few samples only. It was also true for Puccinia triticina 78S84 which was predominant up to 2010-11, occurred in one yellow rust sample only. Puccinia striiformis f. sp. Tritici (Pst) population was found a virulent on Yr5, Yr10, Yr15, Yr Sp and YrSk. In barley, frequency of Puccinia triticina 57 and M was nearly same as was evident from the 13 samples of barley yellow rust analyzed during the year.
