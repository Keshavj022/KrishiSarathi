 Mallavapuram, Renigunta Mandal TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, REFINEMENT AND TRANSFER 173 could harvest tomato crop with a cost : benefit ratio of 1 : 1.87. Because of the farmers interest towards IPM technology and achievement made so far, the State Agricultural Department of Jharkhand has declared one of the adopted village of KVK Ranchi (Barodi) as ‘Bio-village’. The farmers of Maharashtra normally used to spray cotton crop 6–10 times throughout the season, but on adopting the IPM technology demonstrated by KVK Nanded now the farmers are using only 2–3 sprays of insecticides. Due to the impact of the IPM project, the incidence of pest and disease has come down, the natural predators being conserved, the yield has increased from 0.25 to 0.77 tonne/ha. The KVK centres organized 52 training programmes covering 4,272 farmers, two field days covering 185 farmers, four kisan melas covering 500 farmers, 24 extension literatures and 142 newspaper coverages, and 107 advisory services. AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION CENTRES (ATICs) The main objective of establishment of these centres under NATP is to create a single window support system linking various units of a research institution/SAU to provide technological products, diagnostic services and technology information to the farmers and other end user. A total of 0.08 million farmers were provided with diagnostic services. The centres have provided 3,735 tonnes of seeds of improved varieties, 1.107 million nursery plants, and 3.81 million packets of biofertilizers and pesticides. Others activities were testing of 16,272 soil samples, diagnosis of 21,112 specimens of diseased plants; and treatment of 47,991 animals. REMANDATED ZONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH STATIONS (ZARSs) The activities include (i) organizing vocational trainings for the farmers groups in agriculture and allied enterprises, (ii) on-farm testing of technologies related to crop, horticulture, livestock, fisheries, etc. (iii) frontline demonstrations on major cereals, oilseeds and pulses and other related enterprises and (iv) in-service training of field-level extension functionaries. Five training programmes on IPM was organized for scientists of ZARSs. The ZARSs have conducted 1,654 training programmes for farmers and farm women (1,230), rural youths (137) and in-service extension personnel (287), covering 40,000 beneficiaries. A total of 1,197 extension activities including kisan melas (78), field days (180), kisan gosthies (109) film shows (47), exhibitions (36) and ex-trainees sammelans (2), covering 86,000 participants were carried out. In addition, 553 radio and TV talks, 308 popular articles, 271 extension literatures, 329 advisory services to farmers and 1,209 newspaper coverages were also undertaken. A total of 809 tonnes of seeds of cereals, oilseeds, pulses and vegetables; and 0.55 million saplings/seedlings of fruits, vegetables and forest species were produced.
