These district-level institutions have been instrumental in shaping the trajectory of Indian agriculture, driving innovation, and empowering farmers with scientific knowledge and techniques. Their journey began with the establishment of the first KVK in Puducherry (formerly Pondicherry) on March 21, 1974 by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) following Dr Mohan Singh Mehta Committee Report recommendations. Since then, KVKs have played a pivotal role in transforming agricultural practices and fostering innovation across the country. The Planning Commission, keeping in view the demand of people from various corners to establish more KVKs in the country had approved scheme of ICAR to establish 44 new KVKs during the Sixth Plan. Further, the National Commission on Agriculture (1976) in its report on ‘Research, Education and Extension’ recommended that there should be a plan for each district to have one KVK and ultimately to have three for each district.
