 The group of small millets includes finger millet (Eleusine coracana), little millet (Panicum flexuosum), kodo millet (Paspalum scrobiculatum), foxtail millet (Setaria italica), barnyard millet (Echinochloa frumentacea), proso millet (Setaria italica) and browntop millet (Brachiaria ramosa). These crops, known by different names in local languages have traditionally been the vital component of dry farming and hill agriculture systems in India supporting millions of poor and food insecure people. Keywords: Ancient grain, Dryland, Green revolution, Marginal farming, Millets T HE area under millets cultivation has been drastically decreasing over the last six decades in India, especially since the green revolution. The area under small millets (Table 1) has also declined considerably in all the states where they were predominantly grown in the past. Introduction of high yielding varieties (HYVs) of different crops; shift from millets to more profitable crops in kharif such as soybean, maize, cotton and sunflower in different states; changing food habits and consumer preferences due to rapid urbanization and rising income levels; difficulty in processing of small millets; poor quality of the grains and lack of market support are the major reasons for losing the area under small millets cultivation. Share of small millets in the Gross Cropped Area has declined to a level of 0.88% (finger millet–0.56%, other small millets–0.32%) during the period of 2014– 19, which was 4.9% (finger millet–1.6%, other small millets–3.3%) during the period of 1956–61. Share in the total food grains production has also declined to a level of 0.71% (finger millet–0.58%, other small millets–0.13%) during the period of 2016–21 which was 5.2% (finger millet– 2.5%, other small millets–2.7%) during the period of 1956–61. The period between 1951 and 2021 saw a dramatic decline in cultivated area under small millets (89.7% for small millets other than finger millet, 52% for finger millet) (Table 2). The area under finger millet remained nearly stable at around 2.50 m ha during the Indian Farming 73 (01): 38-41; January 2023 Table 1.
