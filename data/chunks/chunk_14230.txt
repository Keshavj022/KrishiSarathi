LSA - Level Areal extent Land characteristics Remarks Highly Suitable 80.53 sq.km Gentle to moderate slopes with deep soils pH high to moderate High nutrient soils Slightly erosion Paddy land with fallow land Vegetation land cover Land that is suitable for agriculture. If irrigation facilities are provided, intensive agriculture is conceivable. Moderately Suitable 87.38 sq.km Stiff slopes (2 ° to 5 °) with micro-Terracing Loam texture pH high to moderate Agriculture and fallow land with forest Land that is suitable for arable cultivation when managed properly. Marginally Suitable 82.34 sq.km Availability of nutrients is low due to the steep slope Terrace farming and fallow land Scrubland on shallow soil and moderate slope Loam soil texture Under attentive land management, medium suitable for agriculture and planting. It is conceivable on the terrace, but land protection from extensive erosion and drainage is required. Not Suitable 53.07 sq.
