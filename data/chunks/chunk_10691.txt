 In Punjab, highly metsulfuron methyl-resistant biotypes of R. dentatus were found from Fatehgarh Sahib, Patiala and Hoshiarpur districts. The herbicide resistance in R. dentatus after P. minor in India is an alarming signal for the sustainable wheat production. Therefore, the use of metsulfuron-methyl is not economical for control of R. dentatus, where resistance has been confirmed. Management strategies To control resistant weeds, integrated weed management through use of herbicides having alternate modes of action should be recommended. Further, preventive strategies such as use of certified weed free seeds, field scouting, clean farm equipments restricted movement of weed seeds within fields and field-to-field along with removal of weed seeds should be integrated with chemical measures. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: ankurchaudhary292@gmail.com R. dentatus biotype with control (left), 2,4-D sodium salt 500 g/ha, 2,4-D ester 238 g/ha, carfentrazone ethyl 20 g/ha, metsulfuron methyl + carfentrazone ethyl 25 g/ha and halauxifen + fluroxypyr 240.6 g/ha at 20 DAT. Successful cultivation of bio fortified wheat variety WB-02 in district Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh The area under wheat is about 145,000 ha in Bijnor district, out of that about 75,000 ha area is under timely sown condition. The variety WB-02 is rich in zinc (42 ppm) and iron (40 ppm) in comparison to 32 ppm zinc and 28 ppm iron in other wheat varieties with maturity of 138–140 days, bold grained, resistant against yellow rust and leaf blight. WB- 02 was introduced and demonstrated by KVK Bijnor during rabi 2017–18 and 2018–19 at 25 farmers’ field through OFT and FLD. Average yield at farmers field recorded was 57.50 q/ha (63.75 q maximum yield per ha) with cost of cultivation of ` 46,345/ha and net profit ` 91,605/ha. The area under this variety has now spread to more than 850 ha in just two years. Farmers are satisfied with the yield of this variety and also claim that it is better for chapatti making with higher enrichment of zinc and iron. The successful farmer is Sri Satish Kumar belonging to Sidiyawali village in Noorpur block of Bijnor district.

This disease was first reported from South America, Brazil. Sudden outbreak of this disease was reported in 2016 in Bangladesh. The states of Bangladesh near the border of West Bengal are at risk for cultivating wheat. This can be the cue for this pathogen to take entry into India. Therefore, care should be taken by implementing regular monitoring and continuous vigilance to prevent the entry of the pathogen in India. Keywords: Magnaporthe sp.
