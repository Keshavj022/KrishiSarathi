 Around 6 inches of litter is needed in houses during winter. 24 hours lighting provision inside the poultry shade. Numbers of feeder should be increased. Continuous supply of fresh and clean lukewarm water inside the Poultry shade. Routine inspection of Pipeline. Provision of heater inside the Poultry shade. Fisheries The feed cost in fish cultivation is about 60-70% of total expenditure. Thus, preparation of feed from low cost easily available local ingredients can reduce the expenditure and increase the profit. During winter, most of the fishes need to sell and dry the pond by removing the water for pond management. The stocking density about to 20% during winter period improves the fish cultivation. In feed mill, ensure that the workers are following industry best practices, along with strict protocols of hygiene and physical sanitation regarding COVID-19. During winters, various fungal, bacterial, and parasitic diseases like fin rot, gill rot, EUS and argulosis may appear in the fish. Treat the pond with CIFAX @ 400 ml/acre just before the onset of winters. Also treat the pond with potassium permanganate @ 1-2 kg/acre or limestone @ 50-100 kg/acre. Salt application @ 100 kg/acre also helps in protecting fish against disease outbreak during winters. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 214 odIsHA Field Crops Cereals Rice (Rabi) The rice varieties like CR dhan 310, Hiranyamayee, improved Lalat, IR-36, Jogesh, Manaswini, MTU-101, MTU-1010, Naveen, Rajlaxmi (Hybrid) and Ajay (Hybrid) are advisable for cultivation to get better yield. Use of Certified seeds and germination test is advisable. Seed rate for rabi rice is 20 kg/acre. Chloropyriphos dust should be applied in the nursery bed to avoid ants and mites. Well decomposed FYM can be applied @ 5 ton/ha. To manage stem borer in paddy, Cartap Hydrochloride 4% G (Caldan 4G/ Nidan) @ 8 kg/acre or Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR (Ferterra/ Enfuse) @ 4 kg/acre or Imidacloprid 0.3% GR (Ultimate) @ 6 kg/acre can be applied by mixing it with sand at 1:1 ratio at early crop stage. To control blast disease in paddy, apply Tricyclazole 75% WP @ 120 g/acre. Line transplanting should be followed in the main field. Rice crop should be harvested when the crop looks pale yellow and is at 85% grain maturity. The harvested paddy should be dried in direct sunlight for 2-3 days to get moisture content at 14%. Maize (Rabi) Seed rate for rabi maize is 6-7 kg/acre. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 215 Seed treatment with (Cyantoaniliprone 19.8% + Thiamethoxam 19.8%) @ 4 ml per kg of seeds is recommended to avoid infestation of fall army worm. Atrazine 50% WP @ 800 gm per acre in 200 litres of water is recommended as pre-emergence herbicide within 2-3 DAS. Pulses Suitable varieties of green gram -IPM 02-14, and black gram- PU- 31 are advised for sowing to farmers for higher productivity. Pulse crops like Black gram can be inter-cropped with Maize to suppress weed growth within the rows and retain soil moisture.
