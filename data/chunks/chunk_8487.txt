 In a long-term soil-fertility management experiment (5 years), maximum berseem equivalent yield (144.8 tonnes of green/ha) was recorded in guinea-grass + cowpea – berseem sequence. Organic source of manuring continued to be superior over inorganic source, in terms of yield, organic-carbon and available N, P and K status of the soil. Available S depleted by 45% and 35% in no manure and inorganic sources, respectively. Urea and FYM in 1 : 1 ratio produced maximum biomass yield (35.4 tonnes of green/ha and 8.67 tonnes of dry/ha) of sorghum + cowpea. It was at a par with 100% FYM, 25% urea + 75% FYM and 25% urea + 50% FYM + biofertilizers. The volatilization losses of ammonia could be significantly reduced by combined use of 25% urea – N + 50% FYM-N + biofertilizers. The level of organic carbon, available N and K and microbial biomass carbon improved maximum with 100% FYM manuring. Silvopasture in small holdings provided highest production (7.31 tonnes of dry matter yield (DMY/ha), followed by large holdings (5.68 tonnes DMY/ha) and medium holdings (4.72 tonnes DMY/ha). Trees contributed maximum (48%) in large holdings, followed by small (37%) and medium holdings (35%). Hortipastoral system supplied highest dry matter of 5.29 tonnes/ha and, pure pasture provided 4.62 tonnes/ha. Medium basin (1.0 m) was most effective for boosting growth of ber, bael. And aonla preferred large basin size (1.5 m) for peak growth. The pasture production was higher in aonla (3.11 tonnes/ha), followed by ber (2.63 tonnes/ha) and bael (2.35 tonnes/ha). Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA at 25, 50 and 100 ppm), diamonium phosphate (2, 4 and 6 kg/ha)a and muriate of potash (2, 4 and 6 kg/ha) applied to foliage at vegetative stage of Dichanthium annulatum improved plant stand and photosynthate assimilation. The combined response of these chemicals resulted in 50% higher seed yield over control (79.256 kg/ha). Crop Protection SPA 2-94022, DM 94016B and 94006B of sorghum have been found resistant to lesion nematode (Pratylenchus zeae) under artificial inoculation. In cowpea, IL 14 and Hy 60 were resistant to Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica. Neem- cake at 1 tonne/ha + seed treatment with Trichoderma harzianum and neem-cake + seed treatment with Thiram (0.25%) + Bavistin (0.2%) gave more than 60% control of root and stem rot diseases. In lucerne, soil treatment with Carbofuran 3G at 1 g/ m-row along with seed treatment with Carbendazim at 1g/kg and spray with neem- seed kernel extract at 3%, 15 days after each cut provided maximum fodder yield (38.19 tonnes/ha), but economically, seed treatment with Carbendazim at 1 g/kg has been found most viable (benefit : cost ratio is 53 : 43). SUCCESS STORY COMPLETE FEED-BLOCKS FOR CATTLE FEEDING The wheat bhusa (40%) was mixed with berseem hay (20%), molasses (20%) and concentrate mix (19%), which included linseed-cake and ground barley at a ratio of 1 : 1, and mineral and vitamins (1%), to produce a complete feed-block (CFB).
