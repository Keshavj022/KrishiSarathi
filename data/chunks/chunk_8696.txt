33/ plot) were higher under inorganic fertilized plots than blast score of 4 and stem- borer incidence score of 7.13 in organically fertilized plots. The compost applied in this experiment contained 0.73% N, 0.42% P and 0.63% K. Vivek Mandua/Madira thresher was designed, fabricated and developed for threshing and pearling grains of finger millet (mandua) and barnyard millet (madira) based on the physical and rheological properties of mandua/madira grains. Crop Protection In all-India co-ordinated trials, lines of rice and wheat showed resistance to major diseases at most of locations. ICAR RESEARCH COMPLEX FOR NEH REGION, UMIAM Crop Improvement An attempt made over the period of last 9 years culminated in the development and release of 4 rice varieties, viz. Bhalum 1 (RCPL 1-29) and Bhalum 2 (RCPL 1- 27) for upland; and Shah Sarang 1 (RCPL 1-87-8) and Lum Pnah 1 (RCPL 1-87-4) for lowland. These varieties developed for both upland and lowland of mid-altitude conditions showed about 65–70% higher yield potential over the existing varieties. Use of Bio-fertilizer A rich harvest of rice cv. RCPL 1-87-4 (3.95 tonnes/ha) could be obtained by curtailing 25% of the recommended dose of N : P : K (80 : 60 : 40 kg/ha) through application of azolla along with FYM @ 5 tonnes/ha. Conservation of Plant Genetic Resources The Institute had collected 1,645 crop germplasm, consisting of 492 rice, 271 maize, 92 other cereals, 343 legumes, 204 oilseeds, 60 fibre crops, 100 vegetables, 38 fruits and 45 spices and sent to the NBPGR for medium- and long-term storage in the National Seed Bank. In addition, an arboretum of 50 important tree species was established at the regional centre of the Institute at Basar, Arunachal Pradesh. Besides, 16 indigenous fruit species, 30 varieties of banana, 31 bamboo species and 26 citrus species were maintained at the regional stations. Vegetables The capsicum grown under protected environments showed much bigger size than the one grown under open condition. An advanced line of tomato was developed, having tolerance to both bacterial wilt and late blight diseases with high production potential. The other advanced lines developed are expected to be released next year. Similarly, out of 7 selection lines of brinjal 5 are in advanced stage of release, of which 2 lines having resistance to bacterial wilt are expected to be released next year. Fruits During the last two decades, the existing orchards are seriously affected by citrus decline. The Institute has developed not only citrus-rejuvenation package in the form of fertilizer schedule, micro-nutrient requirement and disease pest management Rice varieties Bhalum 1 (RCPL 1-29) and Bhalum 2 (RCPL 1-27) developed for upland, gave 65– 75% more yield than the existing cultivars The entire north-eastern region has been known as mega-diversity areas for plant genetic resources.
