METHODS OF WEATHER FORECASTING Experiment The change in weight (gain or loss) recorded daily, during 5 June to 15 September, 2003 and the dates of receipt of rainfall are indicated in Table 2. The data in Table 2 reveal that as and when there were weight gains, it was followed by rainfall. During the dry spells of 3_4 days, both the materials either lost some weight or maintained their weights. The mahua flowers were more sensitive than tamarind fruits in gaining or losing weights in response to the increased or decreased wetness of the atmosphere.
