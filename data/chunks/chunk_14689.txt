 In the past decade, there has been a remarkable global surge in the installation of Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, driven by various government schemes and incentives that have encouraged both individuals and large-scale enterprises to invest in solar power generation. This trend has led to the establishment of solar farms encroaching upon agricultural croplands in regions such as the USA [2], Canada [3], and Europe [4]. Despite the growth in solar energy, the challenge of balancing renewable energy expansion with * Corresponding author. Graduate School of Environment Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.

The United Nations and its member states adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in 2015 (www.unfoundation.org), marking a critical turning point for countries to promote renewable energy production. This led to switching the focus from coal-based generation to PV Solar Energy [5]. India is the third largest producer and consumer of electricity in the world [6]. However, only 10 % of its electricity consumption is covered by PV solar power, and only 25 % of its consumption is covered by all renewable sources combined (www.renewablesindia.in/). The National Solar Mission launched in 2010 is a strong component of the national action plan for climate change [7]. In the last decade, solar panel installation in the country has been rising drastically from merely 141 in 2010 to 40,085 in 2021 (Fig. 1). As of 2021, the installed capacity of the country is around 40 GW s [6]. This is a small portion of what the country has set the target for, that is of 280 GW by the year 2030 [8]. Previously, India has fulfilled its set target four years prior the schedule [9]. Over the coming years, it is expected that the overall installation expenses will decrease as a result of declining PV prices, and the land footprint required for utility-scale PV systems is also projected to shrink due to rapid technological advancements [10]. Some ambitious initiatives like ‘One Sun, One World, One Grid’ bring more possibilities in exceeding the goal [11]. The idea of the project is to connect 140 countries around the world with a common grid, especially the countries lying on the equatorial belt, to get the maximum out of solar energy. India already exports electricity to its neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan [12]. This project may further boost motivation to invest into solar energy as it can boost further economic growth.
