 Thus, it can be suggested that continuous retention of crop residues under CA could improve K supply to crops and in turn help in minimizing the input cost with respect to imported K fertilizers. Future research can be carried out regarding optimization of K input rate in CA based management practices. Study on potassium balance and changes in mineralogical make up of soil under CA may further provide valuable information in this aspect. Nevertheless, it is recommended that, the farmers’ especially practicing cereal based cropping systems in North-West India should adopt CA management practice for better immediate as well as sustained K availability.
