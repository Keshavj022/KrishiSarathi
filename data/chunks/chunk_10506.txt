 In 1996, the much-celebrated Indo- Israel Centre for Protected Cultivation was established at IARI with ICAR-Israel joining hands for contributing to its development. Later, Centre of Excellence (CoE) for Horticulture were established in collaboration with Israel, Netherland and Germany under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH). These CoE serve as demonstration and training centre for latest technologies and source of planting material for horticulture development. Israel and Netherlands provided technical support and training to the Indian participants/ technical personnel while financial support for establishing the COEs was provided by the Centre Government and States. The funding support of 8 million Euros are committed by GIZ under Indo-German collaboration. The land for CoEs is provided by the State Governments.
