 ● ●● ●● Information available on requirement of feed and nutrients for animals in different states ● Silkworm pupae protein proved good source of bypass protein ● Fungi Orpinmyces spp from cattle rumen has the potential to enhance nutritive value of wheat and paddy straw ● New byproducts resources were developed for inclusion in cattle diet ● Fungal zoospores were more on high roughage compared to high concentrate diets ● Defaunation of animals resulted in better nitrogen utilization ● Water-splashing 3-times a day reduced age at first service and age at first calving ● Cheap pelleted feed developed for goats ● Different types of feeders and waters were developed to check feed wastage ● Mustard straw-based complete feed blocks prepared for sheep ● Dietary sodium bicarbonate supplementation improved the nutrient utilization ● Nutritional package of practices for quails by the CARI ● Guar chara, khejri and urea supplementation resulted in increased fibre digestibility ● Local fodder trees were identified to species level in North east zone ● Rations prepared for mithun ● Soybean-meal completely replaced mustard-meal in broiler rabbit diet ● Area specific mineral supplements developed to overcome the deficiency in that region LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 111 Gossypol content of cottonseed did not affect its protein degradability and feeding of cottonseed maintained the plasma level of β carotene and vitamin E. Growth performance of calves fed either mustard or taramira-cake was comparable. Niacin supplementation at 100 ppm level in in vitro studies was beneficial for enhancing TVFA concentration and TCA-ppt N and IVDMD in buffaloes. BYPRODUCT RESOURCES New byproducts resources which may become potential feed supplement are under trial in Andaman and Nicobar, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Punjab and Tamil Nadu. Patent was filed on a simple, quick and sensitive method for staining of proteins on nitrocellulose membrane by the NDRI, Karnal. The NDRI, Karnal, has also assessed following technologies for transfer to the field: ● Using local feeds, one low cost concentrate mixture (rice barn 15%, wheat bran 15%, maize 18%, mustard-cake 15%, linseed-cake 15%, gram chuni 10%, masur chuni 10%, salt 1% and lime 1%) was formulated. It was suitable for sustainable milk production in north Bihar (Patna, Nawda, Gaya, Nalanda, Aurangabad, Bhojpur, Rohtas, Saran, Siwan, Gopalganj, Champaran East and West, Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Sitamari, Darbhanga, Samastipur, Madhubani, Begusarai, Saharsa, Purnea and Katihar). ● A low cost concentrate mixture (rice bran 25%, wheat bran 5%, maize 18%, mustard-cake 20%, linseed-cake 10%, gram chuni 20%, salt 1% and lime 1%) was formulated. It was suitable for sustainable milk production in Santhal Parganas, Hazaribagh, Giridhi, Dhanbad, Ranchi, Palamou and Singbhum (Jharkhand).
