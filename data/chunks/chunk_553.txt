 The yield of crops, MEY, NRs and WP with relay cropping legume crop berseem were enhanced compared without relay cropping. Like- wise, MEY and NRs were greater with paddy-mustard followed by greengram-mustard, pearl millet- mustard and lowest with fallow- mustard grown in berseem as relay cropping in mustard; thus, it is considered the best practice to maintain soil fertility, food security, and profitability. As per our findings, the mustard crop establishment and relay cropping of legume crop berseem in mustard have overall beneficial and wide scope for its adoption in similar agro-ecologies. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: ypsinghkvk@gmail.com FP, Farmers’ practice; IP, Relay cropping berseem in standing mustard; technology impact based on sample survey during 2020–21 in Morena district, minimum support price of grain in INR(`) for year 2018–19 and 2020–21 for mustard @ `40,000 and 46,500/tonne and berseem (local market) `90,000 and 120,000/tonne, respectively.

Indian Farming 11 August 2023 Compendium of success stories of farmers practising natural farming in Himachal Pradesh Ishita Mandla* and Subhash Sharma* Dr. Yashwant Singh Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Nauni, Solan, Himachal Pradesh 173 230 India is an agrarian economy and ranks second in the world in terms of agricultural production. To double the income of farmers by 2022, government has realigned its interventions from a production- centric approach to farmers’ income-centric initiatives. The present day agricultural activities rely on costly inputs like chemical fertilizers and quality seeds for improving yield; however, this comes at the cost of economic viability and environmental degradation in the long run. Himachal Pradesh government is determined to increase farmers' income and their long-term welfare. They also launched the 'Natural Farming Happy Farmer' scheme in the year 2018. In its very first budget, the government has implemented 'Subhash Palekar Natural Farming' method under this scheme to reduce the use of chemicals in farming.
