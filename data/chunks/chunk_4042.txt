In future, rootstock breeding needs to get higher focus. Public Private Partnership projects: Although private sector in India has become part of several consortiums through APSA and World Vegetable Centre (WVC), Taiwan under which projects on tomato, chillies, cucurbits have been running since 2003 with great success. The germplasm and breeding lines are used by Private sector breeders to introgress in their lines and and hence helped them develop new hybrids. WVC has conducted an independent survey among private sector breeders to know how their germplasm was utilized. A summary table from a study is presented in Table 1. It is recommended that a similar study be done by ICAR and Universities to gauge how their research is utilized by Private sector. The author mentions this as he is too many times asked that private sector doesn’t reveal how they have utilized the germplasm from public sector in India. In authors’ view public sector germplasm has certainly been used by private sector in their pedigree and back crossing programs and those projects lead to new pedigrees that become parents of their commercial hybrids. It is generally a 4 to 5 years process before a new hybrid becomes commercial. A study in the right way can help public sector to get good feedback on this issue. This may help remove the trust deficit between the two sectors and lead to developing pre-breeding projects in mutual partnership. These projects will use wild relatives of each crop of importance to unearth new sources of biotic and abiotic resistance, higher nutritional quality; understand their genetics, discover molecular markers for these new traits and then these can get used by breeders to develop the hybrids and varieties of future. It is time for brainstorming on this very important aspect of crop improvement in vegetables and come up with action plans as quickly as possible. SUMMARY In vegetable crops, the private sector has had an immense contribution to the farmers and consumers in India. They have done so by following targeted breeding and developed the downstream activities that involve germplasm development, Inbred and hybrid development, product development by setting up a robust testing platform, a parent seed department to handle increasing breeders’ seeds of parents based on a business plan, a rock-solid seed production platform that involves a large organization and partnership with seed producing farmers.
