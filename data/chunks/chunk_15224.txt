 This accessibility makes these technologies viable for farmers of all scales, including small- holders, allowing them to beneﬁt from modern agricultural practices and gain access to global markets. By promoting responsible and efﬁcient resource management, smart sensor technologies contribute to sustainable agriculture. Reduced chemical usage, improved water conservation, and enhanced soil health are vital components of environmental steward- ship and contribute to the preservation of ecosystems and biodiversity. So adopting smart sensor technologies in mod- ern agriculture is essential for enhancing productivity, pro- moting sustainability, and addressing the challenges of food security in a rapidly changing world. Figure 1 shows the sig- niﬁcant element of precision agriculture. The integration of these advanced sensors with data analytics and other modern technologies empowers farmers with valuable insights and tools to optimize their practices, conserve resources, and ensure a resilient and prosperous agricultural sector for gen- erations to come. Smart sensors play a central role in precision farming, revolutionizing traditional agricultural practices by introducing data-driven decision-making and targeted inter- ventions. The core principle of precision farming is to treat each section of the ﬁeld as a distinct entity, acknowledging that different areas have speciﬁc needs and requirements. Smart sensors deliver critical data on various agronomic parameters, allowing farmers to oversee and control their crops and ﬁelds with an unmatched level of accuracy and effectiveness. The integration of smart sensors with precision farming practices ushers in a new era of efﬁcient and intelli- gent agriculture, shaping the future of food production for a growing global population. The purpose of the review article “Smart Sensors for Precision Agriculture: Recent Innova- tions and Future Perspectives” is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the role of smart sensors in pre- cision agriculture. The review aims to explore the recent advancements and emerging trends in smart sensor technol- ogies that have revolutionized modern agricultural practices. By examining the integration of smart sensors with precision farming techniques, the article intends to shed light on their transformative impact on the agricultural sector. The scope of the review encompasses a wide range of topics related to smart sensors in precision agriculture. It delves into various types of smart sensors used in agricultural applications, including soil sensors for soil health monitoring, crop health sensors for disease detection, pest monitoring, and stress 2 Journal of Sensors assessment, as well as weather and environmental sensors for climate monitoring. Additionally, the article explores the advancements in smart sensor technologies, such as minia- turization, and energy efﬁciency, which have enabled wide- spread adoption across diverse farming practices.
