 Yield and economics On an average, 800-1000 kg per hectare seed yield of isabgol is obtained. However, higher seed yield of about 1500 kg per hectare can be obtained from medium textured soils with better crop management practices. Isabgol straw yield is twice of the seed yield and about 1200-1600 kg per hectare is generally obtained. Following all the good cultivation practices, isabgol cultivation costs about ` 15,000 and gives net return of ` 20,000 from one hectare crop. In a study in Madhya Pradesh, the cost of cultivation was estimated to be ` 49514, 32237 and 163384 for isabgol, wheat and garlic, respectively. Regarding cost of production, it was ` 4112.45, 978.95 and 8972.23 under isabgol, wheat and garlic crop, respectively. The data revealed that the net income was ` 45313, 20003 and 28506 for isabgol, wheat and garlic crop, respectively. The B:C ratio was 1:1.95, 1:1.62 and 1:1.17 for isabgol, wheat, and garlic crop, respectively, which indicates that the isabgol crop was more profitable than their competitive crops. On the basis of findings, it was suggested that more efforts are required to motivate the farmer to include more area of isabgol crop (seed and husk) in the existing Indian Horticulture 14 cropping pattern by the farmers so as to have more chance to improve economic condition of the farmers. Market demand The production of isabgol is demand driven but solely depends on the climatic conditions. Every year about 90,000 tonnes of isabgol is required to be produced in order to meet the domestic demand. From high fibre breakfast cereals, breads and ice cream to medicines, isabgol is now a popular ingredient with food product designers. Isabgol export is growing at 15% every year, and now India dominates the world market in the production and export of isabgol (80% share). Isabgol husks and industrial powders are exported to the countries like USA, UK, France, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Canada, Mexico, Sweden, Spain, Norway, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Korea, Pakistan, Gulf countries and some other small countries. Price trend The prices are influenced by the demand and supply condition. However, the previous years’ stock plays an important role in the determination of prices. The unbranded psyllium husk is highly sensitive to the demand‐supply gap. However, branded and value-added processed husk are less price sensitive in international market due to the cartel of importers’ pressure. Export demand India has the largest market share in the production, processing and export of psyllium husk among all the contributing countries. Isabgol seeds may be marketed as a whole, or the husks may be sold separately. Isabgol husk is brought by the pharma and drugs companies. India exports isabgol seeds and husk worth more than ` 35 million annually. Out of total production, 75% from Gujarat and about 90% from Rajasthan is exported with nearly 93% of being husk.
