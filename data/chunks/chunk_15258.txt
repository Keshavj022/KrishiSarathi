 Journal of Sensors 23 The importance of smart sensors in transforming agricul- ture practices cannot be underestimated. Their ability to provide real-time data, enable precision farming, enhance resource efﬁciency, and empower data-driven decision- making makes them indispensable tools for modern agricul- ture. As technology continues to advance, smart sensors will play an even more critical role in shaping the future of farm- ing, ensuring sustainable and resilient agricultural practices to meet the challenges of a growing global population and changing environmental conditions.
