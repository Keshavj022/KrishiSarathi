METHODOLOGY The experiment consisting of 4 treatments (plots) was laid out in rainy (kharif) season of 2002–03. The treatments were farmers’ practice, maize + sesame 1:2, maize sole 60 cm apart and sesame sole 30 cm apart. Maize variety Girija Composite and LTK-4 (Rajeshwari) sesame were used in the study. Experiments were conducted at two sites, viz. University Research Station (Site I) and farmers’ field (Site II). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results are given in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. The data presented in Table 1 reveal that intercropping treatment did not influence plant height of maize at both the locations and leaf area index at location - II. However, maize + sesame (1:1) intercropping system recorded compared to f armers’ practice. Days taken to flowering (tasselling) was also not affected significantly due to different treatments.Maizealone took maximum number of days for maturity in sole maize.
