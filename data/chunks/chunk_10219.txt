 Indian Agriculture after Independence 78 Within a short period of time, Indian breeders released high-yielding varieties of wheat with superior yield, quality, and resistance to major diseases. Landmark wheat varieties such as SD 227, C 306, and Sonalika changed the prospects for higher harvest in the country. Wheat varieties such as Kalyan Sona, WL 711, WH 147, UP 262, and HD 2189, and HD 2009 were significant contributions along with their production technologies to achieve the green revolution in the country. During 80’s wheat varieties HUW 234, Lok-1, HD 2285, HD 2329 and UP 2338 proved landmarks which with their production technologies had changed the course of the country’s food production. Similar to wheat, Green Revolution brought exponential growth in rice production. In 1966, a new HYV, IR 8 was developed at IRRI Philippines by introgression of a dwarfing gene from the Taiwanese variety Dee -Geo-Woo-Gen. The IR 8 commonly described as the ‘miracle rice’, reached India from the Philippines. The variety had characteristic plant architecture comprised of traits like semi-dwarf stature, photoperiod insensitivity, high fertilizer responsiveness-linked high yield potential, and medium maturity duration. Such unique trait combinations in IR 8 offered an unprecedented opportunity for a rice revolution in the country. Subsequently, breeders developed several rice HYVs, which were better performing than the IR 8. Interestingly, rice cultivation from the unconventional area, the irrigated Indo-Gangetic wheat belt during the late 1960s, helped India to fulfil food-grain requirements. Especially the medium maturing, Basmati-derived, high-yielding fine rice varieties bred at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) (Swaminathan 1993, ICAR 2015) found suitable in an unconventional area such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. 2.2. Yellow Revolution After the Green Revolution in food grain crops, Yellow Revolution in oilseed crops helped India to achieve near self-sufficiency in edible oils during the early 1990s. The intensified efforts in oilseed crops research resulted in a quantum jump in edible oil production from 10.8 Mt (1985-86) to 24.7 Mt (1998-99). Just in a decade period from 1985 to 1996, area under oilseed cultivation increased from 19.0 to 26.0 Mha. Such an increase of 36% in the area resulted in an increase of 125% in production. Similarly, the overall productivity of oilseed crops increased from 570 to 926 kg ha-1. During the Yellow Revolution over 200 varieties were released. The development of HYVs and improved crop technologies helped to achieve significant improvements both in yield and profits to the farmers. As a result of the Yellow Revolution, the edible oil imports declined from Rs. 700 crores in 1985-86 to Rs. 300 crore in 1995-96. The lead in oilseed production during the yellow revolution remained ephemeral as import of edible oil increased considerably from 0.35 Mt (1994-95) to 14.
