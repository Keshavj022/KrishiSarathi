 Four hybrids MH 1001, MH 1109, MH 1169 & MH 1179 exhibited multiple disease resistance against downy mildew and smut diseases at all India level. • Among released hybrids PB 106, 7688 and Shradha and variety JBV 2 have continued to exhibit high downy mildew disease resistance (<1%) across zones in the country. 2003‐04 • Of the 94 entries screened for downy mildew in IHT, 26 entries in zone A and two entries in zone B represented highly resistant category (0‐5%) and of the 56 entries tested in AHT, 21 entries in zone A and a entry in zone B showed highly resistant reaction to downy mildew. While monitoring of downy mildew resistance stability of released hybrids and varieties Pusa 605, ICMH 356, RHB 121, PB 106, 7688, HHB 94, Saburi and HC 10 represented highly resistant category in zone A but none of the entry showed highly resistant reaction in zone B. • In pearl millet disease nursery A, B and R lines, NMS 20A and J 2440 exhibited highly resistant category with 0‐5% disease reaction in zone A. Three lines NMS 20A, ICMB 95444 and ICMB 93222 with 0‐5% disease incidence were observed in zone B. At both zones, NMS 20A showed same trend of highly resistant reaction. • The entries represented highly resistant incidence to downy mildew were also screened for smut, rust, ergot and blast diseases. In PMPT 1, MH 1172, MH 1193, MH 1202, PB 106 (IHT 139). PB 106 (IHT 146) and MH 1228 were highly resistant to smut (0‐10%). None of the above entries showed highly resistant reaction to rust disease. Fourteen and eight entries were highly resistant to ergot and blast. • In PMPT‐II five entries MH 1001, MH 1078, MH 1070, MH 1085 and JBV 2 showed highly resistant reaction to smut. Sixteen entries each for ergot and blast showed highly resistant reaction but none of the entry was found highly resistant to rust. • Of the eight entries highly resistant to downy mildew in PMPT‐III, PB 106 for smut, Sardha and Pusa 383 for ergot, ICMH 356, PB 106 and Pusa 383 for blast were highly resistant but none of the entry showed high resistant incidence to rust. 2004‐05 www.icar.org.in 67 2002 ‐ 2007 • In zone A, 51 entries offered highly resistant category with 0‐5% downy mildew disease incidence in PMPT –I. Interestingly, in zone B, 11 entries viz., MH1192, MH1194, MH1196, MH1201, MH1215, MH1219, MH1139, MH1187, MH1190, PB106 and MP444 recorded highly resistant reaction (0‐5%) and the same entries offered similar reaction in zone A except MH1192 which offered resistant reaction with 7.7% downy mildew disease At 60 DAS, the mean disease incidence for the entries tested ranged between 0.4 to 16.3%. None of the entries showed 0% disease incidence. Hundred and four entries remained in the highly resistant (0‐5%). • In PMPT II, at 30 DAS, the mean performance in different entries for disease incidence ranged between 0.8 to 10.2%. Forty eight entries showed highly resistant reaction. • Among the entries tested in PMPT III, six entries viz.
