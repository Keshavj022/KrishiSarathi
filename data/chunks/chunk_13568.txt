 This progression proved to be highly ameliorative in context of productivity but lead to overutilization of energy inputs and augmented greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) [3]. Undoubtedly, the application of additional energy inputs increases the performance of agricultural systems [4], however, hinders their sustainability. Concerns have grown as a result of the rising price of non-renewable fossil fuels and their diminishing supply, which has sparked an urge for renewable energy alternatives to replace them [2]. For cleaner and more sustainable production, agriculture is rapidly realizing the benefits of effective resource man­ agement and the conservation of nonrenewable energy sources [5,6]. A thorough analysis of the local circumstances, available energy sources, skills, and demands is necessary to evaluate alternate types of energy with lower production costs and higher agricultural productivity [7]. The development and deployment of energy-saving technologies for agricultural production are urgently needed in light of the depleting natural resource base [8,9]. As a result, energy analysis serves as the foundation for wise management and policy choices aimed at resource conservation and effective management of limited resources for increased agricultural output [7] In India, agriculture accounts for 18% of the total GHGE which is attributable to the increased fertilization rates, and pesticides [10]. This percentage is expected to exhibit a further upsurge owing to the addi­ tional pressure of increasing food production to feed the increased * Corresponding author.

These GHGE especially, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), drives the earth’s temperature warming which poses substantial threat to agriculture [12]. Since these elevated temperatures further causes various biotic and abiotic stresses which alters the microclimates of plants, affects photosynthesis, and other yield limiting factors such as water and nutrient use efficiencies [13–15]. Quantifying the amplitude of GHGE from agriculture could aid policymakers to frame strategies for lowering the future emissions, managing carbon credit norms, imparting agricultural sustainability, spreading knowledge on reducing carbon footprints, and helping farmers adopt less carbon intensive farming methods [16,17]. To ach­ ieve optimal resource utilization, the selection of a new system must be accompanied by an adequate number of sustainability indicators, including environmental, energy, and economic metrics [18,19].
