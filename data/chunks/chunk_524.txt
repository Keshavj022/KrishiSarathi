The state has already started promoting kiwifruit cultivation in recent years, and the crop has shown good performance in some regions. In Himachal Pradesh, the mid-hills and valleys of Solan, Shimla, Sirmaur, Mandi and Kullu districts are ideally suited for kiwifruit cultivation.

The Himachal Pradesh Horticulture Development Society (HPHDS) provides technical and financial assistance to farmers for setting up kiwifruit orchards and other horticultural activities.
