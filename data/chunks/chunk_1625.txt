Study showed that high serum FFA and low leptin levels could be the plausible indicators of negative energy balance (NEB) in buffaloes. A total of 509 and 332 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified in the liver and adipose tissues, respectively, between heifers and early lactation (15th and 30th day) buffaloes by NGS analyses. Functional annotation and network analyses of DEG revealed that the immune tolerance and insulin resistance are the major adaptive mechanisms in the liver and adipose tissues, respectively, in buffaloes during early postpartum. The transcriptome data were further supported by proteomics data. On the basis of Bos Taurus genome, a total of 1,39,964 and 1,58,688 intergenus SNPs were identified from the liver and adipose transcriptome data, respectively. A total 368 intragenus SNPs in 317 genes were identified from the liver and adipose tissue transcriptome data. Genetic transformation and development of elite transgenic maize (Zea mays L.) for biotic and abiotic stresses tolerance: Novel plant transformation constructs capable of imparting herbicide tolerance and the required modules or components were used for development of elite transgenic maize. Transformation via biolistic and agro-mediated methods were undertaken. A novel method for in-vitro regeneration from nodal explants of tropical maize inbred (KDM varieties from SKAUST) and hybrid (K65 variety) lines were optimized. Amongst them, K65 variety exhibited robust Type II embryogenic calli in the modified media. Constructs employing CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing of native EPSPS was designed at International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) for nutritional improvement of crops. More than 7000 immature embryos were harvested from field grown CM300 inbred line and cultured on callus induction media. The embryogenic calli were transformed with CRISPR/Cas9 based EPSP gene editing construct for herbicide tolerance. These putative transgenic plants were screened through PCR using Cas9 gene- specific primers. Maize transformation with already available codon optimized Cry1Ac gene construct and the T1 putative transformants were analysed to develop stem borer resistant maize transgenic, codon optimized Cry1Ac gene construct was used for transformation of embryogenic maize callus of inbred line VQL2 at VPKAS. For herbicide resistance, 300 calli were bombarded with gene editing construct of CRISPR/Cas9 along with EPSPS sgRNA. In all, sixty-seven plants were regenerated, which were confirmed by PCR analysis.
