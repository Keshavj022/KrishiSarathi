 Agricultural Education and Agricultural Research Agricultural Education and Research have to be focused more on the society’s needs. It has to take more of changes due to globalization, technological development and growing emphasis on value addition. The thrust areas and strategies to be achieved have to be prioritized taking into consideration of positive impact and spin- off benefits. Challenges:   Agricultural education to cater to the globalizing agriculture needs.   Crop improvement research on developing new varieties, hybrids and also to possess important traits such as drought tolerance, pest and disease resistance and nutrient enrichment especially in nutritional cereals.   Standardizing precision farming technologies for more crops which will help to increase yield of quality produce and conserve resources.   Strengthening research to develop implements and machinery considering the needs of the farming community, particularly marginal and small farmers besides paying attention to designing gender-friendly implements.   Research activities to reduce post-harvest losses and to enhance value addition and emphasis to be given for nutritional cereals so that their consumption level increases.   Developing bio technology and nanotechnology based solutions for enhancing input use efficiency, productivity, post-harvest life, value addition and maintaining resource quality.   Research on Bio inoculants to augment nutrient availability and to reduce pest incidence Rhizosphere engineering to enhance soil plant relationship   Further intensification of research on climate change and mitigation   Market research to promote market-led agriculture.   The hiatus in agriculture is mainly due to deteriorating soil health, declining water resources, inadequate investment in rural infrastructure, spiraling prices of inputs and change in the mind sets of people viewing of agriculture as of low value. Hence farmer farm oriented, crop focused, region specific strategies with adequate investment in developing rural structure is absolutely essential. In sum, the desired growth rate can be achieved only through crop based technology interventions along with genetically improved seeds and newer technologies along with timely availability of inputs. In addition, development of value added process especially in millets and horticultural produces with market driven approach should be given priority. Under infrastructure development, weather proofing of food 496 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 grain production, linking the river as much as economically possible to bring surplus water of one area to other, micro- irrigation, high efficiency of water, nutrients and energy are to be addressed. Strict enforcement to avoid encroachment of the existing of tanks and also the inlet channels should be given due consideration.
