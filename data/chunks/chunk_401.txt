Inter-venial chlorosis occurs from tip to base of leaves due to iron deficiency. Boron deficiency occurs on young leaves of sugarcane with distorted leaves and causes death of apical meristem.

In tropical zone, seed cane is fertilized with 75 to 100% of recommended dose of nitrogen in 2-4 equal splits depending upon soil texture, irrigation practice followed and the variety grown. In sub- tropical zone, with wide variability in edaphic, environmental and management conditions, the seed cane needs 25% additional N over recommended doses of N, P and K. Application of total nitrogen may be phased out in 4 equal splits for realizing beneficial effects in terms of yield and quality (Table 2).
