 Therefore, in the context of the above discussion, it is quite apparent that appropriate management strategies should be adopted to maintain and further enhance the carbon reserve in wetlands for the sake of protecting the earth from global warming and climate change. Management practices to protect C- stores in wetland • Conservation of wetlands and their sustainable use as natural habitats • Restoration of degraded wetlands and creation of new wetlands • Control drainage and other land and water management practices which lead to dewatering of wetlands and oxidation • Control fires including deep burns • Allow natural revegetation to occur • Control peat harvesting and other removals of carbon from wetlands • Public awareness and legal protection Indian scenario India has a vast area under wetland. The flood plain area covers around 0.55 million ha. Besides, there are about 0.72 million ha upland lakes. The flood plain wetlands are mostly spread in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and few other North-Eastern states like Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, and Tripura. The soils of most of these wetlands have a high concentration of carbon (~4-10%) as compared to agricultural/upland soils. As part of an adaptation and mitigation strategy for climate change due to global warming, at our institute we attempted to find out the carbon sequestration potential of different wetlands by measuring primary carbon capture and ultimate carbon accumulation in soils of different wetlands in West Bengal and Assam through our work under National Innovation on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) Table 1.

The net algal primary productivity of these wetlands varied from 150–880 mg-C/m3/h which can add 4.21-24.67 Mg-C/ha/year (tonnes/ha/year).
