IC0641991 21206 Huskless genotype with high thousand grain (43.5 g) weight, in combination of bold grain percentage (63.2%) and protein content (14.7%). IC0641992 21207 Huskless resistant for stripe rust at APR and for new pathotypes 6S0 and 7S0 at SRT and also having starch content. IC0641989 22013 High hectoliter weight (66.7 kg/hl) coupled with higher protein content 13.0% (dwb) and bold grains (>2.5 mm size). IC645765 22074 High bold grain proportion in six rowed hulless barley as indicated with higher 1000 grain weight and bold grains percentage (76.7%). IC645770 22075 Hulless barley with combination of high grain beta glucan (7.0%) and protein (16.6%) content. Barnyard millet (Echinochloa esculenta) IC643966 22034 Glumeless florets and seeds. IC640691 21127 Highly resistant to grain smut disease.

Maximum essential oil content (0.28%). Maximum eugenol content (60%),β-caryophyllene (14%) and β-elemene content (14%). IC643990 22054 Light green new leaf margin with club type purple coloured inflorescence. Maximum essential oil content (0.50%) in herbage. Maximum Linalool (32.13%), β-elemene (2.53%) and Germacrene D (3.32%) content. Beetroot, Chukandar (Beta vulgaris var. bengalensis) IC0632944 22086 Delayed bolting habit by 16-33 days favours 1-2 more number of cutting (s) during year round sowing; and have faster plant growth, i.e. 15.4% higher biomass production per cutting during round-the-year cultivation. Heat tolerance: Produces luxurious plant growth by tolerating high temperature, i.e. average temperature maxima of 39-43°C during April to June. Wide adaptability: VRPLK 2 produces higher marketable biomass yield, i.e. 136- 887 q/ha during round the year monthly sowing which is 56-147% higher than standard check variety because of delayed bolting habit, faster plant growth and heat tolerance.
