 These seven compounds (1H3MAQ and six derivatives) were checked for direct antifungal activity against various plant pathogenic fungi like Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus niger, Phytophthora infestans and Botrytis ricini. The parent compound demonstrated reduction in fungal growth in comparison to the other analogs. Diapausing and nondiapausing spotted stem borer in sorghum and maize: Studies were conducted on development and survival of non-diapausing C. partellus populations from different agro-ecological regions on different maize genotypes; and the larvae feeding on these genotypes were profiled for variability in various amino acid and the lipophilic compounds. These studies revealed significant variation in biological parameters on various genotypes, which could be due to existence of genetically diverse C. partellus populations in different agro-climatic zones of India. The C. partellus larvae of different populations reared on various maize genotypes revealed significant differences in amounts and proportions of different amino acids and the lipophilic compound. The lipophilic profiling of C. partellus larvae showed that the Hisar population of C. partellus reared on susceptible maize genotype (Basi Local) had significantly higher amount of oleic acid, and significantly and positively associated with larval growth. Myristic acid, palmitoleic acid and oleic acid in different C. partellus populations reared on CPM 19 were significantly and negatively associated with larval survival. These biochemical compounds have implications for nutritional physiology, development and survival, and play important role in plant resistance to C. partellus in maize. Adaptive mechanisms and captive breeding in hilsa: Hilsa was successfully bred with 98% fertilization. The eggs were incubated in the laboratory in glass aquaria using filtered pond water. Larvae were reared in outdoor FRP tanks. During 46 days of rearing period, larval survival was achieved up to 61.3 % at lowest stocking density (300 m-3). Hilsa was cultured in two ponds of 0.1 ha each at 15,000 and 30,000/ha stocking density, where fish grew to 134.71 mm/ 24.63 g and 119.7 mm/14.64 g from the initial size of 29.5 mm/0.27 g during 300 days of culture period. Hilsa fry could be weaned to accept artificial feed under pond culture condition. Transportation trial of eggs and larvae of hilsa revealed that the survival of eggs and larvae at 100 and 50 nos./litre were 80 and 98%, respectively. After 31 months of culture, hilsa attained average growth of 383.80±27.38 g/ 339.33±9.68 mm from initial body weight/length of 1.37±0.18 g / 52.97±5.50 mm. Significant number of matured female (358.18g- 425.52g/ 352mm- 370mm) with V- stage of oocyte maturation and matured male (139.35 g/260 mm) in the cultured pond were found during October- November and January-February after 2 years of culture indicating possibility of brood stock maturation in captivity.
