 The adult GFY of males and females were 0.846 kg and 0.582 kg, respectively, during spring whereas in autumn, GFY in males and females were 0.957 kg and 0.721 kg respectively. The pooled GFY was 0.771 kg. The 6 monthly wool yield was 0.462 kg. Staple length was 2.75 cm, diameter 20.14µ and medullation 1.5%. The preweaning survivability was 54.23%. Chokla: At the CSWRI, Avikanagar, average annual wool yield was about 2 kg. Average body weight at birth, 6 and 12 months of age were 2.72, 16.76 and 23.52 Elite sheep flock Marwari sheep, was developed as a carpet wool breed through selection l Twin lambing in Garole × Malpura strain improved to 52%. l Milk yield and body weight at marketable age of Jamunapari, Barbari and Sirohi goats improved. l Rabbits weaned at 28 days of age showed highest daily weight gain. l Strain cross developed at CARI produced 301.8 eggs, 3-times higher than commercial strains. l Feed requirement in layer birds reduced by 174 g to produce one dozen eggs. l Synthetic broilers attained 944 g at five weeks of age. l Caribro-Dhanraj weighed 1,595 g at 7 weeks of age. l Poultry germplasm adapted well in different agro climatic conditions. l Phenotypic and genetic responses for economic traits in quails studied. l Turkey birds performed well in huts. l Breed affected the growth in camels. l Calving was highest in Kachchhi camel. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 102 kg respectively. Overall survivability of the block was 93%. Annual lambing (based on ewe available) was 93%. Mutton Production Malpura: Overall means for birth, 3, 6 and 12 month body weight were 2.92, 12.51, 20.18 and 29.28 kg in Malpura. The twin lambing in Garole × Malpura ewes was 52%, and it was 19% higher compared to previous year.The Malpura ewes gave birth to mostly single lambs except 4% twin lambing. Survivability in Garole × Malpura genetic group was almost at par with that of Malpura. Network Project on Sheep Improvement Improvement in fleece weight and body growth in Muzaffarnagri sheep: At the CIRG, Makhdoom, the Muzaffarnagri sheep was improved for faster growth and high feed conversion efficiency. It is one of the best mutton breeds in India and is widely distributed in the semi-arid region of western Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, and in some parts of Delhi and Haryana. Selection of males was done on the basis of 6-months body weight and first clip greasy fleece weight. Under semi-intensive feeding system the average body weights of animals, maintained at birth, 3, 6 and 9 months body weight were 2.99 ± 0.05, 14.65 ± 0.32, 22.95 ± 0.66, 25.65 ± 0.66 and 29.57 ± 0.91 kg, respectively. The average daily weight gains of animals were 385.55 ± 9.54 and 52.09 ± 1.71 g at pre- and post-weaning ages. The least-squares means of greasy fleece yield at first clip (6 month) and second clip (12 month) were 423.98 ± 8.01 and 494.75 ± 10.96 g. The adult annual wool yield was 1,248.15 ± 32.10 g. Animals under intensive system of management weighed 14.17 ± 0.43 and 23.
