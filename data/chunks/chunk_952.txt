 Based on two years adaptive trial conducted at various locations of Bihar, IET 24306 has recorded mean grain yield 5.26 t/ha and showed yield advantage of 12.6% over check variety. Swarna Samriddhi Dhan shows high response to fertilizer application compared to checks. Yield reduction and yield gain at 50 and 150% of recommended nitrogen level showed that normal does of nitrogen is most productive for this culture at most of locations (120– 150 kg N/ha) depending on native soil fertility. However, significant response was noticed up to 120:60:40 kg/ha (N:P: K). Swarna Samriddhi Dhan is a semi-dwarf (100–105 cm) genotype which flowers in about 100–110 days and matures in 135–140 days. The genotype IET 24306 has shown non-lodging plant type and produce thick culm. The optimum time for nursery raising of Swarna Samriddhi Dhan is from 2nd to 3rd week of June, but it should be adjusted for a particular location. Seed rate of around 25–30 kg/ha is recommended for Swarna Samriddhi Dhan. A 25 to 30 days old seedling should be used for transplanting. The transplanting should be done at a spacing of row to row 20 cm and plant to plant 15 cm with 1 or 2 seedlings per hill. Application of pre-emergence herbicide within a week of transplanting is advisable. If required application of post emergence (POE) herbicide bispyribac sodium @25 g/ha at 3–4 leaf stage of weeds between 20–25 Panicles of Swarna Samriddhi Dhan Kernels and grains of Swarna Samriddhi Dhan Indian Farming 11 February 2023 days after transplanting (DAT) may be done. If required one or two hand/mechanical weeding at 40 and 60 DAS (days after sowing) may be done. Inter-cultivation operation may be carried out when needed for effective and better weed management. Water management Normal irrigation like other transplanted rice variety is recommended. Swarna Samriddhi being a drought tolerant rice variety does not require more water if rainfall is normal and well distributed. However, under water scarcity/drought condition, field should be irrigated at critical stages like active tillering, panicle initiation, flowering and grain filling. Reaction to major diseases and insect pests Swarna Samriddhi Dhan (IET 24306) has resistance to false smut and moderately resistance to leaf blast, brown spot, sheath blight, rice tungro disease (RTD), and glume discoloration diseases under natural screening. Under artificial screening, it also showed resistance to leaf blast. Although rice variety Swarna Samriddhi Dhan has tolerance to major disease, regular monitoring of the crop is advisable to know the disease appearance and need based management is needed. Seed treatment with fungicides, carbendazim 50 WP @2 g/kg seed or tricyclazole 75 WP @1.5 g/kg seed is advisable to reduce intensity of fungal diseases.
