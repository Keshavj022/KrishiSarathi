 By establishing a properly managed village hatchery unit with a suitable incubator, proper facilities, and trained personnel, poultry farmers can achieve a sustainable and efficient hatching process, thereby supporting the overall growth and productivity of their poultry farming operations. Care and management of chicks Brooding of chicks For poultry farming, artificial brooding is essential. Here are steps to set up an effective brooding system. Brooder house preparation: Disinfect the brooder house before introducing chicks. Create a brooding area using cardboard, plastic, or steel sheets, forming a circle with a 6-foot diameter and 16-inch height. Cover the floor with several inches of dry rice husk or newspaper. Ensure the area is protected from direct sunlight. Heating: For every 100 chicks, use 250W infrared lamps to keep them warm. Divide the lamps so each brooding Eggs shifted from setter to hatcher Shifting the chicks from hatcher to brooder Indian Farming 30 November 2024 house has one light bulb. Avoid heating the entire room; focus on the brooding area where the chicks are. Space requirements: Each chick (1-8 days old) requires 6-7 inches of free space in the brooding house. Provide feed and water immediately upon the chicks’ arrival using small drinkers and feeders. Temperature and lighting: Maintain an optimum temperature of 95°F in the first week, reducing it by 5°F per week until reaching 70°F by the sixth week. Two- watt heat is needed per chick upto 6 weeks. Provide continuous light for at least 48 hrs initially, then 10-12 hrs during the growing stage (8-18 weeks). For laying periods, reduce light to 15-16 hrs. Use chick guards (15- 18 inches high) placed 3 feet away from the heat source to prevent direct contact. By following these guidelines, farmers can effectively manage and care for their poultry chicks, ensuring healthy growth and reducing mortality rates. Economics of the hatchery unit Establishing a hatchery unit with a capacity of 1,000 eggs involves various costs, including the purchase of equipment, operational expenses, and maintenance. Table 1 provides a detailed overview of the costs, revenues, and profitability associated with establishing and operating a 1,000 egg capacity hatchery unit. Key precautions for establishing and operating hatchery units Site selection and infrastructure • Location: Choose a well-ventilated, dry, and easily accessible location for the hatchery. Avoid areas prone to flooding or extreme temperatures. • Room size: Ensure the room is adequately sized for the capacity of the incubators. For a 1,000 egg capacity unit, a room size of approximately 10×10 feet is usually sufficient. • Ventilation: Proper ventilation is essential to maintain air quality, and regulate temperature and humidity. Install fans and air vents to ensure good airflow. • Power supply: Provide an uninterrupted power supply with backup options (inverters or generators) to ensure continuous operation of incubators.
