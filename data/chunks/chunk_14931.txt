 The feedstock expenses account for 40â€“70% of total production costs, making them the largest cost component. This highlights the importance of optimizing supply chains to enhance efficiency and lower biofuel costs [89]. 7.5.3 Price Competitiveness One of the key economic challenges for renewable fuels is their struggle to compete with subsidized fossil fuels [90]. In countries with abundant fossil fuel resources, bioenergy adoption faces additional difficulties due to the absence of financial support mechanisms, making biofuels comparatively more expensive. 7.5.4 Market Challenges The viability of a bioenergy project often depends on the presence of established markets for its products. If such markets do not already exist, project feasibility may be uncertain. For example, the introduction of biodiesel can be challenging in the absence of blending mandates, just as selling electricity directly to consumers can be difficult without regulatory frameworks for integrating renewable power into the grid. Similarly, promoting pellet-based cooking stoves in regions accustomed to traditional cooking methods may face resistance. When both the market and the project must be developed simultaneously, the risks increase, making it harder to secure financing [91]. Additionally, many bioenergy technologies produce multiple byproducts, each requiring a reliable market for the overall project to succeed. 7.5.5 Data Limitations Accurate and up-to-date data on feedstock availability is essential for bioenergy project planning. However, such data is often scarce, forcing project developers to rely on estimates or outdated information [92]. Conducting a thorough resource assessment is crucial for project feasibility, and regularly collected, publicly accessible government data plays a vital role in facilitating planning, development, and investor confidence. 7.6 Applications of Machine Learning in Thermochemical Conversion of Biomass The complexity of thermochemical conversion processes, characterized by nonlinear parameter interactions and high-dimensional transformations, necessitates advanced mathematical modeling for design, optimization, and process intensification. These models help analyze the influence of various factors on system performance, identify optimal operating conditions, and enable real-time process monitoring, control, and optimization [93]. Traditional modeling approaches based on transport phenomena such as mass, energy, and momentum conservation along with kinetic equations, require extensive experimental efforts, making their implementation time-consuming and resource- intensive. To enhance the efficiency and productivity of thermal conversion processes, significant research has focused on developing advanced modeling methodologies. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for real-time monitoring, process control, yield prediction, and optimization of biomass thermochemical conversion.
