Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): ¾ A software based forecasting model ‘FROGIN” developed for forecasting of haemonchosis for semi‐ arid zone of Rajasthan. ¾ Early detection of haemonchosis as early as ist week post infection in sheep through Dot ELISA with purified ES antigen. ¾ Significant immunoprotection achieved against haemonchosis in sheep utilizing H!! antigen (concealed gut derived antigen). ¾ Nemotophaghous fungi Duddingtonia flagrans evaluated for Biological control. 22 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Animal Sciences www.icar.org.in Network Project on Hemorrhagic Septicemia 1.
