Indian Agriculture after Independence 390 The other institutional intervention to support farmers to meet out their farm expenses has been the approach of direct income transfer. On 24th February 2019, the union Government launched the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme. An amount of Rs. 6,000 is transferred in three installments in a year directly into the farmers’ bank accounts since then. The present statistics show more than 11 crore farmers are benefitting through this scheme, which translates into an expense of Rs. 66 thousand crores to the Government. To note, the rise in subsidy burden over years has not been at the cost of a decline in public sector capital in agriculture. The public sector Gross Capital Formation (GCF) in agriculture, which reflects the investment made in agriculture, was about Rs. 35.7 thousand crores in the year 2011-12. This rose to Rs. 56.2 thousand crores in 2015-16 and to Rs. 76.1 thousand crores in 2019-20. Thus, the centre has extended huge financial support to the welfare of the farmers. Among the states, loan waivers had been the major welfare intervention other than offering electricity at subsidized rates for agricultural purposes. The burden of such waivers on the states’ exchequer had generally been high. Sometimes, the aggregate of waivers in a few states has surpassed the centre’s expenditures on fertilizer subsidies for the entire nation i.e., in the year 2017-18. One shall note that other than these seasonal/irregular waivers in states, the centre spends regularly on credit subsidies as noted earlier. Estimates show that they have risen from around Rs. 2,000 crores in 2009-10 to around Rs. 6,000 crores in 2013-14, and to more than Rs. 12,000 crores in 2015-16. With the expanding credit requirements over years and with the Government’s financial inclusion initiatives, the credit subsidies shall rise further in the coming years. 3.3. Price policies, market reforms, governance and innovations The governance support has evolved parallelly with the developments in agriculture. The acceleration in productivity with the onset of green revolution has brought a transformation in Indian agriculture. Institutions namely the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP) and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) were established in 1965 to assist the farmers with price support operations on one side and ensure the productivity gains reaching the consuming sector through the Public Distribution System (PDS) on the other side. The former institution was mandated to recommend the Government the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) at which the latter institution was obliged to procure food commodities to distribute to the public. The support price act as a safety net to the farmers, notably when the market fails to guarantee reasonable prices to the commodities. At present, the MSP is announced for 14 kharif crops and 10 rabi crops.
