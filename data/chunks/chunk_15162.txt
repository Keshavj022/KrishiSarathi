 When making a classification decision, the approach takes into account solely the category of the sample or samples that exhibit the closest proximity. The KNN approach is only applicable to a relatively limited set of neighboring samples for making category decisions, and it is not well-suited for handling high-dimensional data. In this study, the Minkowski distance formula was selected to compute the distance between neighboring data points. This particular formula has been demonstrated to exhibit superior accuracy compared to other distance metrics. The model was configured with a value of k = 3, indicating that the classification decisions were made based on the three nearest neighbors. 2.3. Training, testing and performance evaluation The use of imbalanced data poses a major challenge in training and testing ML models as biased models tend to produce inaccurate predictions for the minority class. To address this issue, we employed an under-sampling strategy. In order to forecast the optimal Fig. 2.

The training dataset consisted of 70 % of the available data, while the remaining 30 % was reserved for testing purposes. Effective model performance evaluation cannot be achieved solely by using ac­ curacy. To assess the performance of the classifier models, additional model assessment metrics were generated in addition to ac­ curacies, such as recall, specificity, precision, F1-score, and AUC based on [10,43]. AUC is the most efficient indicator for quantifying predictive power and was used to compare the accuracy of predictions. 3. Results 3.1. Requirements for nutrients and environmental factors of agriculture and horticulture crops The plot matrixes show the requirement of NPK along with temperature, humidity, rainfall and soil pH for the cultivation of different agricultural (Fig. 2) and horticultural crops (Fig. 3). The temperature range for agricultural crops is generally narrow; however, certain crops such as black gram, moth bean, mung bean, and muskmelon require a relatively higher temperature. In regions with high humidity, crops such as muskmelon, mung bean, and rice are recommended due to their ability to grow well in such conditions. Conversely, in areas with relatively low humidity, crops such as chickpeas and kidney beans are more suitable for culti­ vation. Mung beans have the unique ability to thrive in a wide range of soil pH levels, unlike many other agricultural crops which typically require a pH range of 6–8. However, it should be noted that kidney beans exhibit a preference for slightly acidic soil.
