 Notably, the access to finance from the commercial banks rose dramatically, from less than a percent in 1951 to more than 35% in 1991. This has enhanced further to 44.5% in the year 2019, due to both the expansion of commercial banks in the rural regions and the Government’s supportive policies towards the farm sector. The composition of credit has also undergone major changes (Table 5). The higher access of finance of farmers from the commercial banks was also complemented with an increased rate of credit delivery over the years. Rather, the role of cooperatives in credit delivery has declined since the RRBs came into operation. From around 50% in the year 1983-84, the share of cooperatives in the total agricultural credit outstanding has declined to just above 13% in 2019-20. On the other side, the share of RRBs has risen from 4.4% to 14.8% during this period, surpassing the credit outstanding of cooperatives. When measured in terms of growth, while the cooperative sectors’ credit outstanding grew annually at the rate of 10.7%, it was 18% in the commercial banks and 19.5% in the RRBs during 1991-2020. 3.2. Subsidies, income transfers and public investment Public institutions both at the centre and states have cushioned throughout the time the risks the farmers faced in agriculture and their efforts to minimize the costs of inputs used in agriculture for higher profit realizations. Subsidies and waivers have been the prime instruments. The centre incurred the subsidy expenses amounting to more than Rs. 81 thousand crores (comprising urea and nutrient-based subsidies) in the year 2019-20 to offer fertilizers at affordable prices (Table 6). The expense was just Rs. 60 crores in 1976- 77. It rose to about Rs. 4.4 thousand crores in 1990-91; to Rs. 13.8 thousand crores in 2000-01; and to 62.3 thousand crores in 2010-11. Similarly, to facilitate higher credit flow, institutional finance is being offered for years at lower interest rates. The Government introduced a subvention rate of 2% in Kharif 2006-07 to the commercial, cooperative, and regional rural banks for the short-term production credit. It introduced an additional 1% in 2009-10, which was hiked to 2% in 2010-11 and 3% in 2011-12. The subvention was extended from crop growing farmers to animal and fish growers since 2018-19. Costs of such inventions have generally been higher. In the year 2019-20, the Government incurred a credit subsidy of more than Rs. 16 thousand crores at this end. Table 6.
