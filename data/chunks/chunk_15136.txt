Considering these concerns, this paper focuses on two pivotal issues: (1) what factors influence the adoption of MI technologies in semi-arid states in India? (2) what are the difficulties and causes of not adopting MI technologies? While prior studies have examined factors and pro­ cesses related to the adoption of drip and sprinkler irrigation across various Indian states (Narayanamoorthy, 2009; Nair and Thomas, 2023), this study specifically focuses on the top ten semi-arid states in India, which heavily depend on agricultural practices. The novelty of this study lies in its thorough analysis of MI technology adoption, of­ fering a deeper comprehension of the intricacies surrounding MI adop­ tion, including the roles of human capital, economic factors, and regional disparities in these semi-arid states. This approach contributes to the literature by presenting actionable policy recommendations to facilitate MI technology adoption, thus bolstering agricultural produc­ tivity, water conservation, and sustainability in developing nations like India. The study aims to identify the primary determinants influencing farmers’ decisions regarding the adoption of irrigation technologies in these semi-arid states in India. Additionally, the study delves into farmers’ viewpoints, barriers, and experiences related to the adoption or non-adoption of MI technologies. This will be accomplished through a series of Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) carried out in the semi-arid region of Andhra Pradesh, situated in southern India. The remaining paper is structured as follows: the next section will outline the empirical model and data used in the study, while Section 3 will explore the empirical results. Section 4 will examine farmers’ per­ ceptions and challenges in adopting MI technologies, using the state of Andhra Pradesh as a case study. Finally, Section 5 will cover conclu­ sions, limitations, and future research directions, followed by Section 6 on policy implications. 2. Material and methods 2.1.
