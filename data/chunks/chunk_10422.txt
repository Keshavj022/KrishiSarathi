14 with internal rate of return of 22% (Joshi et al. 2005). Technology generation on reclamation of problem soils was able to rehabilitate 1.8 Mha of sodic soils, 0.80 Mha of saline soils and 0.1 Mha of waterlogged saline soils. Subsurface drainage technology proved increase in cropping intensity by more than 100% with improvement in yield of paddy (45%), wheat (111%) and cotton (215%). Standardized fertigation schedules have showed promising outcomes with 9-80% higher yield, 11-71% irrigation water saving and 18-25% fertilizer saving in various crops grown under varying soil textural classes across the country. ICAR flexi check dam (Rubber Dam) for watershed Indian Agriculture after Independence 278 resulted in enhancement of rice productivity (22 to 62%), pulse productivity (46%) and vegetable productivity (22 to 48%) besides increase in cropping intensity (31%), cultivated land utilization index (40%), multiple cropping index (152.5-190%) and crop diversification index (0.39 to 0.49) with a benefit cost ratio of 2.30 (Jena 2018). Intervention on neem coating of urea was able to improve the nitrogen use efficiency by 10%. Development of Mridaparikshak helped in distribution of about 28 million soil health cards to the stakeholders. Similarly, a total of 31,891 organic clusters were formed during 2015-16 to 2018-19 to promote organic farming in 2.38 lakh ha area. Likewise, adoption of resource conservation technologies has brought nearly 2.0 Mha area under zero tillage and bed planting in Indo Gangetic Plains. The integrated farming system (IFS) models have been able to ensure food and nutritional security at household level besides making the farming as a profitable venture. On an average, stakeholders could achieve the increase in their income to the tune of 1.5 â€“ 3.6 lakh per annum by adopting IFS. Area under agroforestry land use has been estimated to be 28.427 Mha i.e., 8.65% of the total geographical area of the country. Bio-intensive efficient alternative cropping systems for different agro-climatic zones with potential productivity ranging from 16 to 35 t ha-1yr-1 have also been developed. These alternative systems along with production packages have been included in the Crop Production Guide /package of practices of respective states. The system approach enhanced the resource recycling by 25-30% with increase in rural employment by 25-30% besides enhancement of farm income by 2-3 times. 4. Way forward The past 75 years of independence could saw a significant progress in the field of natural resource management starting from a concept of simple fertilizer response experiments to estimates of greenhouse gas emission and phenomics for crop phenotyping to identify the climate resilient traits. The next phase of research should orient towards reducing the chemical foot prints and studying water foot prints in the system mode approach. The fifth-generation technologies like remote sensing, GIS, artificial intelligence, etc.
