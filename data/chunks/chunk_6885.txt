 Comparative publication citation analysis yy Citation analysis of publications during 2007-2020 was performed using the data retrieved from Web of Science {(SCI-Expanded: http://webofknowledge. com}. The comparisons were made for number of citations during (i) 2007-13 and (ii) 2014-2020: It was observed that from 2007-13 to 2014-20, the total (i) number of publications of ICAR increased to 20381 in 2014-20 from 12596 in 2007-13; (ii) total citations increased to 99318 in 2014-20 from 40343 in 2007-13; (iii) average citation per paper increased to 4.873 in 2014-20 from 3.203 in 2007-13; (iv) impact factor per paper increased to 1.707 in 2014-20 from 1.41 in 2007-13; (v) number of papers in journals with impact factor >4 increased to 68 in 2014-20 from 37 in 2007-13 and (vi) number of papers in journals with impact factor >10 increased to 1958 in 2014-20 from 862 in 2007-13. yy For 2017-20, comparison based on 500 most cited Papers each year (Total of 2000 Publications) on the basis of data retrieved from Science Citation Index-Expanded revealed that (i) citation per paper for 500 most cited papers per year for ICAR is 18.18, whereas for EMBRAPA, Brazil it is 15.07 and (ii) Publications â‰¥50 citations for ICAR, it is 103, whereas for EMPRAPA, Brazil, it is 67. Improved identification of splice sites incorporating secondary structure features: Developed a machine learning based prediction algorithm through which the splice site prediction accuracy can be improved in plant species by incorporating the secondary structures of the nucleotide sequence. For this, the support vector machine was employed for splice site recognition in Arabidopsis thaliana, which is a model plant species. The prediction accuracies were Social Science Citation Analysis of ICAR Publications The comparative analysis of ICAR publications during 2017-20 (4 years) in Science Citation Expanded List 2017-20 with publications of CAAS, China; EMPRAPA, Brazil and CSIRO, Australia was performed. It was observed that for (i) ICAR: Total Publications in Science Citation Index-Expanded: 12481; Total Impact Factor: 22521.446; Citations per Paper: 4.52; h-index: 61 and Impact factor per paper: 1.80, (ii) CAAS, China: Total Papers in SCI-E: 18447; Total IF: 69069.413; Citations per Paper: 7.88; h-index: 85; Impact factor per paper: 3.74, (iii) EMBRAPA, Brazil: Total Papers in SCI-E: 7278; Total IF: 17380.495; Citations per Paper: 5.58; h-index: 55; Impact factor per paper: 2.39, and (iv) CSIRO, Australia: Total Papers in SCI-E: 13487; Citations per Paper: 13.02; h-index: 122. also evaluated with other machine learning methods such as Logit Boost, Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost and XGBoost. The prediction accuracies of SVM, AdaBoost and XGBoost were observed to be at par and higher than that of RF and LogitBoost algorithms.
