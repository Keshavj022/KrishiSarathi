Twelve experimental mustard hybrids have been produced. Of the 300 hybrids evaluated, promising heterotic combinations, based on the standard heterosis for seed yield over the best check, are HB 9912 × HB 9924 (80.7%) and PCR 15 × HB 9925 (42.3%). Crop Production In mungbean-mustard sequence, application of 75% of the recommended dose of fertilizers along with 10 tonnes of farmyard manure/ha was remunerative in north Gujarat. For the semi-arid eastern plains zone of Rajasthan, especially for the soils deficient in sulphur, boron and zinc nutrients, application of recommended dose of fertilizers along with 10 tonnes FYM/ha, 40 kg sulphur/ha, 25 kg zinc sulphate/ha and 1 kg boron/ha, was found remunerative. Crop Protection Seed yield losses due to Alternaria blight, white rust and Sclerotinia rot can be reduced substantially if sowing of mustard is done in the third week of October and seeds are treated with Apron 35 SD (6 g/kg). Ridomil MZ 72 WP (0.25%) may be sprayed immediately after the appearance of the white rust, followed by two sprays of Mancozeb (0.2%) at fortnightly intervals. The genotypes Bio YSR, Bio 467-95, PWR 9541, EC 399299, EC 399301 and JMMWR 941-1-2 showed consistent resistance to white rust, and PAB 9511, EC 399303, EC 399315 and EC 41439 showed tolerance for Alternaria blight. These can be used as resistant donors in varietal improvement. SOYBEAN Crop Improvement Four new varieties of soybean have been identified and released for cultivation. l Promising heterotic combinations reported in mustard for yield are HB 9912 × HB 9924 and PCR 15 × HB 9925. l Resistant donors identified in mustard for white rust and Alternaria blight tolerance. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 30 l Identified soybean JS 93-05, MAUS 61-2, MAUS 71 and RAUS 5 for different agroclimates. l At Ludhiana, soybean accessions PLSO 84 and UPSM 534 were found resistant to yellow mosaic virus. JS 93-05. It is an early-maturing variety with a duration of 90–95 days and yield potential of 2.0–2.5 tonnes/ha. The variety is recommended for Central Zone, comprising Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh. It is a semi-determinate variety with violet flowers, lanceolate leaves and 4-seeded pods. MAUS 61-2. This variety is also suitable for Central Zone, matures in 100–105 days, and has a yield potential of 2.0–3.0 tonnes/ha. The variety is semi-determinate with violet flowers, glabrous leaves, yellow seeds and light-brown hilum, and has moderate resistance to rust. MAUS 71.
