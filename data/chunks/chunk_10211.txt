 There may be considerable effects on land use due to snow melt, availability of irrigation, frequency and intensity of inter-and intra-seasonal droughts and floods, soil organic matter transformations, soil erosion, changes in pest profiles, decline in arable areas due to submergence of coastal lands and availability of energy, and on trade and overall economy. In order to meet the expanding needs of food, Natural Resource Management in Pre-independent India 71 agricultural products and clean drinking water, these resources should be conserved and further enhanced. Science-led management practices should be developed to produce more and more from less and less to ensure sustainable development. The ancient and eternal philosophy of ‘Living in harmony with nature’ and ‘Simple living and high thinking’ should be the central concepts of agricultural development. Indian scientists since ancient, medieval and British periods have made formidable contributions towards this cause, which formed the backbone of modern research and development in climate, water and soil research in the country and elsewhere.
