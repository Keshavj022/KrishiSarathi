SUMMARY Sustainable income and consistent employment can be achieved by the farming community by adopting IFS. The economic analysis of different components under IFS in hill farming system has shown considerably superior benefit : cost ratio. Economics of the IFS clearly shows that return was higher in livestock units in comparison to horticultural or agricultural crop. The IFS under study also demons- trated that it had created annual mandays of more than 1685 days. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: basunjana@gmail.com plants were used as vermicompost. Employment generation The economic analysis of the IFS shows that Mrs. Lepcha created more than 1685 mandays for the family which can be regarded as pretty good in the hill farming system. It is also seen that engagement in small scale IFS which Additionally, the harvested plants were used as vermicompost. Economics of turmeric crop Sowing of turmeric was done in March and harvested in December under IFS. The gross income was ` 17842 per acre which gave a net income of about ` 4002 having B:C ratio 1.29. Moreover, the harvested HANDBOOK OF To reverse the loss of environmental resources and also to reduce biodiversity loss, the Government of India has Integrated Pest Management (IPM) as part of the National Agricultural Policy. Integrated Pest Management emphasizes the growth of a health crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms. IPM is not new – mechanical, cultural and biological tactics were used by farmers for hundreds of years before chemical pesticides became available. Besides, there are IPM techniques that have been developed more recently and are effective in suppressing pests without adversely affecting the environment. The task of spreading the message of IPM across is tough due to poor awareness about the subject among people in line-departments as also among the farmers. The information on integrated pest management as a whole is scattered.
