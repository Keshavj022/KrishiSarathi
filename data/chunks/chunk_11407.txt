 Sandy to moderately heavy loam soils having neutral to saline reaction and medium fertility are the most suitable type for barley cultivation. Two to three ploughing with cultivator followed by planking after every ploughing to save the crop from Termite, Ants and other insect, seed treatment is advisable. 10 tonne FYM with 60 kg nitrogen and 30 kg phosphorus require for on ha. Half nitrogen and full dose of Phosphorous should be applied as basal and remaining half of the Nitrogen should be top dressed after first irrigation, while in case of light soils, one third of nitrogen and full dose of phosphorous as basal, one third of Nitrogen after first irrigation and rest after second irrigation. Optimum seed rate of 50 kg/ha for upland, 25 kg/ha for lowland and hilly region Sowing should be done in rows either by seed drill or behind the plough in furrows. Optimum depth of sowing is 4.0 to 5.0cm. Narendra Barley 1445. DWRB 92, Prakhar (K1055): (resistant to all three rusts, smut, and leaf blight diseases), K1149 (Geetanjali), K551 (Ritambhara) and K125 (Azad) recommended for alkaline/ saline soils. Seed treatment with Vitavax or Bavistin @ 2 gm per Kg seed. Generally, Barley crop require 2 to 3 irrigations for better yield. Depending upon the water availability, suitable stages for irrigation should be identified. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 140 Among the insect-pests, aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis) can be controlled by spraying Imidacloprid 200 SL, at 100 ml/ha in 200 - 250 litres of water per ha. Barley crop gets ready for harvest by the end of March to first fortnight of April. The average yield of rain fed crop ranges between 2,000 and 2,500 kg/ha, whereas that of irrigated crop is twice as much. Under favorable conditions grain yield of 5 - 6 tonnes/ha. Maize Maize may be sown any time from April to October, as the climate is warm even in the winter. Maize requires a well-drained sandy loam soil with organic matter. It thrives well in soil pH between 5.5 to 8.0. Buland variety maturity 178 days, tolerant to cold and average yield 31 q/acre, Partap-1 maturity 180 days, tolerant to cold, resistant to diseases and average yield 25 q/acre suitable for baby corn. PMH 9 variety maturity 180 days, cold tolerant, resistant to lodging, common rust and average yield of 32.5 q/ acre Seed is sowed in the middle of October to the middle of November. 4-5 deep ploughing provided an ideal condition for sowing of crop with compost 5 tons / ha and N2 100-120 Kg, P2O5 60 Kg and K2O 30-40 Kg. Urea should be applied in splits, mainly at sowing, knee- high and tasseling stages. Entire dose of P & K 2O with 40 Kg urea and 25 Kg of ZnSO4 at sowing recommended. Seed treatment with Bavistan@ 3gm/Kg of seeds, depth of sowing 4-6 cm with spacing 70cm x 25cm for row to row and plant to plant. 20-22 kg seed required for one hectare of land. Thinning should be done after 10 days of germination keeping one plant per hill.
