Impact on Household Income The household incomes of farmers before and after the interventions were compared (Table 19). Among the different components, maximum per cent increase in income was recorded in enterprises (419.12%) like mushroom, bee keeping, vermi-composting, value addition and processing. The net income from livestock increased from Rs 23,659 in 2016-17 to Rs 94,827 in 2020-21. Income from horticultural crops also increased more than three times during this period.
