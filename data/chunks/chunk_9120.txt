In 1965, we were supplementing our bread basket with imports; in 1995, we are ready for meaningful export of our agricultural produce generally. A proud achievement indeed! oft-quoted suc« "GREEN REVOLUTION" OF INDIA The “Grow More Food Campaign” of the early forties refused to Pay off. But the sublime imagination of Mr Lal Bahadur Shastri and Mrs Indira Gandhi, our late Prime Ministers, C. Subramanium and B. Sivaraman, outstanding bureaucrats, and late Dr B.P. Pal at first and later Dr M.S. Swaminathan, his successor at the ICAR, did prove the right mix of policy and research in boosting foodgrains production in the country. The introduction of improved varieties, for which we owe much to Dr Norman E. Borlaug, the steadfast application of ICAR scientists in the field and in the laboratory and above all the acceptance of the new varieties by the farmers and their toil helped India declare “Self-sufficiency” in foodgrains nearly two decades ago. The trend has only extended to other commodities ever since. For this Green Revolution, the ICAR has earned the King Baudouin International Development Prize in December 1988. GREEN REVOLUTION that began with the wheat and rice crops extended to other commodities as well. . .
