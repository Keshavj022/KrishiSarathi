Relative efficacy of alcoholic excretory waste treatments On overall basis, the toxicity of alcoholic excretory waste treatments was greater than of the nitrogenous excretory waste treatments, i.e. 40-81 (42.71%) in the former and 31-76 (27.70%) in the latter. In terms of different concentrations of alcoholic excretory waste treatments the order of toxicity was as follows: 100%>75%>50%>25%. The efficacy of treatments at different concentrations was 52.51% at 100%, 47.38% at 75%, 43.38% at 50% and 16.75% at 25%. Among alcoholic excretory waste treatments, the phenol showed 62.79 (79.10%) efficacy, followed by 2, 5-phenyl phenol with 43.61 (56.30%), catechol with 34.50 (32.10%) and by paracresol with 17.32 (8.85%) efficacy. On overall basis the order of toxicity was phenol>2,5 phenyl phenol> catechol>paracresol. Higher concentrations of all the treatments provided statistically (P<0.05) better control than their lower concentrations. The 100% and 50% concentrations of phenol were statistically at par in their efficacies. Statistically similar trend was found with 75% and 50% concentrations of catechol, 100% and 75% concentrations of 2, 5- diphenyl phenol and para-cresol. Statistically significant differences were found among all the treatments. Relative efficacy of nitrogenous excretory waste treatments Among nitrogenous excretory waste treatments, the toxicity was in the order: ammonia (51.05 or 60.50%) > urea (44.22 or 48.64%) > uric acid (9.00%). On overall basis, among nitrogenous excretory waste treatments the order of toxicity with different concentrations was: 38.07 (38.02%) with 100%, 32.89 (29.48%) with 75%, 31.92 (29.95%) with 50% and lastly 24.15 (16.75%) with 25%.
