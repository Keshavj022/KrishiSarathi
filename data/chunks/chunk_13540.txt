Agriculture 2024, 14, 103 8 of 15 In contrast, nitrogen deficiency in agricultural soils is a time-consuming problem, which has been combatted by applying chemical fertilizers. This is a costly practice, both economically and due to the environmental effects of excess reactive nitrogen on air, soil, and water quality. It also affects ecosystems and biodiversity, in addition to altering the balance of greenhouse gases [46]. Lentil cultivation helps fix N2 and reduces the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions [66]. This improves the mineral nitrogen content in the soil, which remains after lentil cultivation [67] because the roots can decompose in agricultural soil, thus serving as a source of nitrogen for subsequent generations of crops. Additionally, rotating legumes with non-legume crops is a natural method of fertilization [68]. This process improves the fertility of soil and aids its recovery. Damage caused to the soil and microbiome by applying fertilizers has been clearly established [69]. Weese et al. [70] evaluated two sites: one in which ammonium nitrate was used as a fertilizer for 22 years and an adjacent site in which no nitrogen fertilizers were applied. They observed that when inoculating the legumes Trifolium repens L., Trifolium hybridum L., and Trifolium pratense L. with sludge from fertilized soils, the biomass and chlorophyll contents of these plants were reduced compared to inoculation with samples from unfertilized soils. The results were similar when plants were inoculated with rhizobia isolated from fertilized soils; the plants had reduced biomass (17–30%), leaves (10–28%), stolons (8–21%), and chlorophyll (6–17%) compared to plants inoculated with bacteria isolated from unfertilized soils. Owing to the benefits that they bring to soil, lentils are commonly intercropped with other plants of agricultural interest (Figure 4). Figure 4. Intercropping of lentils. The cultivation of lentils with other plants of economic interest is a beneficial strategy in which non-nodule-forming plants obtain a greater amount of nitrogen, which is provided by the legume and is reflected in a higher production yield. The black arrows indicate an increase in the parameter mentioned. Intercropping refers to cultivating two or more crops simultaneously, without row arrangements, on the same land.
