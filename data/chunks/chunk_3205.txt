Crop Production Sesame • Application of S @ 45 kg/ha along with RDF was found to give maximum seed and oil yield and Single Super Phosphate was the best source of its application followed by Gypsum. • Intercropping combinations of sesame + blackgram (3:3), sesame + green gram (3:3), sesame + cotton (3:1), sesame + groundnut (2:2) and sesame + bajra (3: 1) were found to be most remunerative at different locations. • Two hand weedings at 15 and 30 days after sowing were most effective in controlling weeds and increasing seed yield. However, integration of Alachlor @ 1.5 a.i. kg/ha or Quizalofop ethyl @ 50 g a.i. Iha followed by one hand hoeing at 30 days after sowing was equally effective and economic. • The integrated nutrient supply and management with 50% N through urea + 50% N through oil cake or 50% N through urea + Azospirillum + Azotobactor + PSB + 50% P recorded the maximum seed yield. • Supply of recommended dose of nutrients through organic natural sources [FYM (3.75 tlha) + neem cake (900 kg/ha) + Ash (75 kg/ha) + Bone meal (75 kg/ha) + ELS 20 kg/ha + PSB @ 5 kg/ha (soil application) + Azotobacter @ 5 kg/ha + Trichoderma viride (0.04%) seed treatment + neem oil spray thrice at 15, 30 and 45 DAS, Azadrichitin (0.03%) at 30 DAS] resulted higher seed yield and recommended for organic cultivation of sesame. • Addition of micronutrients, zinc and iron @ 20 kg ZnS04 Iha + 25 kg FeS04 Iha and 2.5 tlha FYM + RDF resulted in higher seed yields of sesame. • One hand weeding at 15 DAS + soil stirring up to 50 DAS (After each effective rain) + seed soaking in thio‐urea (500 ppm) for 8 hrs was most effective in‐situ moisture conservation practice for increasing sesame yields under scare moisture conditions.
