2 On 21st September, 2020 the Government had announced the MSPs for all mandated Rabi crops for marketing season 2021-22. In view of nutritional requirements and changing dietary pattern and to achieve self- sufficiency in pulses and oilseeds production, the Government has fixed relatively higher MSP for these crops. The highest increase in MSP has been announced for lentil (Rs. 300 per quintal) followed by gram, rapeseed & mustard (Rs. 225 per quintal each) and safflower (Rs. 112 per quintal). For barley and wheat, an increase of Rs. 75 per quintal and Rs 50 per quintal respectively has been announced. The expected returns to farmers over their cost of production are estimated to be highest in case of wheat (106%) followed by rapeseed/ mustard (93%), gram and lentil (78%). For barley, return to farmers over their cost of production is estimated at 65% and for sunflower, it is 50%. Doubling of Farmers Income (DFI): 1.10 Government constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same. The Committee submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018 and thereafter, an Empowered Body was set up on 23.01.2019 to monitor and review the progress as per these recommendations. To achieve this, the Committee has identified seven sources of income growth viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non- farm occupations. 6 1.10.1 The efforts of the Government of India are to supplement the efforts of the State Governments through various schemes/ programmes and initiatives. These schemes/ programmes of the Government of India are meant for the welfare of farmers by increasing production, remunerative returns and augmentation of farmers’ income. The Government has adopted several developmental programmes, schemes, reforms and policies that focus on higher incomes for farmers. All these policies & programmes are being supported by higher budgetary allocations (from Rs. 52,655.00 crore during BE 2017-18 to Rs. 1,34,399.77 crore during BE 2020- 21), non-budgetary financial resources by way of creating Corpus Funds and supplementary income transfers under PM-KISAN. MSP is being fixed at a predetermined principle to keep it at the level of one and half times of the cost of production. Government has increased MSPs for all mandated Kharif, Rabi and other Commercial crops with a return of at least 50 % over all India weighted average cost of production for the season 2018-19 , 2019-20 and also recently for the 2020-21 season. 1.10.
