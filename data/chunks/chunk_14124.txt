 The parameters for the GC and MS are provided in Table S-5 and S-6. An internal standard of S-metolachlor-d11 was prepared at 300 µg.L−1 in ACN and injected with each sample to account for analytical bias. The detection of profenofos and quantification limits are provided in the Table S-3 and S-4. 2.4.3. Carbon CSIA of profenofos Carbon stable isotope signatures of profenofos were measured using a GC-C-IRMS system, consisting of a TRACE™ Ultra Gas Chromatograph (ThermoFisher Scientific) coupled via a GC IsoLink/Conflow IV inter­ face to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Delta V Plus, ThermoFisher Scientific). Chromatographic separation was performed on a TG-5MS column (60 m × 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 μm film thickness). Samples were injected in split/splitless modes depending on pesticide concentration, with an injection volume of 2 μL and injector temperature of 250 ◦C. A laboratory standard mix of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) was injected at the beginning of each session to verify the CO2 conversion and overall analytical performance of the instrument. The stable isotope compositions of pesticide standards were calibrated relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) scale with EA–IRMS (Flash EA IsoLink™ CN IRMS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a two-point calibration procedure with international reference materials AIEA600, USGS40, and USGS41. All isotopic measurements were reported in δ notation [36] relative to an international isotopic scale (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite): δ13C = ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ( 13C 12C ) sample ( 13C 12C ) VPDB −1 ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ × 1000 (1) EA-IRMS measurements for profenofos analytical standard yielded δ13C = − 22.6 ± 0.2 ‰ (n = 3). To ensure measurement accuracy, standards with isotopic compositions characterized by EA-IRMS were injected every six samples. The long-term reproducibility of profenofos GC-IRMS measurements was δ13C = −23.1 ± 0.5 ‰ (n = 23) across all analytical sessions. Samples were measured three times, and the δ¹³C values were reported as the arithmetic mean, accompanied by the standard deviation (SD) calculated from the replicate measurements. Isotope fractionation values (εC) relating the change in δ13C to the extent of degradation, were derived from the logarithmic form of the Rayleigh equation, without forcing the regression through the origin [37]: ln (δ13Ct + 1000 δ13C0 + 1000 ) = εC 1000 ln (ct c0 ) (2) Fig. 1.

Journal of Hazardous Materials 488 (2025) 137428 4 where δ13C0 and δ13Ct represent the carbon isotope ratios for profenofos (expressed in ‰) at time 0 and t of degradation, respectively, and ct/c0 is the fraction of remaining profenofos at time t. The isotope fractionation values (εC), obtained from the microcosm degradation experiments, were used in a modified form of the Rayleigh equation (Eq.
