 Attains maturity in the second year of its life, when 25-30 cm in total length.  Broodstock is raised in pond along with other carps in captive conditions for breeding. Brooders of size 35-50 cm are selected for induced breeding in a sex-ratio of 1:2 female to male.  Brooders are given hormone injection of Ovatide/Gonopro FH @ 1.0 ml/kg body weight to female and 0.5 ml/kg to male and kept in breeding tank/hapa for spawning.  Spawning occurs 6-8 h after the injection and lays 7.5-8.0 lakh eggs/kg body weight with average fertilization of 70%.  The eggs are transferred to the hatching pool and are kept under mild water circulation for hatching, which takes about 14-16 h. The hatchlings are further kept in similar condition in hatching tank for further two more days before transferring for nursery rearing.  The spawn is reared further in cement tanks for raising fry.  The seed production technology was developed in Uttarakhand for hill states.

Basheer More information: Director, ICAR-National Bureau of Fish Genetic Resources, Lucknow Email: director.nbfgr@icar.gov.in Malabar Labeo Labeo dussumieri (Valenciennes, 1842)  Malabar Labeo, a popular endemic carp species of Western Ghats, is distributed up to north Canara in India and also probably in Sri Lanka. Categorized as endangered fish.  Mature females have bulged abdomen and eggs ooze out from vent on pressing the abdomen. Mature males have a rough surface of pectoral fins and ooze milky-milt on pressing the belly.  Induced bred in captive conditions during monsoon. Fully mature brooders in sex ratio of 1:2 female to male is kept in the spawning tank of circular carp hatchery for breeding.  Females are induced bred with pituitary extract of two doses @ 2-3 and 4-6 mg/kg body weight or a single dose of commercial hormone @ 0.3 ml/kg, whereas single injection of 2-3 mg of pituitary extract/kg or 0.2 ml commercial hormone/kg body weight is given to males.  Spawning occurs in 9-10 h. Fertilized eggs are spherical, translucent, demersal and non- adhesive with diameter 4.0 to 4.5 mm.  The fertilized eggs hatch within 10-12 h with hatching rates of 80-95% in the hatching tank and grow to spawn size within 2-days.  The spawn is further reared in tanks to raise to fry.  The seed production is practiced mainly in the state of Kerala. 8 Bata Labeo bata (Hamilton, 1822)  Bata is acclaimed as a very important and tasty minor carp, particularly in eastern and north- eastern parts of the country. Distributed in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.  Suitable for inclusion in carp polyculture system, the species is now considered important for diversification.  Brooders are raised in ponds along with other carps, where they mature within a year.
