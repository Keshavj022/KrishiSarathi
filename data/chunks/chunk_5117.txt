 Animals in the state of dehydration are prone to hyperthermia, because heat loss by evaporation of tissue fluids is reduced (Kelly, 1984; Radostits et al. 1994). All the sick animals had mild degree of dehydration due to anorexia and hyperthermia, which might have resulted due to reduction of heat loss by evaporation. The mean body temperature of animals in Group II reached normal levels after treatment, perhaps due to control of bacterial infection and correction of dehydration, as the sick animals started consuming drinking water much earlier than the animal in Group I.  VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Interpretation Complete blood count Regarding haemogram, Rosenberger (1979) reported the normal values of haemoglobin (Hb) packed cell volume (PCV) and total erythrocyte count (TLC) were 10 (8-12) g/dl, 36 (30-40)% and 7 (5-8) million/ml. The mean values of haemoglobin (11.18 ± 0.04 g/dl), packed cell volume (35.23± 0.20%) and total erythrocyte count (6.01 ± 0.04 million/ml) of apparently healthy cattle observed in this study were within the normal range (Rosenberger, 1979). The pre-treatment mean values of haemoglobin, packed cell volume and total erythrocyte count in sick animals of treatment Groups I and II are presented in Table 2. Their mean values in sick animal group showed significant elevation when compared with that in normal animals. This is apparently due to haemoconcentration, which is always associated with dehydration (Benjamin, 1985). In the present study, the increase in haemoglobin content, packed cell volume and total erythrocyte count might be due to reduction of blood plasma volume and haemoconcentration. The post-treatment mean values of haemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV) and total erythrocyte count (TEC) reached the normal level (Table 2). But their values were found to be marginally higher than the normal values of apparently healthy cattle. This could be attributed to the normal physiological variation between individual animals before the onset of foot-and- mouth disease. Probably these sick animals had higher haemoglobin, packed cell volume and total erythrocyte count before the onset of the disease, and the treatment adopted have restored it to its original normal values. Fig. 2 leucogram, Rosenberger (1979) reported that the total leucocyte count of the cattle ranged between 5,000 and 10,000 (7,500)/ml. The mean value of total leucocyte count in apparently healthy cattle was 5,350.00 ± 38.88/mm3 and it was within the normal range as stated by Rosenberger (1979). The pre-treatment mean values of total leucocyte count of sick animals in treatment Groups I and II were 8,870.00 ± 66.12 and 8,820.00 ± 160.99/ml (Table 3). These values of sick animals significantly increased when compared to that of apparently healthy cattle. The leucocytosis observed in the present study might have occurred due to normal reaction of body defence mechanism against infection (Doxy, 1983).
