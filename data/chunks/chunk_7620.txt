 National level Cluster Frontline Demonstrations (CFLDs) on Pulses (75,139 demonstrations) were conducted to demonstrate the production potential of new pulses varieties and the related technologies. In kharif 14,300 ha, in rabi 17,832 ha and in summer 4,712 ha area were covered under CFLDs on pulses, which resulted in an increase in yield over national average yield, state average yield and local check. Likewise, 50,669 CFLDs were conducted on oilseed crops. At national level, the yield advantage in oilseed crops over the farmersâ€™ practices was recorded highest in linseed (34.60%) due to suitable technology interventions and skilling of farmers.
