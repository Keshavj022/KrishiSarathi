To increase crop productivity, quality and judicious use of inputs such as water, seeds, fertilizer and pesticides need to be improved with efficient use of modern technology and diversification of enterprises. To increase income of farmers, a range of strategies (Economic, Technological, Infrastructural/ Information, Political/Policy and Social) need to be adopted to transform the current production-driven cropping system to income-driven farming system and reduce the disparity among farmers of different regions of India. Agricultural research should be re-oriented with farmers’ participatory approach to unshackle the vicious circle of poverty and drudgery and fulfill the aspirations of resource-poor, smallholder farmers. The state should enhance its investments on agricultural research and development to achieve the target of doubling farmers’ income and address the growing challenges of resource degradation, escalating input crisis and costs with overarching effects of climate change. An agro-climatic zone-specific action plan has been developed to address the constraints of increasing farmers’ income. Attempt has been made to identify improved practices, their potential and constraints for increasing farmers’ income in different agro-climatic zones of Odisha.
