 −ΔG◦(The free energy of K+ exchange) The standard free energy of K exchange was calculated as described byWoodruff (1955) as ΔG◦ = −2.303 RT log ARe 0K; where, R and T are molar gas constant (1.98 cal mol−1) and temperature (298 K), respectively. 2.4. Statistical analysis The available K data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS window version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Treatment means were separated by least significant difference (LSD) test at 5% level of significance (p = 0.05). Least squares regression equations, based on linear model (ΔK =α1 +α2CRe K) were used to describe the Q/I relationships between ΔK and CRe K (Wang et al., 1988). A Pearson’s correlation matrix was constructed among the Q/I parameters and 1 N NH4OAC-K+. 3. Results 3.1. Available potassium in soil The effect of different management practices was clearly observed in the available K status in soil (Fig. 2). Available K ranged from 86 to 145 mg kg−1, highest and lowest was associated with Sc6 (145 mg kg−1) and Sc1 (86 mg kg−1), respectively. Scenario 2 (42%), Sc3 (6%), Sc4 (47%), Sc5 (26%) and Sc6 (69%) showed higher available K over Sc1. The increase in soil available K in all the treatments (expect Sc3 and Sc5) were significant as compared to Sc1 and were able to maintain available K status in the medium to high range whereas farmers practice (Sc1) had low status of available K. Between the two cropping systems, on an average maize- wheat-mungbean cropping system was able to maintain higher available K (36%) as compared to rice-wheat-mungbean system. No significant difference was observed in terms of methods of irrigation. Both SDI and flooding method performed at par with each other with respect to available K. The average of available K in full CA based sce­ narios (Sc3, Sc4, Sc5 and Sc6) was found to be 36% higher over Sc1. The result shows that conservation tillage and incorporation/retention of crop residues was able to increase the available K as compared Sc1. Fig. 2. Available K (mg kg−1) of soil after wheat harvest 2020 (0–15 cm) under different scenarios. Sc1- conventional rice-wheat system, Sc2- partial CA-based rice-wheat-mungbean system, Sc3- CA-based rice-wheat-mungbean system, Sc4- CA-based maize-wheat-mungbean system, Sc5- CA-based rice-wheat- mungbean system + SDI system, Sc6- CA-based maize-wheat-mungbean + SDI system. Values differ significantly at P = 0.05 when not followed by the same small letter (s) according to Duncan Multiple Range Test for separation of mean. Error bars represent standard error of mean (n = 3). K. Rani et al. Soil & Tillage Research 228 (2023) 105644 5 Available K data by routine method exhibits a general impression of K availability. However, in order to understand other aspects of K supply such as equilibrium activity ratio, buffering capacity, K potential etc. it was important to study the changes in K parameters as determined by Q/ I curve. 3.2.
