 Kinnow Fruiting season of Kinnow crop is very long (approx. 10 months), and guava bears two crops (winter, rainy season in northern India) in a year. Nutrients should be applied to fruit crops to replenish the removal of nutrients by excessive crop load from the soil. Better irrigation technologies, such as micro-irrigation are required to decrease the ‘water footprint’ and enhance ‘water productivity’ owing to a decrease in the availability of fresh water for horticultural crops. To optimize the utilization of water and fertilizers, Punjab Agricultural University has standardized the monthly water requirements of Kinnow crop based on the age of the tree planted at 6 × 6 m spacing through drip system. The recommended irrigation and fertigation schedule for Severe water scarcity is noted in S-W districts of Punjab because of the Bandi of the canals from March to May. Hence, Kinnow trees can January–February 2024 23 occasionally be irrigated by mixing saline and freshwater (about EC of 2 mmhos/cm), exclusively through drip irrigation. Excessive irrigation in citrus orchards causes serious fungal diseases such as Phytophthora, foot, and root rot. Kinnow plants should not be subjected to water stress during February (before sprouting) and from April to June (after fruit set); otherwise, the intensity of flowers and fruit drop will be enhanced.

About 15 fertilizer split doses are applied from February to April followed by 12 split doses from July to mid- September. Whereas, the recommended dose of FYM should be applied in December-January every year. The plants require only N fertilizer during pre-bearing stages; however, inorganic P2O5 and K2O fertilizers should be applied during post-bearing stages via drip irrigation for quality fruit production. The dose of nutrients should be stabilized following the plant attains maturity after 8 years of plantation.
