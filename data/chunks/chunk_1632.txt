 About 200 F1 seeds for various cross combinations were harvested and grown. Hybridity testing confirmed 90 true F1 plants. Sustainable management tools for Fall Armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E.Smith) in maize: The maize genotypes viz., CML 44 BBB (3.0), DML 163-1 (3.5), and IML 16-248 (4.0) were found promising based on leaf damage rating (1-9) scale for foliar resistance to FAW artificial infestation. The expression study of lipoxygenase and BXs pathway genes and correlation analysis of jasmonate and BXs metabolites indicated that induction of toxic BXs accumulation in resistant genotypes depends on JA signalling pathway. Higher content of threonine (Thr) and arginine (Arg) were found in BML 6 (susceptible line) and was lower in resistant lines (DMRE 63, CML 71). Five geographical populations of FAW were assessed for molecular diversity using Tpi marker to resolve the ambiguity in mtCOI- based strain identification. All were identified as corn strains based on nucleotide variations at positions 168, 180, and 183 of the Tpi exon, where a few individuals also had Corn-Rice inter-strain signatures at certain positions. Also, more than 90% of the FAW population in India is corn strain according to sequenced data and NCBI data. Exploiting alien genetic resources for developing climate resilient wheat and understanding mechanism of heat tolerance: The germplasm comprising of 400 accessions including wild relatives and progenitors of wheat phenotyped for heat stress tolerance was genotyped using 35K Axiom SNP chip to identify the novel genes/QTLs. Under late sown conditions, the major SNPs for SPAD and CFL were found on 2A, 3A, 11 SNPs for GFD on 3A and 2B, and 5 SNPs for TGW on 2B, 3A, 5D, 6B and 7B and under timely sown conditions Morphological observation of collected U. virens isolates. NASF -Gvt-12 NASF -Gvt-1 NASF -Gvt-2 NASF -Gvt-3 NASF -Gvt-4 NASF -Gvt-5 NASF -Gvt-6 NASF -Gvt-7 NASF -Gvt-8 NASF -Gvt-9 NASF -Gvt-10 NASF -Gvt-11 NASF -Gvt-13 NASF -Gvt-14 NASF -Gvt-15 Glimpses of National Agricultural Science Fund (2006-2023) 22 major SNPs for SPAD and CFL were identified on 2B and 7A, for GFD on 1D and 2A, 24 SNPs for TGW on 1B, 5A and 5B. Using a set of 310 T. durum / Ae. speltoides BILs phenotyped for heat stress tolerance and genotyped by sequencing, 50 QTLs were detected on all the chromosomes except 7B. Consistent QTLs were detected for various heat tolerance traits under OE and HE across the years. Under HE, seven QTLs QSn. pau-Td-HE-2B, QSn.pau-Td-HE-7A, QPl.pau-As- HE-3B, QGw.pau-Gw-Td-HE-1B, QGps.pau-Td- HE-2B, QGfd.pau-Td-HE-2A.2 and QDtm.pau- As-HE-6A were detected. The QTL for SL QSL. pau-DS-OE-HE-5A on chromosome 5A was detected under both OE and HE. For HTI of the phenotypic traits six QTLs QHti-Sn.pau-Td-7A, QHti-Sl.pau-As-5A, QHti-Pl.pau-As-2A, QHti-Gfd. pau-As-1B, QHti-Gfd.pau-As-6A and QHti-Dtm. pau-As-1B were mapped that were found to be stable across the years.
