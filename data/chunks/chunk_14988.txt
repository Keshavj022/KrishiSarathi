 Further perusal of Table 7 reveals that women with good knowledge of the quality of seed need to come to the group of males for their de­ cision to be considered for the procurement of seed during farming and even if their experience is not good enough to take the decision on the collection of seeds (the RRR are 0.276 and 0.243, respectively). 5. Conclusion and Policy Implication The result of the study reveals that the agrarian society (especially the forward caste and other backward caste communities) of Odisha is subject to male dominance when it comes to making decisions regarding agricultural activities. It is found that both sole and joint ownership of land by both men and women in farm activities raise the agrarian decision-making power of the females. However, experience in overall agrarian activities is negatively related to the females’ overall agricul­ tural decision. The information on overall agricultural activities is also inversely related to the overall agricultural decision to be taken by the women. That means even if the female has sufficient information on agricultural activities, she needs to be a Male for her voice hardly heard. Likewise, the decision on agricultural expenditure and timing of agri­ cultural activities are negatively associated with the experience and information of women in overall agrarian activities. Additionally, even though women have good knowledge of the quality of seeds, they need the help of the male for their decision to be considered for the pro­ curement of seed during farming.
