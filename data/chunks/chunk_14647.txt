, 2018); however, for actinomycetes, this threshold is raised to 99 % based on comparative studies between 16S rRNA gene sequences (Guo et al., 2015). As a result, we used a 99–100 % threshold to assign actinomycetes isolates to distinct clusters. Since more than 30 % of the isolates obtained in the study belonged to Nocordiopsis we have taken those isolates too in further analysis. Like Streptomyces spp. members of the genus Nocardiopsis too can Fig. 3.

In the current study, 45 isolates were assigned to Streptomyces spp., and 20 isolates to Nocardiopsis spp. based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Streptomyces spp. is reported to have advanced adaptability to exist in different extreme environments and habitant of diverse condi- tions like frozen soils, deserts, and oceans (Okoro et al., 2009; Passari et al., 2018). The ﬁndings of this study have shown that there is a high level of diversity within Streptomyces spp. present in the agriculture ﬁelds of Tamil Nadu. The isolates collected from different crop rhizosphere and bulk soils of agriculture ﬁelds fell under 18 species forming three clades. A similar study on the diversity of streptomycetes in prairie soils resulted in 34 different OTUs, albeit the 16S rRNA gene sequence used for diversity analy- Table 2 Identities of actinomycetes isolated in this study, NCBI accession numbers of 16S rRNA gene sequence and NAIMCC accessions numbers.
