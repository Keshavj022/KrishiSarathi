Experiment On-farm trials were laid out in the riverbeds of the Ganges near Garh Mukteshwar. It was observed that cultivation of cucurbits was practised as reported by the disclosure, though with some variations. The observations recorded for germination and plant growth indicated that cucurbits performed well in riverbed system. Comparative study of cultivation of cucurbits in different conditions of riverbed (river bank, mid- course) and low-land adjoining the river was offset as inundation of river washed away the Experiment The technical parameters considered for observations: (i)land and seed bed preparation, (ii) seed rate, (iii) method of sowing, (iv) irrigation, nutrients and plant protection management, (v) mulching, (vi) efficacy, (vii) rationality and perception (farmers and scientist); and the economic parameters were yield and cost benefit analysis.

Economics of the riverbed cultivation revealed that farmers earned profits Rs 50,000 to 60,000 in watermelon, bottle gourd and pumpkin, and Rs 17,000 in muskmelon (Table2). The trials need to be replicated on larger scale for proper understanding of the cultivation system.
