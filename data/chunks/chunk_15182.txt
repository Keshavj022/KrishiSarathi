 A subsample of the archaeobotanical assemblages from all three sites was obtained for stable isotope analysis (refer to Table 1 for de­ tails). We also sampled 43 cow/buffalo bone fragments for analysis, but due to extremely poor collagen preservation all the samples failed. 4.1.2. South Deccan: Sanganakallu Kupgal Several South Deccan sites have been radiocarbon dated, and on the basis of these dates a timeline has been posited (e.g. Fuller et al., 2007; Fuller and Murphy, 2014; Kingwell-Banham et al., 2015; Boivin et al., 2018). The earliest sites from the Southern Neolithic date to c. 3000 BCE and this is termed Southern Neolithic Phase 1a. This is followed by the emergence of the ashmounds and management and herding of cattle and caprines at around 2500 BCE. This is termed the Southern Neolithic Phase 1b. It is only by about 2200 BCE, i.e. Southern Neolithic Phase 2, when village sites such as Sanganakallu-Kupgal appear across the hill­ tops of the southern peninsula, in proximity to ashmounds, that we see evidence of crop cultivation. In Southern Neolithic Phase 3, which starts at c. 1800 BCE, ashmounds are abandoned, though some hill-top village sites continue to be occupied up to the Megalithic period (c. 1400-1200 BCE). The archaeobotanical remains suggest subsistence based on cultivated millets, pulses, wheat, and barley (Fuller et al., 2004). While there is demographic continuity in the region around the Tungabhadra and Krishna river basins during the transition from Neolithic Phase 3 to the Megalithic period, south of this region in Sanganakallu-Kupgal there is an intensification of settlement and subsistence on the hill-top villages followed by an almost complete abandonment. This has been hypoth­ esised to be due to an increase in aridity (Roberts et al., 2016). Here we consider the contexts spanning this transition, approximately 1750–1000 BC. 4.1.3. North Deccan: Paithan The second site in the Deccan, Paithan, is located in the northwestern part of the plateau and dates from the Early Historic period to the early Medieval period (c. 300 BCE to 7th century AD). It is roughly 500 km northwest of Sanganakallu-Kupgal (Fig. 1), but nevertheless lies in the same semi-arid geographical region. The extraordinarily rich assem­ blage of archaeobotanical remains demonstrate the persistence of the Southern Neolithic millet (Fuller et al., 2004; Fuller, 2013), as well as a diversified diet based on rice, wheat, barley, winter pulses, horsegram, and African millets (sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet) (Fuller, 2013). The archaeobotanical analysis by Fuller (2013) suggests that millets were the staple crops, and rice was likely a high-status food. Addition­ ally, there appears to have been successive agricultural diversification and intensification (increasing repeated cropping on the same lands, as well as reducing the fallow season between cropping) through time (Fuller, 2013). 4.2.
