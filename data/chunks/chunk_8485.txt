 Fingermillet and pigeonpea intercropping at 8: 2 ratio not only augmented farm income but also increased supply of legumes Whole ragi after decortication Fingermillet is mainly used in the form of flour. A unique process for decorticating whole-grain after partly separating outer brown-coloured bran-layer has been developed. This has opened up novel ways of using whole-grain in preparing conventional and special foods for diabetic and obese population. VALUE-ADDITION OF FINGERMILLET DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 26 l Grain-amaranth Suvarna intercropped in long-duration pigeonpea CO 6 resulted in higher land-equivalent ratio, gross returns and benefit: cost ratio. l In Jatropha, closer spacing (1 m × 1 m) recorded higher seed yield at lower fertilizer doses, and 2 m × 1 m spacing at higher doses. l Berseem HB I released for Haryana. l Added 450 indigenous and 3 exotic germplasms to forage crops. l Azospirillum inoculation to sorghum increased green fodder yield to 19.3% and dry matter yield to 27.1%. l In silvopasture system, trees contri- buted to 48% in dry matter yield in large holdings, followed by 37% in small and 35% in medium holdings. l In hortipastoral system, pasture production was higher with aonla, followed by ber and bael. UNDERUTILIZED CROPS Crop Improvement IC 35407 of grain-amaranth, Sangla B 1 of buckwheat, PRR 9402 and LRB 122 of ricebean, H 656 of Job’s tear and Local check of faba-bean are found to be the highest seed yielders. In observation row trials, entries H 2216 (0.46 tonne/ha) of perilla, SMLAB 1 (1.48 tonnes/ha) of adzuki-bean and PRC 9801-1 (1.33 tonnes/ ha) of chenopodium have showed promise. Protein content of grain-amaranth ranged from 11.4 to 13.8% (SKNA 20), and the oil content was observed high in RMA 2 (12.8%), RGA 62-10-1 (12.2%) and RGA 92-6-2 (12.14%). Entry AG 114 of grain-amarnath was observed rich in oleic acid (34.3%) and Rasna 2 in linoleic acid (29.4%). Among fifteen genotypes of kalingada, protein content ranged from 27.5 to 31.8% (SKNK 158), and oil content from 30.6 to 36.4% (SKNK 16). In faba-bean, protein content in mature seeds ranged from 22.3 to 26.2% (BSH 42) and vicine-convicine content ranged from 0.76% (HB 193) to 1.3%. Crop Production Intercropping grain-amaranth (Suvarna) in long-duration pigeonpea (CO 6) resulted in higher land-equivalent ratio (1.26), gross returns (Rs 27,542/ha) and benefit : cost ratio (1.52). Application of Alachlor at 1.5 kg a.i./ha resulted in highest grain yield and least production of weed biomass in both common and tartary buckwheats. In Jatropha, closer spacing (1 m × 1 m) recorded higher seed yield at lower doses of fertilizer, and wider spacing (2 m × 1 m) in the highest seed yield at high doses of fertilizer. FORAGE CROPS Crop Improvement A new variety of berseem HB I has been released for Haryana. Total of 450 new indigenous and 3 exotic germplasms of different forage crops have been added to the collection.
