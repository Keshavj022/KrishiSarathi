 Such an access point (or hotspot) has a range of about 20 meters indoors and a greater range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometers achieved by using multiple overlapping access points. Various IEEE 802.11 standards are mentioned in table below- Table 4: Various IEEE 802.11 Standards IEEE Standard Frequency Bands Max Speed 802.11a 5 GHz 54 Mbit/s 802.11b 2.4 GHz 11 Mbit/s 802.11g 2.4 GHz 54 Mbit/s Shttps://www.sigfox.com/ TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 18 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 19 802.11n 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz 600 Mbit/s 802.11ac 5 GHz 3.5 Gbit/s Wi-Fi is an important communication protocol pertaining to M2M communication as in several scenarios Wi-Fi hotspots are potentially the gateways for most sensor nodes. Wi-Fi 6 Wi-Fi 6, or IEEE 802.11ax, stands as the latest evolution in wireless technology, surpassing Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac). This advanced standard introduces significant enhancements to wireless connectivity, delivering higher data rates through use of wider channels, advanced modulation techniques, and overall efficiency improvements. Operating in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands, Wi-Fi 6 ensures backward compatibility while providing a migration path for devices from 802.11n and 802.11ac. IEEE802.11ax focuses on better efficiency, capacity and performance as compared to previous technologies of Wi-Fi family, thus providing 4x improvements in average throughput per user and better user experience even for dense indoor/outdoor deployments such as airports, railway stations, shopping malls, stadiums, homes, school campuses. Key features include Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), dividing a channel into smaller sections to enable simultaneous communication with multiple devices, enhancing efficiency and reducing latency. Several nations around the globe are making 6 GHz band available for unlicensed use. Wi-Fi 6E extends Wi-Fi 6 to the 6 GHz band. Wi-Fi 6 operation in the 6 GHz frequency band enables Wi- Fi to continue delivering positive experiences for the most bandwidth-intensive applications. Wi-Fi HaLow Wi-Fi HaLow, also known as 802.11ah, is a wireless communication standard developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance to address the specific requirements of the Internet of Things (IoT). Wi-Fi HaLow operates in the sub-1 GHz frequency band, providing longer range, lower power consumption, and better penetration through walls and other obstacles compared to traditional Wi-Fi standards. Wi-Fi HaLow achieves an extended range due to its operation in lower frequency bands, providing reliable connectivity over greater distances. Wi-Fi HaLow supports the Internet of Things (IoT) use cases in industrial, agricultural, smart building, smart homes, and digital health care and smart city environments.
