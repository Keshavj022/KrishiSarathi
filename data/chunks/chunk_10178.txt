 Research was undertaken to overcome these limitations and breeding programmes successfully brought out wheat varieties like Pusa-4, which had a good plant stand in spite of rain and wind. It was of shorter duration, and used to be sown in first week of November and harvested in early March. Pusa-12 was the first wheat variety released through hybridization breeding in 1910, while Pusa-4 was adjudged as the ‘best quality wheat’ in 1911. Dr. Benjamin Peary Pal commenced the rust resistance breeding programme in wheat at Tutikandi, Shimla and Pusa Bihar. The Pusa wheat varieties varied considerably in their degree of resistance to rust diseases. The most resistant wheat varieties were Pusa-52 and Pusa-4, while the most susceptible cultivars were Pusa-12 and Pusa 80-5. Pusa-111 was fixed from a natural cross in Pusa-4, but was more resistant to rust than Pusa-4. Breeding programmes of oat and barley were also undertaken for developing high yielding and early maturing varieties. Selections in oats viz., 12-1 and 19-1 were found very promising and termed as BS Type 1 and BS Type 2, respectively. Barley constituted one of the main cereal crops of Northern India and a number of pure line strains were isolated. B-4 became the highest yielding cultivar during the time. Tobacco research was also undertaken during colonial period. Tobacco variety Type 28 (Pusa-28) became very popular among Indian states during 1916-1920 with about 12,000 acres of cultivation each year. The area under tobacco was suddenly increased by manifold with about 50,000 acres under cultivation in 1921. Successful trials of Type 28 variety of tobacco were also made Indian Agriculture after Independence 38 by Indian Leaf Tobacco Development Company in Bihar. The company also undertook trials of Pusa-28 in British East Africa, Kenya and Zanzibar. Considerable progress was made in the isolation and study of linseed crop as well. The study of inheritance of various characters in linseed was undertaken. Type 124 of linseed gave higher yield compared to Type 12 and Type 121. Commercial possibilities of safflower oil were also explored. Gram was another important crop in which breeding programmes successfully brought out promising genotypes named Pusa-17 and Pusa-18, which gave higher yields compared to the local genotypes. IARI (now Indian Agricultural Research Institute) at Pusa, Bihar was later shifted to New Delhi in 1936. Sugarcane breeding in colonial India continued to give promising varieties. A new sugarcane variety, Co 290 released from Coimbatore in 1924, superior to Co 213, had proved suitable for all sugarcane growing areas. It was reported that in 1926-27, the area under Coimbatore canes in North India was estimated at 23,600 acres and the increased profit to cane growers placed at Rs. 14,50,000. In 1927-28, the area increased to one lakh acres with more than proportional increase in profits.
