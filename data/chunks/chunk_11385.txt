 Recommended Seed rate and sowing: 10-12 kg seed/ha for irrigated and 12-15 Kg/ha for rainfed/partially irrigated conditions. Suitable sowing time is ranges from 15th October to 15th November, it should be done on or before 15th November. Row to row distance: 30-45 cm in line sowing Seed treatment: Advised to Seed treatment with Trichoderma viridae @ 10 g/kg seed or carbendazim 2g/kg seed for the management of fungal diseases, also advised to seed treatment with Imidacloprid 70 WP @ 7.5g/kg seed to manage the sucking insects like aphids, thrips etc. Irrigation management: Light irrigation should be applied just after sowing and second irrigation apply after 7-10 days of first, subsequently irrigations should be applied at 15-25 days’ interval. 4-6 irrigation in light soils and 3-4 irrigations in heavy soils are sufficient to achieve good production of this crop. interculture operations: Two interculture (hoeing and weeding) operations required; first interculture at 30-35 DAS and 60-65 DAS. Plant protection measures: Growing castor or marigold as a trap crop for the management of Spodoptera. Plant tall border crops like maize, sorghum for the management of mites, aphid and thrips. Crop rotation of non-host crops like cereal crops for 3 years must be followed. Aphid and thrips: Installation of yellow and blue sticky traps ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 98 @ 10-12 trap/ha each followed by foliar spray with neem oil 3000 ppm @4ml/lit. water or NSKE 5% or Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 0.3ml/lit. or acephate 75 SP @ 1.5 ml/lit. water Seed midge: foliar spray with neem oil 3000 ppm @4ml/lit. water or NSKE 5% or methyl-O-demeton 25 EC @ 1ml/lit. water Powdery mildew: Dusting with Sulphur dust @ 20-25 kg/ha in morning hours is recommended followed by foliar spray with Kerathan (Dinocap) @ 1ml/lit. water at 10-15 days’ interval, harvesting of the mature crop should not be delayed avoiding powdery mildew attack. Blight: cloudy weather and high humidity at flowering stage is favourable for this disease, advised to foliar spray with fungicide propiconazole or hexaconazole 5% SC @ 1ml/lit. water at 15 days’ interval. Wilt: Follow seed treatment and soil treatment with Trichoderma or Bavstin before sowing as suggested above Stem gall disease: Use stem gall resistant variety Ajmer coriander-1 in affected areas, use of healthy seeds for sowing and seed treatment with carbendazim (Bavstin) @ 2g/kg seed and foliar spray with carbendazim @ 1g/lit. or hexaconazole 5 SC @ 1ml/lit. water Frost management: this crop is very sensitive to frost, during the chances of frosting apply light irrigation and foliar spray with sulfuric acid 0.1% at midnight to escape crop form the frost. Storage: Moisture level of seeds should be maintained below 8.5-9 per cent for long period storage. Fennel Cool and dry weather is favourable for this crop and optimum temperature for germination (20-29o Celsius) and for growth (15- 20 o Celsius) is required.
