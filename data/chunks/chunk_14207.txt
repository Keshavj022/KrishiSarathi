 On the other hand, extreme, severe and moderate droughts occurred only for 10 % of the total study period with DARs as 85 %, 100 %, 87 % and 89 % for extreme; 89 %, 94 %, 88 % and 79 % for severe; and 63 %, 68 %, 72 % and 60 % for moderate as reflected by SSMI, ESSMI SPI and SPEI respectively. The ESSMI’s inefficiency in identifying extreme droughts is particularly evident again. In parallel, from the table it is observed that 100 % of the extreme droughts (DAR = 0.17 from Fig. 12) as identified by the ESSMI falls within the 10 % of total time. These overall results suggest that near normal to moderate droughts are the most common levels of drought in the study area from 1991 to 2020. 4.4. Drought impacts relation with land cover and soil types The relationship between land cover classes and drought conditions provides critical insights into how different land cover classes respond to drought impacts. The Fig. 13 illustrates the most affected land cover classes (rangelands, forests, built-up areas, waterbodies, and croplands) by drought in SPH for the years 2015 to 2020, as measured by SSMI, ESSMI, SPI and SPEI. The years 2015 to 2020 are selected for analysis because the SPH region experienced a wide range of drought conditions ranging from less than 20 % drought affected area to more than 70 % drought affected area during this period (Table 2). The high resolution land cover for SPH used in this analysis is obtained from ‘Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) Land Cover (https://livingatlas.arcgi s.com/landcover/). Detailed descriptions of the ESRI land cover are Fig. 12. The percentages of DAR reflected by SSMI, ESSMI, SPI and SPEI for near normal and mild drought, moderate drought, severe drought and extreme droughts in SPH from 1991 to 2020. H. Palagiri and M.

Over the period from 2015 to 2020, croplands have consistently been the most affected by drought followed by rangelands, forests, built-up areas and waterbodies. (Fig. 13). Rangelands were second most affected in 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2020, whereas forests took this po- sition in 2017 and 2019. This fluctuation could be linked to changes in weather patterns, land use management practices, and ecological dy- namics. For example, rangelands may suffer more in years with pro- longed drought due to their reliance on seasonal rainfall for natural grazing, while forests might be more vulnerable in years when water tables drop significantly, affecting deep-rooted trees. Regardless of the index used (SSMI, ESSMI, SPI, and SPEI), the ranking of the most affected land cover types remains consistent (Fig. 13). This order holds true irrespective of the total drought affected area in a year, whether less than 20 % or more than 70 % (Table 2).
