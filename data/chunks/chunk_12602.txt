 In Nagaland, the trend shows that the stocking rate of all species is declining mainly because of increased management costs, lack of quality breeds, lack of feed resources, increased risks due to disease and lack of market stimulus. Pig development under livestock sector has tremendous scope, but is still largely unorganized. The per capita consumption of pork in Nagaland is the highest in the country. It is also the largest importer of pigs in the country both for meat and breeding purposes. Scaling up and intensification of pig production is required to reduce the large deficit of slaughter pigs. There is a need to shift from the current small scale household to semi commercial production system (NABARD policy paper, 2016-17).
