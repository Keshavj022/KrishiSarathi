 But Tamil Nadu has highest productivity (3246 kg/ha) of finger millet followed by Karnataka (1726 kg/ha) which is above the national average yield (1697 kg/ha). In Madhya Pradesh, both kodo and little millet are predominant, while foxtail millet is important in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Barnyard millet and proso millet are grown largely in hills of Uttarakhand, North-Eastern region and plains of North Bihar and western Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Browntop millet, known as Korale (Kannada) or Andakorra (Telugu) occupies only a few thousand hectares in the dryland Table 2.

Trend in yield levels of finger millet and other small millets Indian Farming 40 January 2023 tracts of Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border areas. The state-wise area, production and productivity of small millets are given in Table 4 and 5. The biggest small millets producing state is Karnataka (56% of total production) followed distantly by Tamil Nadu (14.0%) and Uttarakhand (9.3%). Rest of the states together contribute about one-fifth of the total production. In terms of cultivated area Karnataka has the highest proportion (48%) followed by Maharashtra (10.5%). Though Madhya Pradesh has more area under other small millets, its contribution to total production is less owing to poor yield levels in the predominantly grown kodo and little millet, and total production has high year to year fluctuations. Research and development efforts The goal of breeding small millets remains improvement of grain yield including maximization of biomass and the harvest index. Cultivars need to be developed depending on the location specific requirements of soil, rainfall, temperature, humidity, day length and cropping patterns. Nutrient-use efficiency, particularly nitrogen, both native and applied needs to be enhanced as small millets are in generally sown to poor soils. Breeding of dwarf varieties is an objective of intensive cultivation as lodging is a major problem. Being drought tolerant, water-use efficiency of these crops needs to be further improved.
