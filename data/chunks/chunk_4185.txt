 eye-appealing flesh quality and sweetness were not materialized in mateera varieties developed by the institute. Therefore, intensive breeding work was done involving AHW-19, AHW-65, Sugar Baby, Durgapura Meetha, Charleston and Mahobobi. A large number of progenies were generated using selected parents in combinations (F1, F2, BC1, BC2 and bi-parental) and evaluated. Four prioritized traits such as flesh quality, earliness, tolerant to cracking and yield behaviour under high temperature (>40°C) situations were kept to screen the progenies. In F6 generation, few progenies of cross combination of AHW-19 × Sugar Baby exhibited desirable trend for fruit flesh (colour, firmness, content and TSS) and yield. Fruit quality and yield potential of advanced family F6/a/10 was much superior and highly acceptable depicting internally as good as Sugar Baby and rind characters as mateera. This was further advanced under isolation and open pollinated progeny designated as F6/a (Thar Manak) and released during 2007. The developed variety is devoid of cracking and suitable for summer and rainy season cultivation under hot arid climate. AHW–19 It is multiple-use and rainfed growing selection. Female flowers start at 45 days and tender fruits (loiya) are available from 58 days of sowing. Ripen fruits are ready for first harvesting at 75-77 DAS, and 3.8-4.1 kg in weight, 30-33 cm in length and 60-65 cm in girth. Oblong shape fruits have dark green in clear stripes on smooth rind. It bears 3.1-3.4 ripen fruits/plant and yield is 192–386 q/ha. Flesh is pink, firm having good taste and Channel technology of mateera cultivation Field view of mateera crop in fruit bearing 8.0-8.4% sweetness. High in seeds, 489-527 number/fruit and weight of 100 seeds is 9.12-9.27 g. Seed is bold and khaki in colour. Thar Manak It is widely acceptable fruit quality selection and tolerant to drought, high temperature and abiotic stressed conditions. It is through hybridization from cross combination of AHW-19 × Sugar Baby. It is early in first harvesting (75 DAS) and high yielding (185–355 q/ha). Ripen fruits are oblong-round with dark green-green stripes on smooth rind. Fruits weigh 2.65-4.21 kg and are 20-22 cm in length and 58-62 cm in girth, and free from cracking. Flesh is attractive, reddish, firm, granular and have 9.5-11.2% TSS. Seeds are very big, bold, black and low (160-266 number/fruit). It is suitable for summer and rainy season irrigated crop and also rainfed cultivation during kharif. AHW-RSS–1 It is trait specific selection from native germplasm and high seed yielding under rainfed conditions. It is a short duration selection, fruit harvesting starts from 80 days and vine bears approximately 3.2 mature fruits. Fruit is big and oblong shape with no stripes, light green and smooth rind. Ripen fruits are 7.9 kg in weight, 32 cm in length and 68 cm in girth. Edible flesh firm but white in colour. Fruits are very high in seeds (950-1120 number) and weight of 100 seeds is 9.8 g.
