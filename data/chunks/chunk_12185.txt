Agroclimatic zones Considering diverse agroclimates, disease spectrum, rust pathotypes and cultural environments in barley-growing regions of India, different parts of the country have been grouped into six zones to facilitate organizing research programmes relevant to specific environments. This system also helps in giving location- specific recommendations. These zones are as follows. 7. Description of morphological features DUS testing guidelines notified by the PPV&FRA may be followed. Minimum traits required for that may be decided by the workshop. 24 GUIDELINES FOR TESTING CROP VARIETIES UNDER AICCIPS 8.
