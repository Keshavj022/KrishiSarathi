 As per the farmers awareness in India, UAVs are popular for surveillance and event photography because of which a flying drone is perceived as a moni­ toring tool. Due to this perception, the adoptability of drones may be opposed in rural areas. Interruption of existing work, age group of farmers, threat to property and animals, and noise pollution follow the Table 3 Fuzzy and defuzzified weight of barrier categories.

Considering the potential applications of UAVs in the agricultural sector, if considerable investments are made to carry out research ac­ tivities it can help overcome T5. This can consequently aid in over­ coming T2, T4, O5, O4, B7, and T6. It is also possible to reduce the cost of drones with the advent of new technology. Therefore, it is expected that all the barriers within the economic category can also be overcome with R&D. Majority of the existing drones have inbuilt ultrasonic sensors that can sense obstructions in the way. However, these obstructions are limited to specific directions. Giving special emphasis to fabricate drones that can sense obstructions in all directions can aid in over­ coming T3.
