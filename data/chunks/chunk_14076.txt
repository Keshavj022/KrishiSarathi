19% of farmers in EHR own livestock; the cropping intensity in TGPR is 180.42%, while it is only 140.27% in EHR; the irrigation intensity is 170.16% in TGPR, while it is only 64.18% in EHR; moreover, 33.92% of farmers in TGPR share their knowledge with fellow farmers, while corresponding ﬁgure is only 10.00% for EHR; lastly, more than 95.00% of farmers in TGPR receive remittance from their relatives working in urban areas, while the corresponding ﬁgure for EHR is only 3.00%. According to our ﬁndings, all the indicators of agricultural sustainability vary widely at district level. Based on the score of agri- cultural sustainability index, we divided all the 674 districts into three categories: low (0.00%–33.00%), medium (34.00%–66.00%), and high (67.00%–100.00%). About 21.07% of districts fall under high category of environmental sustainability, while only 13.20% fall under low category, and rest (65.73%) fall under medium category (Table 6). The majority of low environmental sustainability districts locate in the Andhra Pradesh (8 districts), Bihar (2 districts), Chhattisgarh (7 districts), Goa (1 district), Haryana (1 district), Kerala (1 district), and Uttar Pradesh (1 district), Gujarat (7 districts), Jharkhand (2 districts), Karnataka (12 districts), Maharashtra (24 districts), Punjab (5 dis- tricts), Tamil Nadu (6 districts), Telangana (8 districts), and West Bengal (4 districts) states, while the majority of high environmental sustainability districts belong to the Himalayan regions. The results of economic security index show that economic security exist relatively higher heterogeneity across districts, states, and agro-climatic regions of India (Table 6). The calculated district-level scores of economic security index show that about 32.20% of districts fall under low economic security category, while only 8.16% of districts fall under high category. The majority of low economic security districts mainly locate in the Arunachal Pradesh (15 districts), Assam (27 districts), Bihar (15 districts), Chhattisgarh (12 districts), Daman and Diu (1 district), Gujarat (1 district), Jammu and Kashmir (19 districts), Jharkhand (16 districts), Karnataka (3 districts), Manipur (6 districts), Madhya Pradesh (12 districts), Maharashtra (10 districts), Meghalaya (7 districts), Mizoram (8 districts), Nagaland (11 districts), Orissa (12 districts), Rajasthan (4 districts), Sikkim (4 districts), Tripura (2 districts), Uttar Pradesh (9 districts), Uttarakhand (9 districts), West Bengal (9 districts) states, while the majority of high economic security districts belong to Bihar (2 districts), Himachal Pradesh (2 districts), Uttar Pradesh (2 districts), Chandigarh (1 district), Chhattisgarh (1 district), Delhi (1 district), Dadra and Nagar Haveli (1 district), Kerala (1 district), Gujarat (4 districts), Karnataka (4 districts), Haryana (6 districts), Punjab (14 districts), Rajasthan (3 districts), Telangana (3 districts), and Tamil Nadu (9 districts) states.
