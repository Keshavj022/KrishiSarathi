 conica produced maximum growth in Asthana and Hawker’s solution (210.60 mg) and minimum in Czapek’s solution (60.30 mg). M. crassipes gave maximum growth in glucose asparagine solution (199.80 mg) and minimum in Czapek’s solution (111.80 mg), M. delociosa showed maximum growth in glucose asparagine solution (150.27 mg) and minimum in Dimmicks solution (35.9 mg) and M. esculenta showed maximum growth in glucose asparagine solution (200.0 mg) and minimum in Dimmicks solution (55.8 mg). Nutrient analysis Content of some of the nutritional components analysed for Morchella spp. are: moisture, fresh and dry weight, free amino acids, phosphorus, Table 12.

Nutritional analysis of Morchella spp Components Morchella spp Agaricus spp Moisture fresh weight (%) 84.15–88.45 78.3–89.05 Free amino acids (g/100 g dry wt.) 6.6–11.8 6.7–10.1 Phosphorus (g/100 g dry wt.) 1.20–1.26 1.48–1.52 Potassium (g/100 g dry wt.) 1.6–2.0 1.3–2.0 Total Protein content (g/100 g dry wt.) 31–36 23.9–30.8 Carbohydrate (%) 67.76 51.3–62.5 Nitrogen (% dry weight basis) 54.60 44.0–53.5  ETHNIC FOOD potassium and total protein, carbohydrate and nitrogen. The nutritional components were compared with that of Agaricus spp. The results (Table 13) suggest that free amino acids, total protein, carbohydrates and nitrogen content are more in Morchella, whereas moisture, fresh weight, phosphorus, potassium contents are higher in Agaricus. The protein content of Morchella is higher than of most of the vegetables, which can make a valuable addition to the nutritional aspects of vegetarian diet of human beings. CONCLUSION Mushrooms grow wild in nature and have been consumed by man since time immemorial. In Himachal Pradesh there are around 100 species of wild mushrooms, which are reported to be edible. Among the edible ones, no other mushroom can top morel for flavour and versatility. Himachal Pradesh, by virtue of its location and diversity in vegetation and climatic conditions, provides suitable habitats for morels to grow in plenty. The morels comprise the genus Morchella, commonly referred to as guchhi, in Indian market. At present, it is the costliest and most sought- after edible fungus in the world. The morels possess an excellent flavour and are highly appreciated for their culinary aspects. Even the mycelia of Morchella have been stated to have the same nutritive value as the fruiting bodies. Previously they have beencollected primarily for their delicacy and some medicinal value and for home consumption.
