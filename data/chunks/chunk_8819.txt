 PULSES CHICKPEA Crop Improvement RSG 888, a pedigree selection from RSG 44 × E 100Y, has been identified for rainfed areas of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh. The variety showed good level of resistance to dry root-rot and moderate against wilt. It matures in 150-160 days with average yield of 2.1 tonnes/ha. HK 94-134, a bold-seeded (26.7 g/100-seed) kabuli variety from a three-way cross (H 82-5 × E 100 Ym) × Bhim has been identified for irrigated areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. It matures in 120-140 days and gives an average yield of 1.5 tonnes/ha. Some of the promising donors having multiple disease resistance are IPC 97-1 and BGD 12 (wilt, collar-rot, dry root-rot and Ascochyta blight); FG 712 (wilt, collar-rot and Ascochyta); and IPC 97-7 (wilt and collar-rot). Chickpea CSJ146, Phule G 92926 and Phule G 93118 are found tolerant to both Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica. BG 1033 showed consistently less pod- borer damage. Of the 45 varieties, 31.23 tonnes of breeder seed have been produced against the DAC indent of 26.27 tonnes. Crop Production Use of 2 tonnes of vermicompost significantly improved grain yield of chickpea. JNC 6 niger a composite of 7 genetically diverse strains with wide adaptability and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses has been identified for release at the national level ● ●● ●● Identified RSG 888 chickpea for rainfed areas of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh and HK 94- 134 bold-seeded kabuli variety for irrigated areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. ● Pigeonpea Laxmi for Andhra Pradesh, resistant to sterility mosaic and wilt, and AKT 8811 for Maharashtra, tolerant to Fusarium wilt, have been released. ● Pigeonpea sowing on ridges reduced incidence of Phytophthora blight by 50% compared with flat sowing. IPC 97-1 chickpea showing wilt resistance in wilt-sick plot. This variety shows resistance to not only wilt but to collar-rot, dry-rot and Ascochyta blight CROP IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 33 Intercropping chickpea KWR 108 with linseed Neelam in 4:2 ratio gave maximum chickpea equivalent yield with higher net monetary returns. In chickpea, osmotic adjustment has been positively correlated with drought tolerance and grain yield. Early flowering genotypes ICC 4958, ICCV 92944 and ICCV 94916 have been best adapted to rainfed areas due to their high root biomass, low canopy temperature and maintenance of higher turgor and leaf water potential during terminal drought. Crop Protection At least 5 pathotypes of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri are suspected to be present in the country. Chickpea PG 95007, PBG 126, FG 703, ICC 10149, H 82-2, H 92-71, GNG 1000, ICC 11441, BG 372 and G 91061 have been identified as resistant to wilt. And GCP 9504, H 92-71, FG 711 and FG 712 have showed multiracial resistance against F. oxysporm f. sp. ciceri. Trichoderma harzianum has been more effective than T.
