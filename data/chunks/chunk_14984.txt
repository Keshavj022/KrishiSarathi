The households had some Preventive Health Expenditure, the information of which is used to compute the Sanitation Index. Thus, to make the HDI directly related to the health dimension, 1-the Standardized Health Dimension is used to calculate the HDIF. D. Sahoo et al. World Development Sustainability 4 (2024) 100127 6 And the HDIF is constructed as: HDIF = ∑DIi/3, i= Health, Education, and Income. The value of HDIF will lie between 0 to 1, i.e., (0 < (HDIF) < 1). Further, the Sanitation Index (SI) of the households is constructed by considering eight (08) indicators (I) of sanitation and they are 1) living in a pucca house; 2) availability of toilet facilities; 3) availability of bathroom facilities; 4) availability of purified drinking water facilities; 5) frequency of using soap for bathing purpose; 6) use of phenyl to clean bathroom, toilet, and surface; 7) use of hand wash; and 8) use of any detergent to clean utensil. The SI is calculated by using the method of weighted arithmetic mean (the weights being uniform) and is defined as:SI = ∑8 1Ii 8 . Possession of an indicator by the household is assigned the value “1” and non-possession of the indicator is “0”. The household having all the indicators will have SI=1 and having no indicators will have SI=0. Thus, the value of SI will lie between 0 to 1, i.e.,(0 < (SI) < 1). 4. Result and Discussion As mentioned earlier, the total effective number of households for the study is 996. The statistics of all the six dependent variables are presented in Table 4 and it reveals that except in the case of collection (storage) of seeds, the male members of the households dominate all other decisions on agricultural activities. In fact, the table reveals that men (73.29%) dominate the marketing decision on agricultural input that gives income to the households. Similarly, the statistics on other independent variables, control variables, and socio-economic, institu­ tional, and demographic variables indicate the presence of gender biasness among the agrarian households (Tables 5 and 6). Perusal of Tables 5 and 6 reveals that though more than 40% of the respondents are aware about the institutional framework to ensure land right to female. Meagre 4.82% households have women with land­ ownership. While 5.52% of the households have both men, and women as the landowners, in the rest of the households’ men exclusively own the land. Similarly, 81.63% of the households have knowledge about the availability of modern technology, though only 11.
