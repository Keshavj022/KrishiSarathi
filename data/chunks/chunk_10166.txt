 India will strive to help achieve these goals through development of improved agricultural technologies along with their efficient and effective modes of dissemination. It is estimated that the annual growth in the productivity of food grains should be more than 1.5% and that of horticultural crops more than 3% to meet this goal. This will essentially require development of improved varieties of field and horticultural crops with desirable traits under the changing environmental scenario. At the same time, technology will also be needed to increase the input use efficiency to reduce the cost of production and enhanced value addition to make Indian agriculture profitable, competitive and attractive to rural youth. In addition, value addition through processing will help in reducing colossal losses on one hand and increase the income of the farmers on the other. ICAR is ready to take up the challenges with focused research programs keeping in mind the recent developments in science and technology, changed economic environment and opportunities at national and international arenas for higher productivity, profitability, sustainability and climate resilience to meet the aspirations of Indian agriculture.
