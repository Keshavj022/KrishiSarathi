 In addition to their agricultural importance, lentils are a rich source of protein, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They are key to human nutrition since they are an alternative to animal proteins, decreasing meat consumption. Another characteristic of legumes, including lentils, is their ability to form nodules, which gives them a growth advantage in nitrogen-deficient soils because they enable the plant to fix atmospheric nitrogen, thus contributing nitrogen to the soil and facilitating the nutrition of other plants during intercropping. Lentils have also been applied for protection against various human diseases, as well as for phytoremediation, and they also have been applied as environmental bioindicators to identify cytotoxicity. This review addresses the importance of lentils in agriculture and human health. Keywords: bioremediation; biological nitrogen fixation; nodulation; lentil medical approaches; nutritional importance; sustainable agricultural systems 1. Introduction Legumes comprise approximately 750 genera and 19,300 species. They are primarily herbs, shrubs, vines, and trees [1]. Currently, three large groups of subfamilies are recog- nized: Mimosoideae, with 4 tribes and 3270 species; Papilionoideae, with 28 tribes and 13,800 species; and Caesalpinoidea, with 4 tribes and 2250 species [2]. The lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is a diploid legume (2n = 14) with a large genome of 4063 Mbp, is phylo- genetically nested within the tribe Vicieae, and belongs to the Papilionoideae subfamily of the Fabaceae family [3]. The importance of lentil cultivation lies in its resistance to drought and its ability to grow in a wide range of soils, from light to heavy, with a pH of 5.5â€“9; therefore, this legume production presents an encouraging panorama. Due to its low cultivation costs, it could become a magnificent option for the diversification of crops, taking advantage of marginal soils that otherwise would be left out of agricultural activities [4]. Regarding nutritional aspects, lentils contain proteins, carbohydrates, oils, and ash in proportions of 23%, 59%, 1.8%, and 0.2%, respectively, and also provide iron, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin A, and vitamin B [5,6]. Furthermore, worldwide lentil production has increased annually to an estimated 5.6 million hectares [7]. Lentils are important in the diet of low-income populations in developing countries because they replace animal proteins [8]. Another characteristic of legumes is their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) through symbiosis with bacteria called rhizobia through the formation of specialized structures called nodules, which is advantageous for growth in soils with low N2 content [9].
