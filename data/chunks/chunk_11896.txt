 Agro-biodiversity, Ecology and Agriculture: Gandhian Thoughts 64 Mahatma Gandhi’s Vision of Agriculture: Achievements of ICAR A total of about 1,27,000 species of animals, plants, and microbes are reported to occur in India. India has about 51,000 insect species, which constitute about 6% of the world’s insect fauna (Table 1). Of the collection of 160 major and minor crop species, only about 25 crop species were widely domesticated in India. In addition, native tribes have conserved and are cultivating about 1,500 wild edible plant species (NAAS 1998). All these together form a precious reservoir of genes needed by the plant breeders for development of superior crop varieties (Arora 1994; Tiwari 2006). In addition, explorers and visitors from abroad introduced many new crops and their cultivars. Thus, India has both indigenous plant resources, their wild relatives, as well as species introduced from across the world. Few examples of such introductions includes cereals like wheat, maize, barley, and oats; oilseeds like soybean, groundnut and sunflower; pulses- chickpea, peas, and French bean; fiber crop like cotton; medicinal plants; vegetables like potato, tomato, cauliflower, cabbage, onion and carrot; fruits like grapes, apple, pear, peach, apricot, and cherry.

They played a major role in the augmentation of crop resources in this region (Arora and Nayar 1984). Similarly, vast diversity occurs in natural habitats for medicinal and aromatic plant species and for forage grasses. Many of the medicinal plants genetic resources have great industrial 65 applications for instance Cymbopogon spp., Emblica officinalis, Nardostachys jatamansi, Ocimum spp., Podophyllum hexandrum, Rauvolfia serpentina and Swertia chirayata. Different biodiversity hotspots in India collectively have more than 400 species of legume forages (Arora and Chandel 1972). These include Alysicarpus, Astragalus, Caragana, Cicer, Crotolaria, Desmodium, Indigofera, Lespedeza, Medicago, Melilotus, Pueraria, Rhyncosia, Smithia and Trigonella., Over 1250 species occur among grasses of which about 600 are considered as promising wild forages. India is endowed with rich animal genetic resources.
