 This variety may be capable for increasing extra net return of farmers due to higher yield with very rich nutritional quality, as compared to other wheat varieties. The area under this variety has now spread to more than 27,500 ha. Farmers are satisfied with the yield of this variety and also claim that it is better in quality. A view of bio-fortified wheat variety DBW-187 in farmer’s field CASE STUDY Bio-fortified Wheat Variety DBW-187 (Karan Vandana) : A Successful Cultivation icar annual report 2022-23 186 Cluster Frontline Demonstration on Oilseeds: During reporting period, 18,301.31 ha area was covered under 46,519 demonstrations on oilseed crops across the country. In kharif season 6,207.97 ha area (15,141 demonstrations), in rabi season 10,414.44 ha area (27,298 demonstrations) and in summer season 1,679.00 ha area (4,080 demonstrations) was covered. On national level, the average yield advantage in major oilseed crops were recorded as 38.40 % however, it was highest in Toria (59.35 %) followed by Castor (39.28 %), Soyabean (38.62 %), Niger (37.57 %), Sesame (36.50 %), Groundnut (36.48 %), Mustard (36.17 %), Safflower (35.40 %), Linseed (34.52 %) and Sunflower (30.07 %). This was possible due to farmers’ awareness, suitable technology interventions and skill developed among farmers by the KVKs activities. Other Frontline Demonstrations A total of 1,58,617 Frontline Demonstrations (FLDs other than CFLDs including 10,0152 FLDs on crops covering 26,225.83 ha area, 17,121 demonstration on farm machineries covering 9,750.39 ha area, 18,880 FLDs on livestock and fisheries, 16,880 demonstrations on other enterprises and 5,864 FLDs on gender-specific technologies for women empowerment were organized. Cereals: Among 33,588 FLDs on cereal crops, 10,661 FLDs were conducted on 231 technology options on wheat varieties and management technologies in 3,724.04 ha area by 271 KVKs. The average yield in the demonstrations was 12.20 % higher than the farmers’ practice. A total of 504 varietal and technology options were demonstrated in 18,848 FLDs in 4,625.52 ha area on rice varieties and technologies by 434 KVKs in which the average yield in demonstration was 21.03 % higher than the farmers’ practice. On maize varieties and technologies, 134 KVKs conducted 131 varietal and technology options in 3,616 FLDs and 1,074.76 ha area wherein the yield increase was 25.71% in the demonstrations over farmer’s practice. Demonstrations were also conducted on barley and oats. Millets: Among 3,030 FLDs on millets, the highest number of 48 varietal and technology options were demonstrated on finger millet by 52 KVKs in 1,278 FLDs wherein the average yield was 47.78% higher than the farmer’s practice. Varieties and technologies on pearl millet (35) and sorghum (35) demonstrated in 633 and 500 FLDs showed 27.03 % and 28.57 % higher average yield than farmer’s practice.
