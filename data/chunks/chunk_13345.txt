Table 11. SMD-wise per cent employees of various categories undergone training S: Scientist; T: Technical including Drivers; Admn: Administrative including Finance & Stenographers; SSS: Skilled Support Staff 9.3 Trainings Organized Based on 2 years√≠ mean data (2016-18), the average number of training programmes organized for Scientists, Technical including Drivers, Administrative including Finance and Stenographers, and Skilled Support Staff were 244, 117, 45 and 64, respectively with overall 470 trainings for all categories of employees (Fig. 6) which is slightly less compared to 2014-16 particularly in case of Scientists and Administrative Staff and also aggregate of all the categories. Data also showed that there is continuous increase in number of trainings organized for Technical and Skilled Support Staff due to more emphasis given on these categories. Compared to 2013-14, ICAR-Institutes organized 74.6 and 1180.0% more average number of training programmes for Technical and Skilled Support Staff, respectively with overall 7.3% more training programmes were organized during 2016-18 (Fig 6).
