 India is a leading exporter of rainfed crops like spices, oilseeds, and pulses, and with better market linkages, rainfed farmers can significantly increase their earnings. Government initiatives like the Agriculture Export Policy aim to strengthen the infrastructure and regulatory framework to facilitate easier access to global markets for smallholder farmers. By embracing these opportunities, rainfed agriculture in India can become a more resilient and sustainable sector, contributing not only to the nation’s food security but also to rural development and climate change mitigation. With the right blend of technology, policy support, and market access, rainfed farmers can enhance their livelihoods and play a crucial role in the country’s agricultural future SUMMARY Rainfed agriculture, despite its challenges, is a vital component of the global food system. By understanding the key challenges and opportunities, we can work towards building more resilient and productive rainfed agricultural systems. The main challenges facing rainfed agriculture include climate variability, soil degradation, pest and disease outbreaks, and lack of infrastructure. Climate change is exacerbating these challenges, making it more difficult for farmers to adapt and thrive. However, there are also significant opportunities for sustainable development in rainfed agriculture. Climate-resilient agriculture practices, technological advancements, policy support, and market diversification can help farmers build resilience and improve their livelihoods. Addressing the challenges and seizing the opportunities requires a concerted effort from governments, farmers, researchers, and civil society organizations. By working together, we can create a sustainable future for rainfed agriculture that benefits both current and future generations. As we look ahead, we must ask ourselves: What can we do to ensure that rainfed agriculture remains a viable and sustainable source of food and livelihoods in the face of climate change and other challenges? The answer lies in our collective commitment to innovation, collaboration, and a sustainable future. *Corresponding author email : director.crida@icar.gov.in Indian Farming 9 January 2025 Integrating soil resource information for sustainable soil management and climate-resilient rainfed agriculture H. Biswas*, U. Surendran, M. S. Raghuvanshi and N. G. Patil ICAR-National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning, Nagpur, Maharashtra 440 033 Rainfed agriculture plays a pivotal role in India's food security, covering nearly 52% of the country's net sown area and supporting the livelihood of millions of farmers. However, it is vulnerable to erratic rainfall patterns, soil degradation, and climate change impacts. Sustainable soil management in rainfed regions is essential for maintaining soil fertility, improving water-use efficiency, and ensuring food security.
