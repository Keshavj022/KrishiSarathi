 Other chemical parameters include calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), chloride (Cl−) and bicarbonate (HCO3 –) were measured using a titration method with AgNO3 (silver nitrate) solution and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) with the accuracy of ± 0.05 mg/l for Ca2+ and Mg2+, ±0.1 mg/l for Cl−and ± 0.2 mg/l for HCO3 –. Sulfate (SO4 2−) concentrations were measured using a UV spec­ trometer (Labman UV-1200) with an accuracy of ± 0.1 mg/l. The ion selective electrodes (ISE) of the LABMION-40 instrument has been used fluoride (F-) abundance with the accuracy of ± 0.1 mg/l. Similarly, a flame photometer (model 130 Systronics) instrument was used to test the potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) concentrations owith the accuracy of ± 2 %. All the parameters were analysed as per the guidelines pro­ vided in the American Public Health Association’s Standard Methods (APHA 2005). 2.2.1. Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) QA/QC are important in groundwater chemistry because they ensure the data collected is reliable, accurate, and suitable for the use for which it is aimed (Karunanidhi et al., 2024a). In this study, comprehensive QA and QC procedures have been adopted. The laboratory protocols for sample transport and storage were closely followed along with con­ ventional procedures for sample collection, labelling, analysis, and data verification. In addition to guarantee reliable results, 500 ml samples were meticulously separated and analysed in the lab. Eventually, ion balance error was calculated to assess the accuracy of the laboratory results (Karunanidhi et al., 2024b;Atkinson 2024, Clinton-Ezekwe et al., 2024, Raj et al., 2025). The ionic balance, accuracy evaluation was performed using the ion balancing error (IBE) technique using the for­ mula (Eq. (1)) as < 5 %. IBE = [(∑C+ − ∑A−) / (∑C++ ∑A−)] *100 (1) where the A−are Cl−, NO3 –, SO4 2−, HCO3 –, and while the C+ are K+, Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. 2.3. Irrigation water quality In irrigation water, various salts are dissolved. The salinity of irri­ gation water has a significant effect on soil salinity, controlling plant development, and primary production (Al-Hawas 2002; Badr et al., 2023). Many aspects of water quality parameters have complex effect on crop production, soil properties, and irrigation water quality (Batarseh et al., 2021). Water quality affects agricultural yield and assessment of soil salinity or alkalinity plays a vital role in evaluating water quality (Rao., 2016; Sakram et al. 2022). Meq/L units are used to express all ions. In irrigation assessment metrics, including SAR, %Na, PI, RSC, KR, and MHR, were calculated, using the following equations (Eqs. (2)–(7)). SAR = Na+ ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ Ca2++Mg2+ 2 √ (2) %Na = Na+ Ca2+ + Mg2+ + Na+ + k+ × 100 (3) RSC=(HCO3 –) − (Ca2++Mg2+) (4) PI = Na+ + ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ HCO− 3 √ Ca2+ + Mg2+ + Na+ × 100 (5) Table 1 Classification of Irrigation water quality Index (IWQI) base­ d on plant tolerance and soil properties (Meireles et al.
