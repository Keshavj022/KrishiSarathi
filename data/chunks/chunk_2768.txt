 T-1 plants (gfOMl in glasshoose) were sampled by Dhatwad group <rid leaves were brought 10 NRCPB from january 2003 on wards. Southerns we-e repeated about three times and were canplete by mid-2003. T-<4 plants were raised in glasshouse at UAS-O and leaf sanples were.sent 10 Delhi by courier in moist pdythene bags (8 couple 0( times) in January 2005. As mentioned above, these plants were young raised fran fresh seed cdlected from 2004-2005 plants.. Reganing the information frml Or Kalageri about T-2 generation raised in 2003-04. I sh~ go with his laboratory records. Sincerely Dr P.

Kranthi, Director, CICR, Nagpur on April OS, 2012 - 1. How was the work on the development of'BN-Bt' cotton divided among the three institutions, namely NRCPB, VAS and CICR? - BN-Bt was developed under NATP project 1999 to 2004. Details of the roles of institutions are clearly mentioned in the current science paper: Genetic transformation of an elite Indian genotype ofcotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) for insect resistance. 2007. I. S. Katageri, H. M. Varnadevaiah, S. S. Udikeri, B. M. Khadi and Polumetla A. Kumar. Current Science, 93,1843-1847. - a) NRCPB was to provide gene constructs, confirm gene integration, event characterization and assess expression b) VAS Dharwad for transformation ofBikaneri Narma (BN), and Sahana c) CICR for transformation of LRA 5166 and LRK 516. 2. In your opinion wbat is the order of tbese institutions on tbe basis of their contribution in tbe development of Bikaneri Nerma Bt (BN-Bt) and 'Bt NHH 44'? - ...,. - - The Current Science paper, 2007 is a published document that describes the entire methodology used to develop BN-Bt and the institutions where the development.took place. The same may please be referred to for clarity on the contribution of individuals and their affiliation with institutions. a) VAS Dharwad developed the event 'BNLA601 ' through transformation and regeneration of BN to produce BN-Bt and Bt NHH 44. UAS Dharwad also produced the seed.
