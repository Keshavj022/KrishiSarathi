 Keeping in view the long felt demand of French fry variety, the institute developed and released Kufri Frysona for north Indian plains in 2009 and another variety Kufri FryoM recommended for release in 2018. Kufri Chipsona-1 (MP/90-83) The variety is a selection from the progeny of the cross CP2416 × MS/78-79. The female parent CP2416 was the Mexican genotype MEX 750826, while the male parent MS/78-79 was from Indian potato breeding programme which involved Kufri Jyoti and EM/H-1601 in its parentage. The variety produces white-cream ovoid tuber with shallow eyes and white-cream flesh. The variety produces nearly 30-35 t/ha yield under north Indian plains of the country. Its dry matter content is 20-23% and reducing sugar content is 10-75 mg/100 g fresh weight. The variety yields processing grade tubers to the tune of 60-75%. The variety has good late blight resistance and is well adapted to Indo-Gangetic plains. The tubers possess excellent keeping quality. The variety is suitable for making chips, french fries and flakes. Kufri Chipsona-2 (MP/91-G) The variety is a selection from the progeny of the cross CP2346 (F-6 from Peru) × QB/B 92-4. The female parent CP2346 is an accession from the germplasm collection received from International Potato Centre, Lima, November–December 2019 13 The tubers have dry matter content of 21-24% and reducing sugars 10-80 mg/ 100 g fresh weight. The variety has a high degree of resistance to late blight. The variety is suitable for chips and flakes making. Kufri Chipsona-4 (MP/01-916) The variety is selection from the progeny of cross Atlantic × MP/92-35. It produces high yield with higher proportion of chip grade tubers. It has early maturity with field resistance to late blight, thus helping farmers in saving on costly fungicides. The variety produces white- cream round-ovoid tuber with shallow eyes and white flesh. The variety produces nearly 18-22 t/ha yield during kharif crop in Karnataka and 30-35 t/ha tuber yield in rabi crop in plains of the country. It is suitable for preparation of chips owing to its round-ovoid shape, high dry matter (>20%) and low reducing sugars (40-80 mg/ 100 g fresh weight). It will fill the void of a suitable chipping variety from Karnataka, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh where processors are in need of variety combining high tuber yield and high level of late blight resistance. Long dormancy and good keeping quality will help storage of this variety for longer period thus ensuring round the year availability of raw material to chipping industry. Kufri Frysona (MP/98-71) The variety is selection from the progeny of MP/90- 30 × MP/90-94. It produces attractive white-cream long oblong tubers with shallow eyes and white flesh. The variety produces nearly 30-35 t/ha tuber yield in rabi crop in plains of the country. It possesses very good field resistance against late blight disease and has reasonably good frost tolerance.
