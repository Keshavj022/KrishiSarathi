 It affects most of the world’s population at some point in their lifecycle during infancy to old age. Every country experiences one or the other form of malnutrition. It affects all geographies, age groups and people from rich to poor. Malnutrition exists in different forms5: • Undernutrition: Lack of proper nutrition caused by not having enough food. • Stunting: Low height as per age in children under five years of age due to limited access to food, health and care. • Wasting: Thin for their height in children under five years of age because of acute food shortages or disease. • Micronutrient deficiencies: Suboptimal nutritional status caused by lack of intake, absorption or use of one or more vitamins or minerals. • Moderate and severe thinness or underweight: A body mass index (BMI = weight in kg/height in m2) <18.5 indicates underweight in adult populations, while a BMI <17.0 indicates moderate and severe thinness. • Overweight and obesity: Excessive weight as per height is classified as overweight and obesity in adults. BMI ≥25 is considered overweight, while ≥30 is treated as obesity. Types of malnutrition 2 Indian Council of Agricultural Research The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is a tool for comprehensively measuring and tracking hunger at global, regional, and national levels over recent years and decades6. GHI score is based on a formula that involves three dimensions of hunger, viz., (i) insufficient caloric intake (undernourishment) in the population, (ii) undernutrition among children, and (iii) child mortality using four indicators6: • Undernourishment: Share of the population that is undernourished, reflecting insufficient caloric intake. • Child wasting: Share of children (<5 years) who possess low weight for height, reflecting acute undernutrition. • Child stunting: Share of children (<5 years) who possess low height for age, reflecting chronic undernutrition. • Child mortality: Mortality rate of children (<5 years). • GHI of 2021 stands at 17.9 (moderate) down from 20.4 (serious) in 2012, 25.1 (serious) in 2006 and 28.0 (serious) in 20006. • Of the 116 countries, 49 countries fall under ‘low’, 30 countries are under ‘moderate’ category. 31 countries possess GHI score of ‘serious’ category, with 5 countries are in ‘alarming’ category. One country fell under the ‘extremely alarming’ category6. • GHI score of India is 27.5 (moderate) during 2021, down from 28.8 (serious) in 2012, 37.4 (alarming) in 2006 and 38.8 (alarming) in 20006.
