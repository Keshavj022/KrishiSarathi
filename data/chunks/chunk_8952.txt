 A marginal increase of about 3% was noticed in Bombayduck landings which were about 96,700 tonnes in the year 2000. The non penaeid prawn landings during 2000 were about 151,500 tonnes which was about 2-4% more than the previous year. An increase of 22% was noticed in the landings of catfish which was about 57,600 tonnes during the year 2000. Status of Deep Sea Prawn Resources Exploitation of the deep sea prawns was continued along the south-west coast of India at depths ranging from 175-400 m by shrimp trawlers. The total catch declined from 25,247 tonnes at a catch rate of 53 kg in 1999-2000 to 10,042 tonnes at a catch rate of 31 kg/hr during 2000-01. Contribution of pandalid prawns to the fishery Deep sea prawn landings ● The marine fish productions in India was estimated at 2.7 million tonnes ● Fish yield assessment of five reservoirs of southern Rajasthan was conducted. The fish yield in the reservoirs ranged from 23.0 to 172 kg/ ha with dominance of major and minor carps ● The fishery and biology of prawns in Kayamkulam backwaters of Kerala were studied. Penaeus indicus, Metapenaeus deobsoni and M. monoceros contributed substantially to the total catch ● Identification and cataloguing of potential ornamental fish species have been done in the north-eastern states and West Bengal ● A qualitative health assessment index (HAI) for rapid evaluation of fish condition in the field was developed. The general health status of fish populations in river Hooghly was evaluated ● Mahseer fishery was developed in a lake in Champawat district of Uttaranchal ● A breakthrough has been achieved in spawning Asian catfish, Clarias batrachus spontaneously ● The seed production trials of Gangetic prawn, Macrobrachium gangeticum were carried out ● The giant freshwater prawn, M. rosenbergii cultured in pens installed in beels for a period of 92-95 days attained a size range of 135 m/38 g to 148 mm/57 g ● Trout Onchorhynchus mykiss was reared in the warmer agro-climatic conditions of Champawat where water quality was uncongenial for trout farming ● Cage culture experiment of mahseer has been conducted. After 150 days of culture the average net weight of Tor khudree increased from 35.2 g to 106 g and the average net weight of Tor putitora from 14.6 g to 52.4 g FISH PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING 125 declined from 78% to 49% during the current year. While adults represented the fishery during 1999-2000, juveniles contributed more in 2000-01. Unlike the coastal species, the deep sea prawns are highly susceptible to overexploitation due to their long life span, slow growth rate and low fecundity. Restriction on exploitation by introducing catch quota system or limited entry of fishing vessels are the various management measures to be considered for implementation. Revalidation of Potential Yield Estimate in the Indian EEZ The potential yield estimates of marine fishery resources in the Indian EEZ were revalidated by using recent data. The revalidated estimates is 3.
