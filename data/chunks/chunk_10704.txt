(Source: Department of Chemicals & Petro-Chemicals, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers) Indian Farming January 2022 19 Smart Fertilizers —A boon for Indian agriculture Praveen K Jaga* and V K Garg JNKVV, College of Agriculture, GanjBasoda (Vidisha), Madhya Pradesh 464 221 In recent years, there has been a concern regarding the quantity of mineral fertilizers used in agriculture that adversely affect the environment. Attention has been drawn to the fact that when nutrients are applied to crops, they are not all taken up by the plants immediately. There is also concern that some farmers might be applying inappropriate quantities of fertilizer. The main fertilizers having adverse effects on the environment are nitrate, phosphate and organic matter such as animal manure. In the coming future, there will be increasing pressure on global food systems and Indian agriculture will have the challenge to feed growing population without impacting environment quality. Application of smart fertilizers or rather smart input management is the key to supply sufficient food. Smart fertilization strategy has a great potential to achieve greater crop production and decrease the negative impact on the environment.
