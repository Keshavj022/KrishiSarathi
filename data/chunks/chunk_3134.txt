 Cost of operation of this machine is Rs. 500/t against Rs. 1500/t by traditional method. www.icar.org.in 13 2002 ‐ 2007 4.16. Tractor operated straw combine: Straw combine is used to recover wheat straw after combine operation and is operated by a tractor. Straw collected by straw combine is cut into pieces and collected in a trolley. The capacity of machine on an average is 0.4 ha/h while operating at a speed of 2.5km/h and straw recovery is about 55‐60%. The cost of operation is Rs. 1200/ha. There is an additional grain recovery of 50‐100 kg/ha. 4.17. High capacity multi‐crop thresher: Mechanical threshing of crops has been adopted in Indian Agriculture in a big way. Power wheat threshers were introduced in 1960s in India. Threshers can so adjusted so that oil seeds and pulses can be threshed and damage and losses to the grains are minimized. Sometimes, concave needs to be changed. The grain output capacity is 16‐20 q/h for wheat, 8‐10 q/h for raya, 6‐8 q/h for gram and 4‐5 q/h for green gram. Threshing efficiency, un‐threshed grain and visible damage are 98‐99%, 1.5‐2.0% and 1.0% respectively. Average total losses are about 5%. For moong crop, two cutting blades (out of four) need to be removed to reduce the damage. The average capacity of thresher is 4.0 q/h for moong and 5.0 q/h for guar crop. The breakage is less than 5.0% for moong and 0.5 to 2.0% for guar. Threshing efficiency and cleaning efficiency are with in the prescribed limit. The expenditure involved is Rs. 250‐300/h. The net saving per year is estimated to be Rs. 86,000/‐ and the pay back period of machine is one year. 14 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Agricultural Engineering www.icar.org.in All India Coordinated Research Project on Application of Post Harvest Technology 1.

Sorting and analysis of collected data is currently in progress. • Popularization of ‘TNAU insect trap’ This is a simple and low cost probe to trap pests from stored food grains at domestic level, taking advantage of the wondering behavior of insects towards air pockets.
