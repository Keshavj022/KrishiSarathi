 Since its inception (1998), around 19 crore Kisan Credit Cards have been issued so far (till 2019-20), attracting farmers to the formal financial institutions. The introduction of the direct benefit transfer approach in the fertilizer industry, direct income transfers to the farmers through PM-KISAN, and digitalization of rural land records are the other major initiatives at this front. The gradual emergence of the private sector in the agro-advisory services in recent years marks an improvement in information governance for the welfare of the farmers. The entry of Amazon Retail in India to offer agronomy services, the collaboration of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) with the Digital India Corporation (DIC) for extending tele-advisory services, the joint efforts of Microsoft and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) for sowing advisories, and the partnership of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (MoAFW) with private companies to take forward the digital agriculture are few among several signs of transition. Indian Agriculture after Independence 392 4. Property rights, partnerships, and donors As a result of the World Trade Organisation Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement in 1995, India opted for a sui generies system for the protection of plant varieties through the Protection of Plant Varieties & Farmers Right Act in 2001. Over the years, there had been an increase in the total number of varieties registered under this act. The data on varieties filed under PPVFR Act for the period 2009-2021 (Table 7) shows that out of all varieties registered, around 39.78% of the varieties were registered by farmers, 21.14% were from ICAR, 29.61% from the private organizations, and 8.61% from the State Agricultural Universities (SAUs).

To comply with the TRIPS agreement, the Patent Act was amended in 2007 to accommodate chemicals. The number of patents filed in India has increased gradually, as a result of successive amendments made in the Indian Patent Act in 1999, 2002, and 2005. But both in absolute and relative terms, India lags behind several countries. It currently ranks 14th in the total global patent filing in the agriculture and allied sector. The monetary value out of the patent system is paid limited attention, and patents are used as a protection mechanism rather. Preservation of innovations and preventing competitors from claiming priority over the invention has become the key focus. 4.1.
