 Specific traits like drought and sub-mergence tolerance, disease resistance and improved nutrition quality have been introgressed in 47 varieties of field crops using genomic tools like marker assisted selection (MAS) in comparison to eight before 2014. 71 crop varieties either bio- fortified with higher levels of Fe, Zn, protein, pro-vitamin A etc. in the edible parts or with reduced level of anti- nutritional factors were developed during 2014-21 against only one variety during 2007- 14. A total of 11282 quintals of breeder seed of 29 such varieties have been produced during 2016-17 to 2020-21. ICAR is the nodal agency for coordination of Breeder Seed production. The breeder seed production increased from 7.11 lakh qtls in 2007-14 to 8.19 lakh qtls during 2014-2021. The seed replacement rate in pulses, oilseeds and cereals increased substantially over time. Over the years, there has been a lot of great work in the country in the research and development of such seeds; and I congratulate all the agricultural universities and agricultural scientists for the same. While only one variety of this type reached farmers before 2014, today 70 Bio-fortified Varieties of different crops are available to farmers. I am glad that some of these bio-fortified varieties have been developed with the help of local and traditional crops. Prime Minister (On the occasion of the 75th Anniversary of FAO, October 16 2020) DARE-ICAR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS 2014-2021 15 Pulses Revolution During last 7 years the pulses production increased by 6.5 million tons from 18.23 m tons (TE 2013/14) to 24.73 million tons (TE 2020/21). The productivity has also increased by more than 100 kg/ha. ICAR played a catalytic role by making quality seeds of HYVs available to farmers through the 130 seed hubs and cluster demonstrations organised by KVKs. The enhanced production has drasticalluy cut the imports bills of the country. The pulses imports were cut by Rs. 18223.61 crore in 2019-20 comared to 2016/17. Sugar Revolution During 2014/2021 the cumulative sugarcane production was 2565.5 million tons with average 34.7 million tons increase in production every year over 2322.3 million tons of sugarcane production achieved in TE 2007/08. The productivity increased by over 9 tons per ha over 2013/14. The improved varieties like Co 0238 were the prime contributors to this sugar revolution in the country. This variety produces more than 20 tons cane per ha over the best existing varieties and hence occupied over 80% sugarcane area in U.P. and other northern States. The sugar recovery is close to 12%. The farmers were benefitted with an average yield gain by Rs. 51239/year due to higher yields and sugar recovery. Demonstrations and trainings on sugarcane technologies and working with sugar millers have given additional benefits of Rs. 23541 crores to sugar mills and Rs. 43468 crores to farmers during 2014-15 to 2019-20. The export of surplus sugar earned the country Rs. 13923 crores.
