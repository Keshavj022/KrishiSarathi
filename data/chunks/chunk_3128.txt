 From the data obtained, mean values for source wise percentage of accidents and accident incidence rates per 1000 machines were calculated. The accidents due to tractors were highest i.e. 24.5% followed by threshers 10.1%, sprayers 8.3%, chaff cutters 7.2%, electric motors and pump sets 3.5%. The accident incidence rates per 1000 machines were 24.1 for tractors, 13.9 for threshers, 4.4 for sprayers, 3.8 for chaff cutters, 1.1 for electric motors/pump sets and 18.9 for cane crushers. Based on the data collected, the number of accidents per 100,000 workers were estimated to be 200.4 whereas the number of fatalities were 21.2. b) As the small sample survey showed the seriousness of the agricultural accident situation, a large sample size survey was carried out in 2004‐05 in Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa and in 2005‐06 in Punjab. The data were collected from 240 villages each in Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Punjab, and from 360 villages in Madhya Pradesh. The mean values for no. of accidents per 100,000 workers were 1278 and the number. of fatalities per 100,000 workers were 12.4. On the basis of the data collected through survey, each centre has worked out a survey, package of safety measures for their respective states. The package consists of recommendation related to engineering, education and enforcement aspects and efforts are being made to promote these package of safety measures through State Govt. Agencies. 1.2 Status of adoption of safety measures on threshers The PAU centre and TNAU centre have carried out studies on status of adoption of safety measures on threshers. It was observed that inspite of Dangerous Machine Regulation Act 1983 being in force since last two decades, a large number of threshers manufactured in these states do not meet the guidelines given by Indian Standard IS 9020‐2002. Programmes have been undertaken to create awareness about the same. 8 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Agricultural Engineering www.icar.org.in 1.3 Status of adoption of safety measures on chaff cutters PAU centre carried out a study to know the status of adoption of safety features on chaff cutters in Punjab state. The study revealed that more than 70% of the chaff cutters did not have safety gadgets/provisions as given in Indian standards namely IS: 11459‐1995 (Power operated chaff cutter ) and IS 7898‐2001 ( Manually operated chaff cutter). 1.4 Safety gadgets for sugarcane crushers TNAU centre adopted /developed safety gadgets for sugarcane crushers which include feed plate or feed chute as per BIS specification (IS 1973:1999, Sugarcane crusher‐specifications), a tool for lubrication of the transmission system, and a hook for removing the bagasse from the sugarcane crusher outlet. 1.5 Farm safety promotion programmes The ESA centres are regularly carrying out farm safety promotion programmes to create awareness amongst farmers and workers to minimize agricultural accidents.
