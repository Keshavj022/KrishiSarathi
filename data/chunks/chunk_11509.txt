 Sowing of wheat should be completed by 25th November for timely sown varieties however, for late sown condition, early maturing varieties be sown between 25th November to 15th December. For timely sown condition, seed rate should be 100-125 kg/ha however for late sown condition, 125-150 kg seed should be sown per hectare. Before sowing, seed should be treated by Carboxin @ 2 g per kg seed. Row to row spacing should be 20 cm. However, 100 to 120 kg Nitrogen, 60 kg Phosphorus and 40 kg Potash should be applied as a blanket application. Actual quantity of nutrients should be ase3d on soil health tests. Irrigation should be applied at critical Root initiation, tillering, jointing, booting, flowering, milk, and dough stages in case of sufficient water availability to fetch maximum yield. For weed management, Metsulfuron methyl 1.6-gram active ingredient per acre @ 25-30 days after sowing should be applied for effective control of broad leaf weeds under optimum moisture condition in the field. Pinoxaden, 16-20-gram active ingredient per acre @ 320-400 gram/m.l. should be applied @ 25-30 days after ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 333 sowing for narrow leaf weed control. Pinoxaden + Carfentrazone (20+8 g active ingredient) should be applied @ 25-30 days after sowing for controlling all types of weeds under optimum moisture condition. Chickpea Chickpea is a major pulse crop of Chhattisgarh plains. Following improved varieties are recommended for cultivation: G.G.-1 (Gujarat Gram-1), JAKI-9218, J.G.-16, Vaibhav, J.G.-130, J.G.G.-1, J.G.-14, Indira Chana-1, J.S.C.-55, J.S.C.-56, B.G.D.-128 (Pusa Shubhra), I.P.C.K.-2002-29, I.P.C.K.-2004-29, I.P.C.-2066-77. According to soil type and availability of irrigation or time of sowing any one of the above varieties can be selected for sowing. Kanhar soils of Chhattisgarh plains are suitable for chickpea cultivation. Sowing should be done between 15th October to 30th November. Seed rate for timely sowing chickpea should be 75-80 kg per hectare however, if sowing is delayed beyond 30th November, then seed rate should be increased by 25 kg/ha. In some parts of Chhattisgarh, utera crop is also taken, in case of utera (Relay), seed rate should be 100 kg/ha. Seed should be treated by Carbendazim @ 2 g per kg seed for protection from soil borne fungal diseases. After treatment with fungicide seed should be treated by Rhizobium and P.S.B. Culture @ 5 g/kg seed followed by Trichoderma @ 5 g/ha seed, treated seed should be shade dried before sowing. Sowing of chickpea should be done with the row spacing of 30 cm. 20 kg Nitrogen, 40 kg Phosphorus, 20 kg Potash and 20 kg Sulphur should be given as basal dose. For good yield light irrigation should be insured at branching and flowering stage. Gram pod borer is the major insect of chickpea. For managing the insect apply Nuclear Polyhydrosis Virus 250 L.E. @ 500 litre water per hectare at morning and evening time.
