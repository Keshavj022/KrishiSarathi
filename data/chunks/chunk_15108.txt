 Specifically, enumerators were able to spend over an order of magnitude more time with respondents in person. As a result, in-person surveys generated substantially more data, including produc- tion volume for a wider range of crops as well as detailed modules on household income, consumption, and food storage. The ability to reach desired respondents and the breadth of data per respondent add additional dimensions to the tradeoff between cost and precision when selecting a mode of survey for program evaluation.
