 Regular collection and use of crop waste, generated in routine, or those which can be obtained from dropping of foliage from nearby trees and lawns should be placed in gaps as mulching material. Mulching and its drenching with bio-enhancer will help in quality production. If possible, after thorough filtrations, these can be used as foliar spray.
