 About six-fold increase in food grain production, more than five-fold increase in rice production, over sixteen-fold increase in wheat and maize productions, eleven-fold increase in cotton and jute, six-fold increase in oilseed and sugarcane and more than three-fold increase in pulses production have been achieved over the last seven and half decades. India ranks number one globally, in the production of pulses, pearl millet and cotton, and second in wheat, rice, groundnut, rapeseed & mustard and sugarcane. The country has emerged as the largest exporter of rice in the recent past. Such achievements became possible with the innovations in technologies including high-yielding varieties, irrigation, fertilizer, and farm policies. The agricultural sector is the primary source of livelihood for about 58% of the population in the country. The share of agriculture in the gross domestic product (GDP) is about 17% about half of which is contributed by the agricultural crops (MoF 2020-21). The food grain production in India has reached an all-time high to 314.51 million tons (Mt) in 2021-22. In the pre-Green Revolution period (1951-52 to 1966-67), India was heavily dependent Achievements in Field Crops in Independent India 75 on food imports. The Post-Green Revolution (1967-68 to 1985-86) period, however, experienced a visible acceleration and food grain production doubled from 74.2 Mt to 150 Mt. The production has again doubled from 150 Mt in 1985-86 to 314.51 Mt in 2021-22 but it took longer time of about 35 years due to deceleration in agricultural productivity 1997-98 onwards. Nevertheless, continuous supply of agricultural commodities, especially staples like rice, wheat and pulses enabled to achieve the food security in the country. While Green Revolution revolutionised the food production, it also strengthened and expanded the National Agricultural Research System (NARS). Many research institutes, All India Coordinated Research Projects (AICRPs) and State Agricultural Universities were initiated and made operation under the ambit of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). The research institutes on rice, jute and sugarcane, established in the pre-independent India, were brought under the purview of ICAR in 1966. The organized research on other crops was carried out by the establishment of AICRPs in 1967. For achieving sustained agricultural growth of 4%, India further expanded NARS in 1977-93 and Directorate and National Research Centres on some selected crops were established to give research impetus. Subsequently, directorates on different crop groups such as pulses and oilseeds, were upgraded to the Institute level to foster multidisciplinary research. Currently, the crop-based research is being carried out by 28 national institutes including one deemed-to-be-university, 3 bureaus, 2 project directorates, 1 national research centre, 22 AICRPs and 10 All India Network Projects (AINP).
