 It shows a yield advantage of 882-1,110 kg/ha in rabi and 495-665 kg/ha in kharif Promising rice-resistant lines Breeding lines Resistance against MTU 1036, MTU 1037, MTU 1042, Planthoppers MTU 1048; INRC Nos. 202, 3524, 3526 JGL 1851, JGL 2813, JGL 3856, JGL 3858, Different gall-midge biotypes RGL 8896, RYT 2663; INRC Nos. 1531, 1590 IET Nos. 15579, 15581, 16251, 16270, 16362, Blast 16364, 16783, 16848 (among inbreds), 16439, 16440, 16442 (among hybrids) and INRC Nos. 3552, 17425, 17426, 17427, 17450, 17453, 17458, 17519, 17530, 17578, 17587 and 17604 IET Nos. 16403, 16307, 15588, 16262; Bacterial leaf blight INRC 17460 DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 18 Chemical Control New fungicide formulation Baan 75 WP has been found most effective against blast and Sheathmar and Rhizocin fungicides against sheath blight. Fresh leaf extract of Polygonum hydropiper, at 50 g of leaf in one litre of water emulsified with 5 ml of teepol, controlled brown planthopper infestation and resulted in 66.7% mortality of caseworm in fields. Integrated use of resistant varieties and fungicidal application was most effective against blast, and resistant varieties and judicious use of nitrogenous fertilizers was most effective against bacterial blight. Ufra nematode was observed in the endosperm and germ portion of seeds of Vijetha, indicating possibility of seed as the carrier of the nematode. WHEAT Crop Improvement Winter × Spring Wheat Hybridization With the understanding that introgression of winter wheats may bring in better quality- and yield-contributing genes in spring wheats, a collaborative project was started. In this, 10 winter wheats, KAVKAZ, AGENT, BLUEBOY, HOBBIT, HUSTLER, AGATHA, ARTHUR, AUBURN, BEZOSTAYA and MARTINVASAK 10, selected from the International Winter Wheat Nursery, were crossed with PBW 343, UP 2338, Raj 3765, WH 542 and HD 2687. During 2000-01, 35 F2 bulks have been selected for distribution to Palampur, Pantnagar, Delhi, Kanpur, Varanasi and Vijapur. Hybrid Wheat Research Among 41 different molecules synthesized, 5 chemical hybridizing agent products have produced acceptable level of male sterility at the appropriate doses. Among the 49 wheat entries evaluated over 3 locations in the north-western plains zone, 2 hybrids viz. HM 99168 and HM 9997 have exhibited more than 12% heterosis over the best check PBW 343. Marker-assisted Selection A marker-aided selection approach, utilizing PCR-based markers linked to the quality traits and disease resistance genes, is being executed at the Directorate of Wheat Research. So far worldwide 40 or more disease resistant genes in wheat have been tagged; of which Lr 9, Lr 10, Lr 24, Lr 25, Lr 28, Lr 29, Lr 34, Lr 35, Lr 37, Lr 39, Yr 15, Yr 17 and Sr 39 are the important ones. Germplasm Collection Total of 189 accessions have been collected from Assam, Madhya Pradesh and Uttaranchal hills. These include huskless (Uua), 2R, 6R, barley and old Lal mishri, Katha, Methi local.
