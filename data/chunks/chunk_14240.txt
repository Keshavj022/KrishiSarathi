 The present study employs one such bottom-up approach - CRIDA (Climate Risk Informed Decision Analysis), which is a combi­ nation of the decision scaling (Brown et al., 2012; García et al., 2014) and adaptation pathways (Hassnoot et al., 2013), for agricultural adaptation planning. CRIDA (Mendoza et al., 2018) has been success­ fully applied to develop adaptation plans in water supply, flood reduc­ tion, hydropower, and other sectors (G´omez-Due˜nas et al., 2018; Gilroy and Jeuken, 2018; Mendoza et al., 2018). The method is a combination of the Decision Tree Framework of World Bank (Ray and Brown, 2015) and the Adaptation Pathways method (Haasnoot et al. 2013). The CRIDA approach is applied to assess agricultural vulnerability in the Lower Bhavani irrigation project (LBIP) in Tamil Nadu, India. Based on the literature and to the best of knowledge of the authors, this is prob­ ably the first study in which such a bottom-up approach is applied exclusively in the agricultural sector. Verbist et al. (2020) considers agriculture as one of the water use sectors, in their application of CRIDA approach for the analysis of water security in Limari river basin. The present study considers not only the supply–demand gap in agriculture, but also productivity, which is of concern to the farmers. The published literature on agricultural adaptation measures mostly describes the top-down approach in adaptation planning (Boonwichai et al., 2019; Gummadi et al., 2020; Shuai and Binlei, 2021; Subba Rao et al., 2022; Yasin et al., 2022). However, since agriculture sector requires local level A.G. Kamalamma et al. Climate Services 30 (2023) 100358 3 adaptation measures, it is important to understand the variables that matter to the agricultural system. Agriculture is impacted by both climate change as well as seasonal variability of precipitation and hence requires both short term as well as long term adaptation measures that demands robust adaptation. Since many actors are involved in agricul­ ture production and adaptation needs to be responsive to their objec­ tives, flexible adaptation is needed. The above-mentioned components which are of significance to agriculture sector adaptation is included in this paper. Bhavani river basin in South India is a closed basin (Lannerstad, 2008), with most of its water resources allocated for various uses. Water is being transferred to for drinking and industrial uses in Coimbatore and Tirupur districts, outside the basin. Agriculture remains a main liveli­ hood option for rural population. More than 50 % of the land area in the basin is under paddy cultivation, which is high water demanding (Lakshmanan et al., 2011). Between 1990 and 2005, the inflow to the Bhavanisagar reservoir has also decreased from 2500 Mm3 to around 1500 Mm3 (Lannerstad and Molden, 2009). An earlier study for the Bhavani Basin projects rainfall and temperature to increase in the future (Bhuvaneswari et al., 2013).
