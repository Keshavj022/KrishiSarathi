 The mixture as describe in ITK was applied twice daily for 7-10 days and clinical observations were made for 4 weeks. The relief in pain and shoulder swelling was seen at 1 week. Complete rest was given to the animal and no draught work was assigned during the period of treatment. Method used: Matrix was developed (score sheet) for assessing the performance of ITK and the mean scores were taken on a scoring pattern of 0-4 scale. For shoulder swelling Intervals of observation after commencement of treatment: (i) Day 7 Items of observations: Swelling:Swelling status was observed and  VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Fig. 1. Uneven weight bearing and friction shoulder swelling in bullocks graded as: 0=no swelling; 1=mild swelling; 2=moderate swelling; and 3=severe swelling. Pain: Pain by pressing at the site was observed and graded as: 0=no pain; 1=mild pain; 2=moderate pain; and 3=severe pain. Side effects: If any was observed after 7, 14, 21 and 30 days of treatment imposition (ii) Day 14 Items of observation: same as for day 7 (iii) Day 21 Items of observation: same as for day 7 (iv) Day 30 Items of observation: Same as for day 7 For joints and limb swelling Intervals of observation after commencement of Treatment: (i) Day 7 Items of observation: Swelling: Swelling status was observed and Score sheet Parameter Intervals of Observation 0 Day 7 Day 14 Day 21 Day 30 Day Swelling (scores) Pain (scores) Fig. 2.

Weight bearing in motion: Weight bearing while walking was assessed as: 1=supports the limb on the ground and put less weight; 2 =moderate weight bearing and apparently lame; 3=full weight bearing but apparently lame; and 4=full weight bearing and no lameness. Side effects: These were observed after 9, 14, 21 and 30 days of treatment imposition.
