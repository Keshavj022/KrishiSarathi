3 cm); Safed Musli with high root weight and high saponin; Solanum viarum with prickleless plant type and high alkaloids. Total trait based germplasm thus registered is 1,528 now. DNA fingerprinting: A database to identify rice varieties/germplasm has been developed using 729 diverse rice varieties with 35 SNP and 36 SSR markers for identification of an unknown sample by comparing its profile (SNP and SSR) with the database (http:// Plant germplasm registered by PGRC Crop National Id INGR No Trait for which registered Rice IC0619319 19001 Tolerant to alkalinity stresses up to pH 9.9 and salinity stress, long slender grain.

Rice IC0121865 19037 Resistance to blast disease. Rice IC0199562 19038 Resistance to blast disease. Rice IC0632074 19039 Mutant NH 219 gives higher yield than Nagina 22 in normal and high temperature conditions. Dark green leaves, drought tolerant. Seed hull dark and apiculus black. Rice - 19040 Mutant NH 162 is drought tolerant, gives higher yield than Nagina 22 in normal, drought and aerobic conditions. It is functionally stay green-with dark green leaves, drought tolerant, higher yielder in aerobic condition. Seed hull dark and seed type is slender. Rice IC0632075 19041 Novel donor for resistance to Brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens in rice and possesses high resistance at vegetative and reproductive stages. Present in the elite genetic background of popular commercial variety Swarna. Wheat IC0536365 19007 Resistant to all prevailing stem, leaf and stripe rust pathotypes of India due to the synergistic combination of minor and major rust resistance genes. Presence of leaf tip necrosis (LTN), a phenotypic marker for the presence of minor/APR genes. Wheat EC574482 19008 Resistant to the entire prevailing stem, leaf and stripe rust pathotypes of India due to the synergistic combination of minor and major rust resistance genes. Presence of leaf tip necrosis (LTN), a phenotypic marker for the presence of minor/APR genes. Wheat IC0628570 19009 Resistant to stripe rusts with additional resistance to Karnal bunt and powdery mildew.
