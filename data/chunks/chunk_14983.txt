 Firstly, the total health expenditure2 (total family expenditure on health of the female members of the households during last one year); secondly, the total education expenditure (total family expenditure on education of the female members of the households during last one year); and thirdly the total income (income from primary occupation+ income from secondary occupation by the female members of the households). To calculate the dimension indices (DI) of health, education, and income, minimum and maximum values/goalposts are chosen, given in Table 3. The dimension indices are calculated as: Dimension Index = Actual value −Minimum value Maximum value −Minimum value Source: Authors’ construction from primary data.
