 Flowering in Kashi Kale-1 Contributions from ICAR-IIVR, Varanasi: Given here. “CMS” A-line and B-line in tropical carrot (IC570071, fertile CR-27F); INGR-10110: This is the first report in tropical carrot, which is very useful in development of hybrids. VRCAR-214 (INGR22160, Male sterile line of Red carrot): It is a petalod-CMS line of red carrot with better heterotic potential for root yield, lycopene content and uniformity. The economic traits of VRCAR-214 are as root length of 22.1 cm, root weight of 118.7 g, shoulder diameter of 3.65 cm, lycopene content of 7.45 mg/100 g FW, beta-carotene content of 3.41 mg/100 g FW, TSS of 7.45 °Brix, and root yield potential of 325 q/ha. VRCAR-214 and its maintainer are ideally synchronous in flowering/pollination activities. Registered as Unique Germplasm by Plant Germplasm Registration Committee (PGRC), ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi on 8th December 2022. VRCAR-252 (INGR22088, Male sterile line of Black carrot): It is a petalod-CMS line of black carrot with better heterotic potential for root yield and uniformity. The roots are excellent source of plant derived anthocyanins (278 mg/100 g FW) and phenolics (323 mg GAE/100 g FW); having better anthocyanin yield potential (67 kg/ ha); and greater anti-oxidative ability (FRAP value of 47 μmol TE/g FW), i.e. 28-times higher than red/orange/ yellow carrots. VRCAR-252 and its maintainer are ideally synchronous in flowering/pollination activities. Registered as Unique Germplasm by Plant Germplasm Registration Committee (PGRC), ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi on 8th July 2022.
