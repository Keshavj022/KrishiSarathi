 Services offered by the Technical staff help in planning and coordinating the management aspect of research which in turn help in meeting the goals and improve productivity of the research organization. The training programmes are intended to build the capacity of Technical staff through appropriate modes. Specialized training programmes for the Technical staff were tremendously lacking in the system and they had very limited opportunity of capacity building. Therefore, for the first time, 46 New Specialized Training Programmes were organized based on identified Training Needs by 17 leading ICAR-Institutes during 2016-18 (Table 3). In these programmes, so far 1228 Technical staffs (1172 ICAR employees + 56 Non-ICAR employees) participated, out of which about 36.6% Technical staff got first time opportunity after joining ICAR service.
