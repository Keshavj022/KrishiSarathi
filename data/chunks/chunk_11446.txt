 In irrigated situation high yielding short duration paddy variety like Satabdi, WGL 20471, Rajendra Bhagabati, Shreya etc. can be grown to obtain maximum yield In saline affected soil Mohan (CSR-4), CSR-36, 43 and 46, Gosaba-5 & 6 can be grown to get maximum yield and net return To reduce soil salinity and to improve soil health apply 7-8 t/ha decomposed cowdung/FYM or 1.5-2.0 t/ha vermicompost during land preparation or practice green manuring Transplanting should be done by following skip row method to avoid BPH pest load ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 206 Apply soil test based balanced fertilizers. For judicious use of nitrogenous fertilizer, follow Leaf Colour Chart (LCC). For better yield, apply 15-20 kg of zinc sulphate monohydrate (33%) per hectare during puddling Maize (Rabi) Different varieties like, P 3396, Deccan 103, Deccan 105, P 3546, P 3522, Rajkumar, All-Rounder, 900 M Gold. PAC-740 etc. may be used. Optimum plant population (7 plants sq mt-1) should be maintained following planting geometry of 60 cm × 30 cm. Follow ridge and furrow method of sowing as it is better than conventional method (flat sowing), particularly in medium lands with moderate salinity. Apply 5-ton FYM per ha at 10 days prior to sowing. Further, apply 174 kg urea, 375 kg SSP, 120 kg MOP and 25 kg ZnSO4 (Zinc Sulphate) ha-1 as basal. Top-dressing of urea in two splits viz. 130 kg at knee-high stage and 130 kg at pre-tasselling stage should be done. Lentil Sowing of lentil should be completed between 1st and 30th November for sole cropping. Lentil can be cultivated as relay crop and seeds are to be broadcasted at least 7-10 days before harvest of kharif paddy. Suitable varieties like WBL-77 (Moitree), L-4717 (Pusa Ageti), KLS-09-3, PL-8, IPL- 316 etc. should be sown @ 30 kg seed ha-1 For sole cropping, apply only 250 kg of SSP and 35 kg of MOP at the time of final land preparation (basal). If required, a light irrigation can be given during pre-flowering stage. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 207 Two foliar sprays of boron @ 0.2% (before and after flowering) can be effective. Sprays either DAP or urea @ 2% during flowering stage is effective in maintaining plant vigour. Rapeseed-Mustard Sowing of mustard should be completed within 3rd week of October to second week of November. Varieties like Binoy, Varuna, Pusa Bold, Kranti, Bhagirathi, PM- 2-3, PM-99-125, PM-5, PM-28, PM-30, YSH-0401, NRCHB-101, TBM-204 etc. are suitable. For utera / paira cropping, seeds of mustard (cv. B-9, TBM 143 etc.) can be sown at least 10-12 days prior to harvesting of preceding kharif paddy. Treat the seeds with Carbendazim (Bavistin) 50 WP (2 g kg-1 seed) at least 4 hours before sowing. Organic seed treatment with Trichoderma viridae @ 5 g kg-1 seed can be effective. Crop under line sowing method should be maintained with proper planting geometry (20-25 cm × 10 cm). Apply 3-ton FYM ha-1 at 10 days prior to sowing. Further, apply 43.
