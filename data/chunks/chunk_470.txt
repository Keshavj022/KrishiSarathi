 Millets are known for their resilience and ability to grow in harsh environments with minimal water and resources, making them ideal for sustainable food systems. They are hardy crops that require less water and can thrive in areas with poor soil fertility. This resilience makes millets an excellent choice for regions facing water scarcity or those prone to droughts and climate change effects. Millets for instance pearl millet and sorghum have deep root systems which allow them to access moisture from deeper soil layers, making them more drought- resistant compared to other major cereal crops like rice and wheat. This not only conserves precious water resources but also reduces the vulnerability of farming systems to erratic rainfall patterns and prolonged dry spells. Some millet varieties have shorter growing seasons, allowing them to mature quickly. This adaptability is crucial in regions with unpredictable weather patterns and can help farmers mitigate the risks associated with late or erratic rainfall. Furthermore, millets have proven their resilience in hot and arid conditions. They can withstand high temperatures, making them a viable option for Indian Farming 34 October 2023 regions experiencing heatwaves and extended periods of extreme heat. They contribute to crop diversity, which is essential for building resilient agricultural systems. A diverse array of crops, including millets, provides a buffer against crop failures caused by climate- related factors, pests, and diseases. An important trait millet crops posses is that these can contribute to carbon sequestration in the soil, helping mitigate the impacts of climate change. Their ability to grow in various soil types and conditions allows for sustainable farming practices that promote soil health and carbon storage. Additionally, compared to rice cultivation, which is associated with significant methane emissions, millet farming generally produces fewer greenhouse gases. This aligns with efforts to reduce the agricultural sector’s contribution to climate change. With rising worries about lifestyle illnesses and a ‘refined’ eating culture, modern consumers are slowly but steadily turning to nutrient-rich millets (Fig. 1) as a viable alternative to wheat and rice. With the COVID-19, momentum accelerated, and both urban and rural customers prefer millets to improve their nutrition and immunity. Firstly, in a time of heightened health consciousness and an emphasis on immunity- boosting foods, millets stood out as a nutritionally robust choice. These ancient grains are densely packed with vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre, making them a prime candidate for enhancing overall health and bolstering the immune system. As the world grappled with the virus, having a fortified immune response became paramount, and many individuals turned to nutrient-rich foods like millets to provide that extra layer of defense against infections.
