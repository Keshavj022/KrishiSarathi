These guidelines have now been updated and revised by incorporating the latest changes over time. I. Self-pollinated crops A. Stages of Testing A three-tier system of multilocation evaluation spread over a minimum period of three years*, involving following stages is a must for release of a variety or a hybrid. (i) First year : Initial Varietal Trial (IVT) (ii) Second year : Advanced Varietal Trial I (AVT-I) (iii) Third year : Advanced Varietal Trial II (AVT-II) B. Mode of Induction of Test Entries (i) Test entries shall be included in the coordinated trials on the basis of the data generated in pre- coordinated testing (station and other trials). The entries to be nominated must have undergone critical evaluation/screening in the station/regional trials, which are conducted by the sponsoring breeder/institution/organization/company.
