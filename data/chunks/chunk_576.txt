 Agricultural Technology Management Agency, Shimla provided data of farmers natural farming, from which 30 farmers from each of the three blocks of Jubbal, Kotkhai, and Choupal in the Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh were selected by purposeful sampling. The possible apple-based crop combinations adopted by farmers are depicted in Table 1. Socio-economic analysis was performed between conventional and natural farming systems under different intercrops. The study inferred a significant output with high net returns in area under natural and conventional farming systems. The highest net return in kharif was observed in the crop combination of apple + pulses + vegetables (`17,251) for the non-bearing area, for the initial fruiting year crop it was (`2,04,352), for the main fruiting trees area (`5,83,918), for above 30 years year crop (`5,76,293). In the rabi, apple+ pea was high with `46,735.2 in the non-bearing period, `51,276.8 in initial fruiting years, `22,042.2 in main fruiting years, and `32,664.8 for above 30 years Table 1.

Low net returns have been observed in conventional farming as compared to natural farming. Economic implications The adoption of natural farming practices can have potential economic benefits for farmers. The practice can be a viable approach to reduce input costs through the maximum use of locally available resources to enhance farm net profits substantially. The sustainable practices utilized in natural farming enhance crop productivity and quality, leading to better market prices for organic and eco-friendly produce. Furthermore, natural farming encourages crop diversification, allowing farmers to spread their income sources and reduce their reliance on a single crop. This diversification strategy offers a buffer against crop failures, providing farmers with a more stable income.
