 l Prediction equations of important pests and diseases in crops, viz cotton, rice, pigeonpea, groundnut, sugarcane and mustard have been developed. DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 84 CROP PRODUCTION Cropping Systems Efficient cropping systems for different agro-ecozones have been identified. Under arid ecosystem; at Hisar, cotton-wheat (Rs 69,417/ha) followed by pearlmillet- potato-greengram (Rs 67,027/ha) and at S.K. Nagar, castor-castor-greengram (Rs 80,707/ha) followed by pearlmillet-fennel-cowpea (Rs 74,260/ha) were identified as more remunerative systems. Under semi-arid ecosystem; at Kanpur, maize-potato-sunflower (Rs 58,892/ha) followed by maize-potato-wheat (Rs 81,039/ha), at Bichpuri, dhaincha (green manure)-potato-sunflower (Rs 80,719/ ha) followed by pearlmillet-wheat-greengram (Rs 45,822/ha), at Rudrur, soybean- safflower (Rs 43,028/ha), at Junagadh, groundnut-onion-fallow (Rs 136,694/ha) followed by pearlmillet-onion-cowpea (Rs 118,632/ha), at Parbhani, soybean-onion (Rs 116,621/ha) followed by cotton-cotton-groundnut (Rs 55,110/ha) and at Kathalegere, hybrid cotton-hybrid cotton-groundnut (Rs 92,234/ha) followed by hybrid cotton-cotton-sunflower (Rs 81,213/ha) were more remunerative cropping systems. Under sub-humid ecosystem; at Palampur, rice-vegetable pea-potato (Rs 46,676/ha), at Sabour, berseem (F) -maize + cowpea (F) (Rs 141,081/ha) followed by rice-potato-sunflower (Rs 95,651/ha), at Pantnagar, rice-wheat- greengram (Rs 71,892/ha) followed by rice-vegetable-rice (Rs 70,312/ha), at Varanasi, rice-wheat-cowpea (F) (Rs 70,867/ha) followed by rice-potato-greengram (Rs 70,555/ha), at Chiplima, rice-groundnut-sesamum (Rs 53,182/ha) and at Jabalpur soybean-wheat (Rs 47,863/ha) were found more suitable in terms of economic return. Under humid ecosystem; at Jorhat, rice-brinjal (Rs 78,789/ha) and at Kalyani, rice- cabbage-rice (Rs 100,923/ha) were identified more remunerative. Under coastal ecosystem; at Bhubaneswar, rice-maize (cob) -cowpea (Rs 94,891/ha) followed by rice–maize (cob) -greengram (Rs 68,325/ha), at Navsari rice-sorghum (F) -groundnut (Rs 51,940/ha) followed by rice-wheat-greengram (Rs 50,396/ha), at Karjat, rice- maize (F) (Rs 86,171/ha) followed by rice-groundnut (Rs 57,420/ha) and at Thanjavur, rice-rice-pigeonpea (Rs 60,899/ha) followed by rice-rice-sesamum (Rs 54,993/ha) were noted most promising systems. Direct Seeded Rice in Rice-Wheat System is More Remunerative than Transplanted Studies conducted at the PDCSR, Modipuram, indicated that various crop establishment methods of rice, viz. direct seeding (dry), direct seeding (puddled) and transplanting produced almost similar grain yield of rice (4.43–4.91 tonnes/ ha). Transplanting of rice resulted in significantly lower yield of succeeding wheat (3.5 tonnes/ha) as compared to direct seeded rice with either puddled or unpuddled conditions (4.25–4.72 tonnes/ha).
