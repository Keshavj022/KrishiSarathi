 Fish Breeding and rearing of ornamental shrimps and fishes: Marine ornamental shrimps, Ancylocaris brevicarpalis, Gnathophyllum americanum and Stenopus hispidus collected from the Lakshadweep Islands were Stenopus hispidus Gnathophyllum americanum Dascyllus carneus Ancylocaris brevicarpalis Thor hainanensis Lysmata amboinensis Three-tier seabass farming Three-tier seabass farming in mangrove region of Sindhudurg by self-help groups (SHGs) of Maharashtra was undertaken. Six nurseries, a pre-grow-out and 33 grow-out cages were installed. SHGs generated total revenue of ` 3.16 lakh through seabass nursery and pre grow-out rearing. Up to grow-out farming (400–500 g) generated a total revenue of ` 12 lakh. Open water cages in brackishwater at Talashil village, Sindhudurg, Maharashtra LIVESTOCK IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 65 bred and larval rearing and juvenile production is in progress. Broodstock development is in progress for Thor hainanensis and Lysmata amboinensis, the ornamental shrimp species first time reported from Indian waters. Achieved successful breeding and larval rearing of marine ornamental fish, Cloudy Damsel (Dascyllus carneus) from wild-caught broodstock. Wild broodstock took four months to spawn and laid 6,500–10,500 eggs/ spawning. Hatching rate ranged from 90.6 to 98.81%. Newly hatched larvae (1.95±0.14 mm in total length) were reared using live feed, copepod Parvocalanus crassirostris. Yolk was completely absorbed in 72 h of hatching. Preflexion stage was from 4 to 10 dph (day post hatching), flexion stage from 11 to 12 dph and postflexion stage from 13–15 dph. Larvae settled from planktonic stage in 22–23 days and all the larvae metamorphosed into juveniles by 50 dph. Coldwater ornamental fish species Garra gotyla and Garra annandalei were successfully bred. G. gotyla achieved 70–75% fertilization rate and 85–90% hatching rate. The complete embryonic development took 1,420 min and emerging sac fry were 3 mm in total length. In three months they attained total length of about 38 mm. G. annandalei was found to be single spawner having fecundity of around 610–700 eggs/fish (weight 14–16 g) with egg size of 1,150–1,186.91 μm. Fertilization rate was 60% and hatching rate 90%. Captive breeding of catfishes: Two endemic, rare and threatened catfish species from Western Ghats, viz. Hemibagrus punctatus and Clarias dussumieri were captive bred with wild collected broodstock from River Cauvery. Hemibagrus punctatus had fecundity of about 3,000 eggs/female. Fertilization and hatching rates were 80%. In Clarias dussumieri F1 progeny were matured in captivity and bred again and F2 generation is being raised in captivity.
