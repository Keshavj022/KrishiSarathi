 Over 80% of the chickpea area in Andhra Pradesh is now cultivated with the short-duration improved cultivars JG 11 and KAK 2, which were developed through a partnership between ICRISAT and the Indian NARS. Andhra Pradesh was once considered to be a low yielding state for chickpea because of its warm, short-season environment, but it now has the highest yield levels in India. Chickpea performance in Andhra Pradesh results into 9-fold increase in production (95,000 to 884,000 tons), 5-fold increase in area (102,000 to 602,000 ha) and 2.4-fold increase in yield levels (583 to 1,407 kg per ha). Odisha released its first improved pigeonpea cultivar, ICPH 3762, in the name of Goddess Pārbati in March 2015. ICPH 3762 recorded 125% increase in yield over local types. This hybrid also possesses complete resistance against wilt and sterility mosaic diseases. Three new varieties were released in Telangana in 2015: (a) ICPH 2740 – released under the name Mannem Konda Kandi – is the first pigeonpea hybrid for the state of Telangana. The hybrid possess resistance to wilt and sterility mosaic diseases and is suitable for deep black soils of the state. With a yield potential of 3.5 tons per ha it registered a 40% yield increase over the local cultivars. (b) ICPL 14003 (PRG 176) was released under the name Ujwala. The variety has yield potential of 2.5 tons per ha and matures in 130 days. It is resistant to terminal drought. (c) ICPL 332 WR (TDRG 4) was released by the name Hanuma. This variety has a yield potential of 3 tons per ha and is resistant to wilt and tolerant to Helicoverpa. HHB 67, an early maturing (62–65 days from sowing to harvest) pearl millet hybrid was developed by ICRISAT in collaboration with the Indian NARS. At the peak of its adoption in 2002, HHB 67 was grown on about 774,000 ha. By 2011, HHB 67 Improved had spread to 875,000 ha, with Rajasthan accounting for 768,000 ha (16% of the state’s total pearl millet area) and Haryana accounting for 107,000 ha (21% of the state’s pearl millet area). It results into $13.5 million net additional benefits compared to local land race, $1,460 per ha increased net income from hybrid seed production and $6.4 million total net benefit from hybrid seed production. ICAR-CGIAR Agricultural Cooperation 38 Furthermore, these hybrids have facilitated the cultivation of winter season rotational crops such as mustard, wheat and chickpea, thus doubling cropping intensity and substantially increasing farm household incomes compared to those obtained previously by growing pearl millet landraces. To date, more than 1.4 million samples of nearly 100,600 germplasm accessions have been shared with collaborators in 145 countries. NARS partners have released more than 800 varieties in 79 countries utilizing germplasm and breeding lines from ICRISAT. Under the Bhoochetana project being implemented in Karnataka, 3.1 million farmers have benefited, 7.
