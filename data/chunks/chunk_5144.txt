 On initial experimentation, both types of extract were tested at lower concentration, viz. 2 mg, 1 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.25 mg per disc. The in vitro results revealed that only in ether extract the concentration of 2 mg and 1 mg had inhibition zone of 13 mm and 12 mm respectively. In second phase, antibiogram profile study was conducted on alcohol and ether extract of kala jeera along with several other antibiotics. For this study Mueller Hinton (MH) medium was used with slight modifications. Pasteurella multocida P52 strain was used. Sterile discs were adsorbed with 32 mg, 16 mg, 8 mg, 4 mg and 2 mg of methanol and ether extract of kala jeera. One disc for each methanol and ether was prepared separately as a control. The MH plates, streaked with P. multocida and all those discs that were adsorbed with different concentrations of kala jeera extract and control disc were placed over media. Plates were kept at 37°C for 14 hr incubation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study The results of matrix ranking are given in Table 2. This ITK is in practice in opinion of 55% farmers, infrequently used in 19% and not in practice in opinion of 26%. Local practitioners and animal owners use only this ITK, however, it is not practised by trained pharmacists and qualified veterinary officers. The respondent's opinion regarding the three different treatments on efficacy had no difference. Treatment efficacy with veterinary drugs (VD), and veterinary drugs and kala jeera (VD+KJ) was found significantly better than local application of kala jeera (KJ) alone. Efficacy between veterinary drugs (VD), veterinary drugs + kala jeera (VD+KJ) was not significantly different. In all cases the treatment was effective only in early stage of the disease. Kala jeera application was cheaper as compared to veterinary drugs. Application convenience of kala jeera was better than veterinary drugs. Table 2.

VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Fig. 1. Seeds of kala jeera Accessibility and availability of kala jeera was easier than of veterinary drugs. Treatment with veterinary drugs, and veterinary drugs and kala jeera was sustainable than with kala jeera alone. In the in-vitro study, the zone of inhibition was recorded, as given in Table 3. Except sulphadizine and oxytetracycline, all Table 3.
