in 40 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Natural Resource Management • A masonry check dam across Banganala waterway at village Khuj of Banganala watershed in Rewa region, the yield of soybean has risen from 8 to 12 q/ha. The yield of rice has also been raised from 6.5 to 10 q/ha. Underground water table raised in surrounding wells. • Conservation tillage (summer ploughing) for in‐situ moisture conservation in inceptisols of Eastern Uttar Pradesh was adopted in 80% of the area. Farm Machinery • Use of seed‐cum‐fertilizer drill (Rakh Dhiansar): Adopted in 35 to 40 % of the area under rainfed wheat Jammu and Kathua districts. • Two bowl seed drill was widely adopted in 9‐10 thousand ha area of Solapur, Ahmednagar and Pune districts. • Cycle hoe as a new economic implement for hoeing was adopted in Sarole, Pokharapur, Konheri of Mohol tahasil, Dist. Solapur. • Mechanization of seeding operation for desired stand and enhanced system productivity for rainfed area of the Varanasi region and adopted in 25% cultivated area. With promotion of custom hiring service use of mechanical system is found to make its impact in the region. • Suitability of (Indore): Modified NRCS seed drill for increasing productivity in soybean was given on custom hiring to large number of farmers and used in more than 45 ha area for planting of bold seeded kabuli chickpea. • An improved tillage implement for better moisture conservation and higher productivity of Chickpea was adopted in 75‐80% area in Hisar region. Alternate Land Use Systems • About 10–15 percent of farmers in Kandi areas of Jammu region have adopted agri‐horti and agro‐forestry systems. • Adoption of technologies in ORP and diffused in surrounding villages • Anantapur (170 farmers in 2 villages): Intercropping with groundnut and pigeonpea (11: 1/15:1; Use of small and shriveled seeds for sowing groundnut; Improved variety Vemana groundnut; Soil test‐based fertilizer application in groundnut; Tractor drawn mechanical seed drill. • Arjia (130 farmers in one village): Summer tillage in Maize; Ridging after 30 DAS in maize; Maize (Navjot), groundnut (JL‐24, TAG‐24), Sesame (RT‐46), blackgram (RPU‐38), greengram (K‐851), horsegram (AK‐42; Maize + blackgram (2:2;Grounnut + sesame (6:2;Maize‐black gram rotation for 2 years; Chickpea + mustard (sowing mustard 4 m apart across gram rows. • Ballowal Saunkhri (70 farming families in one village): In‐situ rainwater management through cultivation across the slope; Wheat/chickpea + raya intercropping 10:1;Groundnut (M‐522, M‐548, SG‐99; Green gram (SML‐668; Chickpea (PBG‐1);Raya (RLM‐619;80‐40 NP in maize. • Bangalore (300 farmers in two villages): Finger millet MR‐1, GPU 28 and 26,HR9‐11; Pigeonpea TTB‐7, Hyd 3‐C, BRG‐1 and 2;Fodder crops: African tall, Giant Bajra; Horse gram PHG‐9; Fingermillet + pigeonpea 10:2;Maize + cowpea 3:1 for fodder Pigeonpea + cowpea (1:1); Sowing across the slope; Finger millet + Redgram (8:2or 10:2) + mango; Drumstick on field bunds. www.icar.
