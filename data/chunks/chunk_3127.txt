7 mm and diameter‐3.18 mm is best with maximum fertilizer application rate 45 lph at inlet pressure 0.702 kg/cm2. The developed equipment is mainly suitable for farmers having less land holdings or in green houses/ net houses who want to apply fertilizers/ micro nutrients through drip irrigation system The cost of orifice meter with by‐pass system is around Rs. 300.00 where as the cost of the venturi is Rs. 1048.00 for same purpose of Fertigation 3.5 Low cost screen filter for micro irrigation system Low head drip irrigation system used on small land holding to avoid the clogging of emitters in the system by filtering the irrigation water. Filtering unit is one of the important components of micro irrigation system which prevents clogging of emitters. It is more costly than other components of the system. To reduce the system cost, the efforts has been made to develop the low cost filter especially for smaller area, so that small and marginal farmers can effectively use the low cost micro irrigation system for different crops. The low cost screen filter for a low to medium capacity was developed with back wash flushing system. The PVC pipe of 90 mm and 50 mm diameter were used for fabricating the filter. The PVC pipe of 50 mm diameter used as filtering house and 90 mm diameter PVC pipe used as casing for the filter. The removal efficiency was found to be 36.8 % at sediment concentration of 250 mg/lit where as it was 71.9 % for sediment concentrations of 1000 mg/lit. The removal efficiency for higher sediment concentration was found more than lower sediment concentration. The clean pressure drop across the filter was found 1.2 m. It can be performed better in combination with the sand filter, which improves the filtration efficiency. The Output capacity is 3‐7 m3/hr. The developed filter is cost effective as it reduces the cost of the filter to 35‐40 % compared to the standard screen filter available in the market. A local artisan can easily fabricate the developed filter. This filter is energy efficient and can be effectively used for low head drip irrigation system in smaller area. It costs Rs.782/‐ www.icar.org.in 7 2002 ‐ 2007 All India Coordinated Research Project on Ergonomics and Safety in Agriculture 1.
