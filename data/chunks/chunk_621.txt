 On the other hand, as mustard is highly sensitive to water logging, hence, adequate drainage facility of water should be maintained to avoid ill effects of heavy winter rains. Use water saving techniques Mulching: Organic mulches like rice straw, stubble, etc. at the rate of 10 t/ha should be spread evenly to cover the inter row spaces, this checks the water losses through evaporation and at the same time suppress weeds that are also responsible for water loss. Broad bed furrow (BBF): The most advanced and beneficial technique in current times which not only conserves moisture but also increase yield effectively is BBF. It is designed especially for vertisols (deep black soil) where flat beds of 90–120 cm wide with a V shaped shallow furrow of 30 cm width are laid out with a slope of 0.3–0.5%. BBF is highly effective as it provides drainage during heavy rains and conserves moisture during dry spells (Table 5) Integrated approach for pest management Major pests of mustard in Bundelkhand are mustard aphid, mustard saw fly, painted bug, diamond backmoth, leaf miner, etc., while major diseases are Alternaria blight, white rust, downey mildew, etc. The common control measures that should be adopted to reduce the infestation of pests and incidence of diseases are as follows: • Deep ploughing to expose the soil borne pathogens and hibernating stage of defoliators. Indian Farming 17 July 2023 • Timely sowing of crop to reduce the chances of pest attack and disease incidence. • Adoption of proper drainage to avoid water stagnation in the field. • Destruction of plant debris. • Crop rotation to disturb the cycle of obligate pathogens. Control measures for important insects and diseases Aphids: Aphids are most important insects and generally attack from January to March. Therefore, early sowing of crop is desirable. If the infestation reaches at economic threshold level, i.e. 20% plant infestation and 13–14 aphids/ plant, spray 2% neem oil (20 ml oil + 1 ml liquid soap) at flower stage or 5% neem seed kernel extract (NSKE). Spray bio-agent Verticillium lecanii 1 kg/ha in 5000 l/ha water or use bio-predators like-ladybird beetles as they can feed up to 10–15 Table 5.

Application of 4% NSKE is very effective.
