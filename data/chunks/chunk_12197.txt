 Description of morphological features DUS testing guidelines notified by the PPV&FRA may be followed wherever available. Minimum traits required may be decided by the workshop. 8. Others Information on the available DNA markers (based on the availability) is also needed. Soybean 1. Important characters on which data should be recorded A.
