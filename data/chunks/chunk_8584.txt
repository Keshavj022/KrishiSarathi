68 at the eighth month of lactation, showing that fat percentage increased with the stage of lactation. BUFFALO Evaluation of Bulls under Progeny Testing On basis of the data on 305 days milk yield of daughters, received from various centres, bull number 392 and 896 of the CIRB were ranked as first and third. Superiority over contemporary daughters for the two bulls was 22.8 and 5.5% respectively. The semen of these bulls is being used for nominated matings on the elite animals. Network Project on Buffalo Improvement The test mating from sixth set resulted in 413 inseminations, out of which 165 pregnancies were obtained. Seventh set started from July 2002. MULTIPLICATION OF ELITE GERMPLASM The technique of IVF was assessed for its practicability in buffaloes, and the different steps were standardized using slaughterhouse oocytes. Available knowledge and practical techniques were made available to concerned scientists and teachers through ICAR sponsored Summer School entitled — Application of cryopreservation of germplasm for improving productivity of dairy buffaloes.
