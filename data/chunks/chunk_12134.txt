The degrees awarded by the Universities associated with the ICAR are well-recognized and accepted for higher education globally. Some of the post-graduates also start their own business units including the Agri-clinics and Agro-service Centres. The passed out graduates get employment in various sectors such as 33 per cent in government, 44 per cent in private, 10 per cent in financial, 4 per cent in research and academic and 9 per cent in others (NAIP report-2011). The major shift in the past three decades has been decline in the share of public sector in employment, which could be due to freezing employment in government sector as well as expansion of opportunities in the Private sector.
