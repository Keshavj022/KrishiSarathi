 Phytochemical analysis of shisham leaves: Cold methanolic, hexane and aqueous extracts of shisham leaves were prepared after soaking the powder in these solvents for 24 hr. Phytochemical analysis of these extracts was done for the presence of alkaloids, anthraquinones, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, sterols, reducing sugars, glycosides, resins, triterpenes, proteins and coumarins by the standard methods. Antimicrobial activity assessment: Antimicrobial activity assessment of shisham leaf-powder extracts was assessed against commonly prevalent bacteria of enterobacteriacae using standard methods of agar wells. A concentration of 500 mg /ml extract of shisham leaves powder was prepared in different solvents. An amount of 150 ul/well of the above concentration was used for antimicrobial assessment. Etiological distribution: Faecal examination of 52 calves of various age groups (1 week to 6 months) was done by standard techniques to de- termine the etiological agent (s) associated with the diarrhoea. The faecal samples that were nega- tive for parasitic eggs were subjected to micro- bial investigation and antibiotic sensitivity tests. MASFSU Therapeutic trial: The study was conducted on goats presented to Veterinary College Hospital, Nagpur with a history of diarrhoea or dysentery. These goats were subjected to detailed clinical and parasitological examination and were sub- divided into parasitic and non-parasitic groups. These animals were randomly assigned to two treatments within each broad groups (parasitic and non-parasitic) comprising 6 goats irrespective of their age and sex. Freshly collected shisham leaves were minced in a mixer and the paste was administered orally @ 25 g twice a day to goats suffering from parasitic and non-parasitic diarrhoea. Faecal sample examination: Faecal samples from goats suffering with diarrhoea were collected per-ractal in clean sterile glass vials before treatment and thereafter on day 6 of the treatment. The samples were examined by sedimentation technique immedietly after the collection. Efficacy of treatment: Efficacy of the drugs was evaluated on the basis of eggs per gram faeces (EPG) determined by the modified Stoll's dilution technique on days 0 and 6 post- treatment. Clinical examination: Clinical signs such as dehydration score and faecal consistency were recorded.
