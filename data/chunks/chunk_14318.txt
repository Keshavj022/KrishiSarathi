 Principal component analysis (PCA) and variable selection PCA was employed to analyse arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization percentage, easily extractable and total glomalin related soil protein, soil organic carbon, soil microbial biomass carbon, β-galactosidase activity and water stable aggregates of 1–2 mm as to ascertain their contribution for improving soil quality. The PCA clustered all the observations into 6 principal components (PCs) (Table 6). PC 1 contributed 85.16 % variance with Eigen value of 5.11 and was the only PC with Eigen value of more than 1 in comparison with the other PCs (Table 6). Therefore, PC 1 was regarded as the best PC for further analysis. The weight values for respective PCs was 1 because both variable and cumulative variable percent was 85.16 % for PC 1.

K. Nthebere et al. Heliyon 11 (2025) e41196 8 dependent, the indicators or variables were selected based on PCA and correlation among the soil parameters. These selected variables from PC 1 were total glomalin related soil protein, soil organic carbon, β-galactosidase activity, soil microbial biomass carbon and water stable aggregates of 1–2 mm based on their higher factor loading scores (Table 6). 12.
