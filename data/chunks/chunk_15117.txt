Wadghane and O. Madguni Smart Agricultural Technology 6 (2023) 100369 5 methodology considers a balanced weighting approach for each component, ensuring a holistic evaluation of water availability, access, usage, capacity and environmental impact. Agriculture water poverty index (AWPI) The AWPI covers five areas of water management, namely resources, access, capacity, use, and environment. In addition, each area has been divided into sub-components. The concept of WPI helps to assess the water situation in different places [21,22]. In addition, the index com­ bines various data into a composite indicator that includes physical, social, economic, and environmental dimensions of water availability, access to water, and ability to use water.
