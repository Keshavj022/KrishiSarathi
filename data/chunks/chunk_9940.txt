Impact of ICAR Technologies Varietal improvement and quality breeder seed production are major mandates of ICAR since independence. It has not only increased the productivity but also remained as a carrier of other farm technologies. Farmers’ access to improved quality seeds of superior varieties has increased the productivity (15-20%) and quality of farm produce. More Genome edited mutant of mega rice cv.

In recent times, the traditional breeding methods are being supplemented with modern molecular tools like genome selection and genome editing for accelerated and targeted varietal improvement. Till date, molecular tools are successfully deployed in 74 released varieties of seven crops. The major achievements and impacts of ICAR technologies during the current year are briefly described below: yy Varietal improvement: A total of 389 varieties/ hybrids of 45 crops including cereals (156), oilseeds (58), pulses (69), fibre crops (69), forage crops (19), sugarcane (12) and potential crops (6) were released for commercial cultivation. The released varieties included 35 special trait varieties of crops and 14 Marker Assisted Selection derived varieties (Rice-8, Maize-2, Pearl millet-1, Chickpea-2 and Soybean-1). yy Seed production: About 106,498 quintal breeder seed of 1,399 varieties (56 crops) was produced against the DA&FW breeder seed indents of 84,678 quintal. In addition, 481,473 quintal quality seed of crops and 239.89 lakh planting materials were produced and supplied under various programmes. yy Germplasm collection and conservation: Conserved 8,622 new accessions of orthodox seed species in the National Genebank, cryo-preserved 237 accessions of seeds and pollen genomic resources in Cryo-Genebank, and conserved 272 microbial genetic resources.
