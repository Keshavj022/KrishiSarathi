 Plasma agriculture seeks to provide eco- friendly alternatives to mitigate these negative effects. Improving crop health and productivity is a constant goal in agriculture research. Plasma treatments have shown promise in enhancing seed germination, stimulating plant growth, and controlling diseases, suggesting opportunities to boost crop yields and reduce losses from pests and pathogens. Plasma technology offers an alternative approach to reduce the reliance on pesticides and fertilizers and adopt more sustainable pest and disease control methods. Plasma treatments have been explored for their potential to extend the shelf-life of produce, minimizing losses caused by pathogens and deterioration. Furthermore, plasma technology allows for precise and targeted treatments, aligning with the principles of precision agriculture. By optimizing resource utilization and minimizing waste, plasma agriculture can contribute to more efficient and sustainable farming practices. How does plasma agriculture work? High-energy plasma particles interact with plant cells and tissues when plants are exposed to them, changing the physiology of the plants which may result in higher photosynthesis, enhanced nutrient uptake, and improved plant development. Plasma can also be used to sterilise soil by eliminating unwanted bacteria, fungus, and other microbes that might lead to plant diseases. This can improve crop health and enhance their yield. Crops in stand are exposed to a low-temperature plasma field in plasma agriculture. In plasma agriculture, crops are exposed to low-temperature plasma to achieve several beneficial effects. Unlike high-temperature plasmas, low- temperature plasmas, also known as non-thermal or cold plasmas, offer advantages for agricultural applications. The reasons for subjecting crops to low-temperature plasma include: • Seed treatment: Treating seeds with plasma before planting can enhance germination rates, stimulate seedling growth, and ultimately improve overall crop yield. • Disease control: Low-temperature plasma has been investigated as a potential method for controlling plant pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi. This approach may reduce the reliance on chemical pesticides and promote more sustainable agricultural practices. • Nutrient uptake: Plasma treat- ments can stimulate root devel- opment and improve nutrient absorption in plants, leading to better nutrient uptake from the soil and overall crop health. • Stress tolerance: Exposure to low-temperature plasma has shown promise in enhancing crops’ ability to tolerate various environmental stresses, such as drought, heat, and cold, which is particularly valuable in the context of climate change. • Weed control: Plasma agriculture has explored the use of low- temperature plasma for weed control. Plasma treatments can inhibit weed growth without the need for herbicides, offering a more environmentally friendly approach to weed management.
