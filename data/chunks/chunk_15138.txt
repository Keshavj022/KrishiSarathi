 In Rajanagaram, there were four male participants; in Korukonda, there were six male and two female participants; and in Gandepalli, there were five male participants. However, there was a higher participation of men than women in each group, mainly due to their greater involvement in MI technology operations. These areas were selected due to their significant potential and actual area under Micro-Irrigation (MI), accounting for 72.8%, which is among the highest in the semi-arid states as of 2020. FGD is a qualitative approach that links farmers’ perceptions, socio-economic status, and cultural context to their decision-making process regarding the adoption of water-saving technologies. Farmers often form opinions and interpretations based on their immediate environment and experiential knowledge (Bennett et al., 2017; Nyumba et al., 2018). The FGD interviews were conducted as part of the Water for Sustainable Development (WSD) project, funded by the Ministry of Environment, Japan. Three FGD interviews were carried out in the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh in May–June 2021, guided by an FGD manual designed to cover barriers and facilitating factors influ­ encing the adoption of drip and sprinkler irrigation. The discussions were audio-recorded in local languages and subsequently translated into English, ensuring an accurate representation of participants’ opinions and perceptions while avoiding bias due to linguistic differences. The resulting transcripts were analyzed and categorized into different themes using QSR International’s NVivo 11 qualitative data analysis software. 2.3. Methods 2.3.1. Empirical model In order to select an appropriate econometric model for analyzing the factors influencing the adoption of different MI technologies (drip, sprinkler, and drip & irrigation) by farming households required consideration of the discrete-dichotomous nature of the MI technologies adoption variable. A farming household is either categorized as an “adopter” if they have these MI technologies (drip, sprinkler, or both), or as a “non-adopter” if they do not possess any MI technology. Probit and logit models are commonly employed to estimate technology adoption Table 2 Area covered under semi-arid Indian states.
