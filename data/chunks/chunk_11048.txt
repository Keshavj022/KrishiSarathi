 The use of environmental friendly biofertilizers can cut down the use of chemical fertilizers. Biofetilizers are the products containing living cells of different types of microorganisms that enrich the nutrient quality of soil. Bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria (blue green algae) are considered as the potential candidates to be used as biofertilizers. Most biofertilizers belong to one of the following categories: nitrogen fixing; phosphate, potash and zinc solubilizing and mobilizing, and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria. The Gazette of India in its notification in April, 2014 also made provision for the production of microbial consortium. It is economical to use biofertilizers as they are a cheap source of nutrients when compared to chemical fertilizers. Biofertilizers in addition to different nutrients also provide certain growth promoting substances like hormones, vitamins, and amino acids that improve the plant health and vigour. Keeping pace with the biofertilizer industry, several Institutes of ICAR have developed biofertilizer technologies which have been validated under on-farm or multi-location trials. This compendium “ICAR Technologies: Biofertilizers for Sustainable Crop Production” is an intensive compilation and reflects the great efforts made by the scientists across various institutes to develop the technologies. vi With great pleasure I extend my sincere thanks to Dr. T. Mohapatra, Hon'ble Secretary, Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE) and Director General, ICAR, for insight, guidance and support in preparation of this compendium. I also thank the developers of biofertilizer technologies for their innovations and contributions. My appreciations are due to my colleagues at the Council and ICAR-NBAIM for bringing out this compendium which will help in shaping Indian Agriculture more sustainable. (T.R.
