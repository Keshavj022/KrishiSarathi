 Do you ha'o'e good knowledge of~~. Plant Breeding and Biotechnoto~ - - - - ANNEXURE-Uf-B ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM Dr. I. S. KATAGERI Query # 1: How was the "purification" of Bn-Bt carried out. What is the population of plants used, and over how many generations has the purification taken place? Query # 2: What are the primers used to separate the MON531 and BNLA106 event during the process of "purification"? There has been mention of thousands of peR being done by UAS, Dharwad especially for identifying purified event containing BNBt plants. Information regarding the chronology of experimentation, population size, primers used, results etc. need to be provided. It was possible to Identify BN Bt plants not carrying Mon-531 in Jan, 2010. The plants were identified based on PCR test, by using Mon 531·specific primers. The plants which did not show presence of Man 531 were tested with primers designed for Cry 1 Ac. The plants negative for Man 531 and positive for Cry lAc specific were identified. The detans of PeR test carried out Is mentioned In the table below Vearof No. of plants Man 531 Cry lAc Testing Generation screened + - + - 2009 T. (Standing crop) ) 587 587 0 587 0 2010 T.

Bangalore Genie for BN Bt. Out of 78 plants tested, 25 were homozygous, 24 were heterozygous, and 18 were multicopy Bt. Seeds of only 25 homozygous plants were further used. Rest of them was rejected. Five progenies of multicopy Bt were however sown in 2006-07 but their seed was not used. 50 this old seed was used to screen. Plants negative for Man 531 but positive for crylAc were identified. Respected sir Information for your queries is mentioned here 1. How did Bangalore genie identifY multi-copy Bt plants. Did they perform Southerns11t is difficult to identifY multi-copy plants by PCR, unless they did qPCR analysis using a single copy gene as a reference. They perfonned semi-quantitative PeR using the STR-<lpecific primers. These are the primers which used to give semi-quantitative PCR results reproducibly and They used to do only 25 cycles of PCRs using limited genomic DNA. Also, the windows of errors were huge as any data between 0.8 and 1.2 were considered as single copy and 1.7 to 2.3 were considered 2 copies.AIl conclusions were made based on experiments repeated :uimes. 2. What are the aylAc specific primers that you used? cry 1Ac specific primers for 1kb that were designed Dr Dr.AnandKumar With regards Katageri 50 - - - - - - - - - - Dear Sir Following is the formation Was there a reason for choosing an sTR instead of single copy gene for this analysis?: Sir, we were not sure about the method to be followed at that time. This method was decided by the firm.
