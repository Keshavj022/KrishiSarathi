 Pattern of species distribution and their relative abundance is nearly identical in 45 and 90 days old transgenic and non-transgenic parent rice. Rhizobium rhizogen, Flavobacterium sp IGB-4-14, Herpetosiphon aurantiacus, uncultured Gram positive bacterium, Cellovibrio tontiphilus, uncultured soil bacterium, uncultured Rickettsiales, Flavobacterium fontis and uncultured proteobacterium were found on both rice types. The data revealed potential of potassium phosphite at 200–400 mM as fungicidal and bactericidal compound for use as an agroinput in rice cultivation. Gram pod borer resistant transgenic chickpea and pigeon pea: Characters specific to chickpea (20) genotype and pigeon pea (21) articulated as per PPVFRA Guidelines were evaluated in all the transgenic lines vis-a-vis parental genotype, and no significant deviation was observed. Expression of BT and NPT protein was observed in all positive transgenic lines, however the expression of BT protein dips at flowering stage. Efficacy of the transgenic lines could be correlated with the expression of BT protein and testing based on laboratory assays and in planta assays indicated variable resistance (up to 85% in chickpea and up to 87% in pigeon pea) in the transgenic lines tested, as compared to control. The flanking sequence information of the chickpea event IPCT3 could be identified and was localized in the gene region of chromosome 1 coding for 4-Coumarate: CoA Ligase. Characterization, mapping and transcriptome analysis of chickpea seed: Chickpea germplasms (404) were characterized for total seed protein content, Fe, Zn and -carotene. ICC 13461, ICC 13523, ICC 8397, T39- 1, ICC 5912 and ICC 9553 genotypes showed higher (>27%) seed protein. Zinc and iron ranged from 1.10 – 5.91 mg/100 g and 0.50–8.54 mg/100 g, respectively; and are comparable to some of the best biofortified crops. High yielding chickpea cultivars contained higher seed Effect of potassium phosphite on blast incidence in rice on non-transgenic rice Field view of chickpea germplasm at ICAR-IARI, New Delhi zinc and iron. Heera, H 82-2 and H 214 for Zn; and L 550, KGD 1168, PG 114, JG 74 and ICCV 6 for Fe are the cultivars identified with higher Zinc (>4 mg/100 g) and iron (>6 mg/100 g). Analysis of phytic acid in cultivars with higher mineral contents showed negative correlation with zinc and iron. Seed -carotene ranged from 248.76 μg/100 g (Pusa 72 and ICC 5948) to 538.11 μg/100 g (ICC 5002). Transcriptome analysis for seed protein and zinc using contrasting cultivars identified conserved and novel miRNAs with respect to seed protein content. Large numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified with respect to seed protein and zinc between contrasting genotypes. Validation of conserved miRNAs in two cultivars revealed presence of miR399 and miR398 exclusively in high seed protein content cultivar, i.e. ICC 8397.
