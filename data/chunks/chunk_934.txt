Mrs. Manjulata Mahanta: Successful rice grower Case study of a successful high yielding rice variety adopter Mrs. Manjulata Mohanta aged nearly 53 years, from one of the adopted villages, Tentalpur of Nischintakoili block, Cuttack district of Odisha is a marginal farm woman, owning less than one ha of land, which she used to cultivate kharif paddy in 0.8 ha, primarily for domestic consumption purpose and vegetables in 0.2 ha to sustain family livelihood throughout the year. She was growing paddy by using seeds of local varieties as a traditional practice, from which she barely incurred marginal returns to sustain her livelihood. After the implementation of ICAR-National Agricultural Science Fund (NASF) project in 2019–20, she got an opportunity to transform the traditional rice- farming by cultivating newly released improved high yielding paddy variety CR Dhan-312. As a part of the project beneficiary, she attended the intensive training cum demonstration programmes round the crop cycle, which enabled her to change the traditional rice farming practices with improved package of practices. She was provided with seeds of high yielding rice learning and awareness through capacity building programmes to initiate cultivation of high yielding rice variety itself in the first year of project implementation. During the entire period, she was supported with necessary technical information and technology backstopping. In this process, her net return increased from ₹46,072/ ha during pre-NASF period to ₹1,09,120/ha during post-NASF period with an increase in income by over 137%, i.e. highest among all the rice growing beneficiaries (Table 1). variety, agro-chemicals (pesticides and fungicides) and fertilizers, etc as critical inputs for initial beginning, Paddy-relay pulse cropping: A step towards crop diversification Introduction of rice-pulse cropping system: After harvesting of kharif rice, high yielding black gram (var. PU–31) was introduced in the rice-fallow and rice local pulse system for obtaining additional farm income and maintaining soil health conditions. Additionally, the technology appears to be input inclusive as the sequential crop (black gram) grows in the residual soil moisture without use of fertilizers and other agro-chemicals. An average yield of 2.95 tonnes/ha was recorded in the black gram, variety PU–31, with an increase yield of ~25–30% over previously grown varieties.
