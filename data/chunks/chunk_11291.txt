 yy Medium maturity variety: Pusa Jawahar Hybrid Maize-1, HQPM- 1, HQPM-5, DHM-121, Vivek Makka Hy-51, HM-10, HM-04, Jawahar Makka-216, KMH-3426, NMH-303, NMH-3712, P-3441, BIO-9682, N-21, X-3342, COH-10, COH-10. yy Late maturing variety: HM-11, NMH-731, BISCE-855. yy Jawahar maize-218 released in 2019. Recommended for Madhya Pradesh, medium duration for maturity, seed yellow /orange, flinty and round shape; multi cob nature suitable for baby corn yy The pupa of fall army worm, stemborer and spore of Rhizoctonia solani, Sheath blight causing agent remain in soil. Therefore, summer deep ploughing is most important to minimize inoculum potential. yy Biopriming/Seed treatment with Carbendazim 2g+ lmidachloprid 2g /kg + Trichoderma10g /kg + Azotobactor 2g/ kg seed followed by its germination test is must to get the optimum number of healthy plants in the field. yy The infestation of Fall Army Worm can be minimized up to great level by dry sowing or sowing with onset of monsoon, practicing crop rotation. Alternate maize with other crops that are not attacked by the Fall Army Worm, application of basal dose of nutrients and ridge and furrow method of bed preparation must be concluded by last week of May or first week of June. Paddy yy Use of high yielding variety like Early- Danteswari, JR 206, JR 81, Sahbhagi and MTU 1010. Medium-Kranti and Mahamaya (Bold grain), IR 35, IR 64 (Medium slender grain), Pusa Basmati 1 and 173 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS Pusa sugandha 5(Scented), Late- MTU1001, MTU 7029 (Swarna) and BPT 5204. yy High yielding early hybrid like JRH 5, JRH 19 and Indira Sona. yy Summer ploughing of field, green manuring use dhaincha, sunhemp, urd or moong, seed treatment (organic-Trichoderma viridae, Pseudomonas flueroscense 5-10g/kg or chemical carbendazim 25%+Mancozeb 50% 3g/kg of seed). yy Preparation of nursery for SRI- Well pulverized nursery, having one meter width & length is needed should be prepared in May. During preparation of nursery adequate quantity of well decomposed FYM should be added to nursery. This FYM will facilitate easy and undamaged uprooting of seedling for its transplanting (25xl5 cm). The date of nursery planting may be adjusted at per availability of water and or onset of monsoon. yy Weed management-timely manual weeding should be done if labour is available, or use of pre- emergence herbicides like pretilachlor 500ml/acre or pyrazosulphuran 80gm/acre and for post emergence bispyribac sodium 100ml/ acre. yy For best plant protection measure timely contact to KVKs scientist of the district. Pigeon pea yy Use of high yielding varieties like Rajiv Lochan, ICPL-87, Asha, TJT-501and Rajeshwari. yy For frost prone area, preference should be given to early to medium maturing variety ICPL -87 and TJT-501. yy Seed treatment should be done with fungicide vitavax power 2g/kg seed and biofertilizer PSB + Rhizobium + Trichoderma10 g/kg seed.
