 It is estimated that 25-30% of fruits and vegetables produced are wasted due to improper sorting, grading, sizing, storage, and transportation methods. To address the significant post-harvest losses caused by improper handling, sorting, grading, and storage, the establishment of a farm-level packhouse is essential. A packhouse provides several advantages for managing fresh fruits and vegetables at the farm level. It reduces post-harvest losses and adds value to produce by completing essential processing tasks like cleaning, sorting, and packaging, which improves the market value, extends shelf-life, and preserves nutritional quality. Packhouses also enable continuous operations like ripening and waxing, helping farmers meet export standards and food safety requirements. Additionally, they streamline logistics by ensuring produce is properly prepared for transport, minimizing damage during shipment. The controlled environment in a packhouse reduces contamination risks, enhancing consumer health and satisfaction. Design of farm-level packhouse A packhouse serves as a facility where fresh fruits and vegetables undergo primary processing, packing, and temporary storage before being transported to markets. It provides a physical structure where harvested produce is handled and prepared for distribution. In a packhouse, various tasks are carried out to ready products for market distribution, including: • Cleaning: Washing produce to remove dirt and debris. • Sorting and grading: Categorizing items based on quality and size. • Pre-Treatments: Applying protective coatings or treatments to extend shelf-life. • Packing: Packing produce into appropriate containers. • Cooling: Preserving freshness through temperature control. • Storage: Maintaining quality in a controlled environment. Reasons for Post-harvest losses • Insufficient knowledge regarding suitable methods for harvesting fruits and vegetables. • Inadequate transportation and packaging methods. • Breaks in the cold supply chain, leading to temperature fluctuations that affect product quality. • Limited capacity in cold storage facilities. • Lack of cold storage facilities close to farms. • Deficiencies in marketing infrastructure. • Inefficiencies within the supply chain.

Each operation is crucial to ensure produce reaches consumers in optimal condition. In essence, a packhouse is a key component of post- harvest management infrastructure for fresh fruits and vegetables. It involves acquiring fresh produce directly from farmers/FPOs or through collection points and adding value through sorting, grading, packing, ripening, and/or cold storage. The processed and value- added produce is then sold to exporters, wholesalers, retailers, processors, and other stakeholders.
