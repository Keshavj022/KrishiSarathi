 Herbicides for efficient weed control in mungbean: A new-generation ready-mix herbicide, Clodinafop- propargyl + Na-acifluorfen (CPNaA), found promising for post-emergence weed control, has demonstrated increased efficacy in mungbean. In a field experiment conducted during the 2020-2022, this herbicide (24.5 EC: ready-mix) was tested at three different doses (122.5, 183.5, and 245 g a.i./ha) and applied at four different times (10, 15, 20, 25 DAS). The study also included unweeded control (UWC) and weed-free check (WFC) treatments to optimize dosage and timing. The application of Clodinafop-propargyl + Na-acifluorfen (CPNaA) at 183.5 g/ha between 15-20 days after sowing significantly improved results in terms of weed control efficiency, mungbean yield, and economic returns compared to the other treatment combinations. Development of sub-surface drip fertigation system in maize-wheat system: The lateral with built- in drippers at 30 cm interval have been established 45 cm apart a depth of 20 cm below the soil surface. In maize, sub-surface drip fertigation (SSDF) of 50% recommend phosphorus in 3 splits resulted in similar yield as 100% RDP, either fertigated or conventionally applied. Skipping P caused 20â€“30% yield reduction. In wheat, NDVI values were similar among 50% RDP given in 2 splits, 75% RDP and 100% RDP under SSDF; all were better than 100% RDP applied in conventional way under surface (border irrigation). Fifty percent RDK applied through SSDF resulted in 9.5% higher grain yield over 100% RDK in conservation tillage and about 20% higher than 100% RDK under conventional tillage. Under sub-surface drip fertigation (SSDF), an increase in K dose beyond 50% RDK did not bring significant yield improvement, hence a 50% K saving is possible through SSDF. Highest AEK and KUE were also found with 50% RDK through SSDF. Giving 50% DRK in 3 splits stood at par with 75 and 100% RDK applied in 3 Precision irrigation in field pea under conservation tillage practices Improving resourc-use efficiency, with a specific focus on water management, stands as a top priority in sustainable crop production research. A fixed plot field experiment showed that adopting zero tillage (ZT) in both crops in combination with sprinkler irrigation during branching and pod development stages of field pea led to enhanced productivity, profitability, and water-use efficiency in the maize-field pea system. It is worth noting that ZT outperformed conventional tillage (CT) in terms of grain yield, biomass production, and the overall economics of the system. Zero tillage resulted in significantly higher water-use efficiency (119.5 kg/ha-cm) and water productivity (1.37 kg of crop biomass per 1,000 L of water), both of which were markedly superior to the RT and CT practices. Additionally, ZT led to a notable 17.6% increase in soil organic carbon compared to the CT.
