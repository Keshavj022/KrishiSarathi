 Manually operated low land rice seeder: During peak transplanting season, labour availability is scarce resulting in delayed transplanting with aged seedlings, which in turn affects productivity. To overcome this problem, pre‐ germinated low land rice seeder has been developed. The field capacity varied from 0.1 to 0.14 ha/h with labour requirement of 15‐20 man‐h/ha. The traditional method requires a total of 964‐1000 man‐h/ha. Cost of operation of the machine is Rs 135/ha as compared to Rs 205/ha by traditional method. 4.4 Tractor operated zero‐till seed‐cum‐fertilizer drill: The zero‐till seed‐ fertilizer drill was developed to sow wheat directly in rice‐harvested fields without preparing the seedbed. The field capacity of the machine is 0.3 ha/h. The cost of operation by traditional method is Rs. 3,400/ha. The machine saves Rs 1500‐3000/ha. 4.5. Tractor mounted raised bed planter: A bed‐former‐cum‐seeder has been developed for sowing wheat. The machine can make three beds in single run and the width of each bed is adjustable (35 to 45 cm). A Planting attachment has also been made with the machine for sowing maize, groundnut, cotton etc on the beds. The field capacity of machine is 0.26 ha/h. The cost of operation is about Rs. 4500/ha as compared to conventional method (Rs. 3400/ha). The crop being sown on beds, it saves about 20‐30% water and 20% seeds. 4.6. Tractor mounted inclined plate planter: The CIAE 6‐row tractor mounted inclined plate planter has been adopted for sowing intercrop on broad beds and a bed shaping/forming attachment has been added as an integral part in the refined design of the planter. During field trials with three rows of soybean and two rows of Pigeon Pea at 300 mm row‐to‐row spacing, the field capacity is 0.42 ha/h with an effective width of coverage of 1850 mm. The cost of operation is Rs. 1280/ha as compared to Rs. 1560/ha by conventional method. 4.7. Self‐propelled rice transplanter: It is suitable for transplanting paddy seedlings in puddled soils. Machine uses mat type seedlings and it can transplant 1.2‐1.5 ha/day with the help of 5 persons by working at a speed of 1.1‐1.5 km/h. It saves about 65% labour and 40% cost of operation as compared to manual transplanting. The cost of operation is Rs. 2,000/ha as compared to Rs. 3,000/ha by traditional methods. 4.8. Tractor operated Sett Cutter Planter for sugarcane: This machine cuts whole sugarcane in to pieces of uniform size, places the sets in the furrow prepared by ridger, covers the sets by soil and press the soil in one operation. Fertilizers and chemical can also be applied. The field capacity is 0.20 ha/h. The cost of operation of equipment is Rs. 2000/ha as against Rs. 3300/ha by traditional method. 4.9. Self‐propelled power weeder: The machine is also useful in row crops, horticultural and vegetable crops. The average cost of weeding with power weeder is Rs 1000/ha. The speed of power weeder can be varied from 2.3‐2.5 km/h and the field capacity is 0.
