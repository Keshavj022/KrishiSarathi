49 The results were validated over the study area by developing a practical correction factor for its wider applicability with the similar specifications of the rain gauges used in the present study. To develop a correction factor, the rainfall data obtained from both the rain gauges were fitted with the linear relationships, as given below. RS = CF × RI where RS, Rainfall measured by standard rain guage (mm); CF , Correction factor; and RI, Rainfall measured by indigenous rain gauge (mm). The correction factor obtained from the results was 0.32. A positive correlation was observed with the rainfall RAIN WATER MANAGEMENT Table 3.

Similarly, the correction factor was developed for the rainfall data measured at Gunegal Research Farm, CRIDA, which was 0.35 with R2 =0.93. An attempt was made to relate the rainfall of IR with that of the agricultural operations performed by the farmers at different sites (Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4). This process can help utilize the IR for suggesting various agricultural operations to the farmers of remote areas where the facility of recording rainfall through SR is not possible. During the course of the study focus group interactions with many farmers were organized during the field day at Gunegal Research Farm to understand the perception of the farmers on the utility of IR.
