 Mango:   Spray mixture of DDVP 4 ml and Methyleugenol 10 ml in 10 litres of water for control of fruit fly. Apply irrigation as per need. Guava:   During the flowering /fruiting stage, install pheromone traps @ 18 – 20 per ha to control the fruit fly damage. For the central Gujarat Guava variety GARFG – 1 (Gujarat Anand Red Flash Guava – 1) should be preferred for batter production and quality of fruit. Livestock /Poultry:   Under present weather condition, keep animals under shade or in sheds during noon hours, provide plenty of cool water mixed with minerals for drinking and shower the animals with cold water two to three times in a day.   Do Vaccination for Haemorrhageic septicemia (H.S.) disease and Blue Quarter (B.Q.) in animals. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 130   Udder of milking animals must be properly cleaned with zinc oxide or boric powder.   Also give deworming tablet to younger animals. For control of ticks and mites spray Deltamethrin or Amitral 2 ml/liter of water.   Spray sanitizers or phenyl in the animal shed to avoid flies and mosquitoes. Give stored fodder with mineral mixture. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 131 Zone–9 Madhya Pradesh Soybean   Early maturing varieties of Soybean RVS 2007-6, NRC-37.   Use of high yielding varieties like JS 20- 34, JS 20- 69, JS 20- 98, JS 20-116, JS 335, RVS 2001-4, RVS 2008, NRC 86, Raj Soya-18, Raj Soya-24, RSVSM 2011-35, JS 20-29, JS 95-60, JS 93-05, JS 20-94 and RVS 76.   Eradication of pest propagules the pupa of major pest, there sting structure of major pathogens are lying at our farms at threshing floor and in the soil to minimized the initial pest/pathogen load, sanitation of threshing floor, deep ploughing of field. Sanitation bunds etc. is must farmer should collect all crops debris and buried them of compost pit.   Preparation of seed- Seed material of crop should be processed very carefully all physically damaged discolored undersize seed must be picked off. Only clean healthy pest and disease free material should be stored as seed.   During the month of May seed treatment with Carbendazim 2 g/kg seed or Vitavax 2 g/kg seed followed by treatment with 2 g/kg Thiomethaxam or 2g Imidachloprid per kg seed followed by Trichoderma viride 10g per kg. Seed treatment must be done in second fortnight of June.   Seed Germination test- Before onset of monsoon, the germination test of soybean seed must be done. The farmers can do it at his own farm in towel paper or jute bags can be deep in clean water and 1000 seed randomly collected can be put in well- organized lines on jute bag or towel paper the nit can be rolled up and placed well In protected room away from direct sunlight, after 4-5 days the jute bag can be unfold and healthy germ tube can be counted. Germination test is very important to get the optimum plant population. Lower the plant population well reduces the yield higher the plant population will attract the incidence of many pest and diseases.
