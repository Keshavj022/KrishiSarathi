The number of respondents who respond to a survey question may differ from those who chose not to respond, thus creating biases. • Survey question answer options could lead to unclear data because respondents may interpret certain answer options differently. For example, the answer option "somewhat agree" may represent different things to different subjects and have its own meaning to each respondent. • The present pandemic situation may also affect the participant’s interest in answering. 3.4. Ethical consideration The collected data from the respondents are kept confidential., Re­ spondents are well-informed about the goals and objectives of the project and the questionnaires. The collected data will be kept safe from unauthorized persons. The participants should not feel unduly pres­ sured, cajoled, or coerced into taking part in a survey., Participants are free to unanswer any of the questions if they prefer. 4. Conclusion This paper analyzed the underlying factors for the agriculture sector Fig. 2. Opinion on different factors related to the new emerging technology.
