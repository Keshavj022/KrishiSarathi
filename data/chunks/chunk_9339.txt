 Few examples of such introductions includes cereals like wheat, maize, barley, and oats; oilseeds like soybean, groundnut and sunflower; pulses- chickpea, peas, and French bean; fiber crop like cotton; medicinal plants; vegetables like potato, tomato, cauliflower, cabbage, onion and carrot; fruits like grapes, apple, pear, peach, apricot, and cherry.

They played a major role in the augmentation of crop resources in this region (Arora and Nayar 1984). Similarly, vast diversity occurs in natural habitats for medicinal and aromatic plant species and for forage grasses. Many of the medicinal plants genetic resources have great industrial 65 applications for instance Cymbopogon spp., Emblica officinalis, Nardostachys jatamansi, Ocimum spp., Podophyllum hexandrum, Rauvolfia serpentina and Swertia chirayata. Different biodiversity hotspots in India collectively have more than 400 species of legume forages (Arora and Chandel 1972). These include Alysicarpus, Astragalus, Caragana, Cicer, Crotolaria, Desmodium, Indigofera, Lespedeza, Medicago, Melilotus, Pueraria, Rhyncosia, Smithia and Trigonella., Over 1250 species occur among grasses of which about 600 are considered as promising wild forages. India is endowed with rich animal genetic resources. The total number of recognized indigenous breeds now in the country is 197, which include 50 for cattle, 44 for sheep, 34 for goat, 17 for buffalo, 7 for horses and ponies, 9 for camel, 10 for pig, 3 for donkey, 1 for yak, 19 for chicken, 2 for duck and 1 for geese (Table 2).
