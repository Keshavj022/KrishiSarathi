 Considering the fact that the Private Sector is now an eminent employer of agricultural graduates with a large demand for suitably trained and equipped graduates in agricultural sciences to meet the rapid expanding growth in the modern food and agro industry, new academic programmes have been developed and existing curricula revised and upgraded to meet the requirements, including the Student READY programme. Adequate coverage has been provided in respect of new technologies such as biotechnology, information technology, bioinformatics, GIS, remote sensing, precision agriculture, hi-tech cultivation, secondary agriculture, conservation agriculture, organic farming, international agriculture, processing and value addition, agribusiness management, and communication skills. The course curricula have been restructured and reoriented to develop much needed skills and entrepreneurial mind-set among the graduates to take up self-employment, to sustainably enhance rural livelihood security, and to propel agricultural transformation through science informed policy options and actions. The Committee has made efforts to include relevant practical skills and entrepreneur aptitude, and to impart confidence among graduates. To reorient graduates of Agriculture and allied subjects for higher employability and greater entrepreneurship, the Student READY (Rural and Entrepreneurship Awareness Yojna) programme has been introduced in all the Agricultural Universities as an essential prerequisite for the award of degree to ensure hands-on experience and practical training. Considering the variation in different streams of agricultural education and feasibility, the Committee has proposed to include following components, which are interactive and are conceptualized for building skills in project development and execution, decision-making, individual and team coordination, approach to problem solving, accounting, quality control, marketing and resolving conflicts, etc. These are: (i) Experiential Learning/Hands on Training (ii) Skill Development Training (iii) Rural Agriculture Work Experience (iv) In Plant Training/ Industrial attachment (v) Students Projects Due attention has been given to areas of training and institutions for improving faculty competence for the purpose. The Committee has also recommended that some of the courses like Environmental Studies and Disaster Management, Communication Skills and Personality Development, Information and Communication Technology, Entrepreneurship Development and Business Management, Agri- Informatics and Economics and Marketing need to be taught in all the undergraduate programmes of agricultural sciences, as these are must for personality development and to deal with the unforeseen circumstances. The Committee has distributed the courses in a AGRICULTURAL HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016â€“17 106 systematic way so as to teach basic courses first followed by principles and finally skill development.
