The cutworm, which is more common, is effectively checked by this practice. Rock salt is mixed with the seed soaked in water. For treatment of 4-5 kg seed, Â½ kg salt is required. It has been found effective to the extent of 25% against the infestation of insect- pests in the crop. This treatment is common in maize growing areas of Jammu region (Jammu and Kashmir).
