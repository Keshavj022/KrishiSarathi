35 shisham leaf may be used safely to treat diarrhoea in animals. Therapeutic study Diarrhoeic calves were subjected to close clinical examination. They were dull, depressed, dehy-drated and after recumbent (Fig 5 and 6). Shisham leaf powder was fed to them after mixing with water (Fig 7).The data presented in Tables 4 to 7 indicate that shisham leaf powder given orally @ 105g/ 100 kg b. wt. with or without antibiotic therapy was effective for treatment of diarrhoea and recovery in terms of faecal consistency which was better in shisham leaf treatment group as compared to standard antibiotic. CONCLUSION The efficacy of paste of shisham leaves in the treatment of diarrhoea is very good with 70% cure, as judged by PRA method. The efficacy was, though, slightly less than allopathic medication,  VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Table 7.

Experimental toxic study results also showed that shisham leaves is safe to the animals for use as oral drench even at higher dose than that used for treatment of diarrhoea. Further studies involving clinical trial on various types of diarrhoeic animals and active ingredient identification / analysis are required to confirm the findings. Table 6.
