Significant positive effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on plant growth parameters, pod attributes and grain yield were observed in soybean-wheat cropping system. Interaction of eCO2 and N can be exploited in modulating the EPS producing bacterial population, thereby affecting the total EPS/ soil carbohydrate, which will alleviate soil moisture deficit stress. Biochemical and endocrine parameters revealed that high serum free fatty acids and low leptin levels are concerted negative energy balance (NEB) indicators in buffaloes.
