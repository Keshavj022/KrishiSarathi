Chaudhary (1992) 585 Tradional wool combing and spinning In temperate Himalayas, farmers use large sized shearer/scissors for shearing wool from goats and sheep. The sheared wool is combed and made smooth either with a special comber called kangoo or with a special arrow like device called phanani. The combed wool is stored in small bamboo basket (kamoli). These small woolen packs are used for spinning a thread with a special spindle known as taklu. These woollen threads are used for making woollen fabrics like blankets (pattu) long woolen cloth (lahanga/pattee) dark-black woollen cord (dora) and shawls which are generally woven by gaddies on indigenous handlooms (Temperate Himalayas of Himachal Pradesh).

Parmar (1992b) 587 Treatment of in grown horn wound As an animal ages, its horn often curls so that it penetrates the head or the lower portion of the horn. Not only is this deformed horn easily broken, but the wound is susceptible to infection. To treat the wound, a few human hairs are added to a paste of nagli (Eleusine coracana- a minor millet) flour and water. This paste is applied and the wound is bandaged until the wound is healed. This practice has existed for at least 15 years. Ravjibhai Vasava recently used it with success (Bharuch, Gujarat).
