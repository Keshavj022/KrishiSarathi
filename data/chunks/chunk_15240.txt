Hyperspectral imaging has emerged as a game-changer in high-resolution crop monitoring and analysis. Its ability to capture detailed spectral information provides farmers and researchers with valuable data to optimize agricultural prac- tices, improve crop health, and enhance overall crop produc- tivity in a precise and sustainable manner. 4.3. Sensor Networks: Collaborative Data Gathering and Spatial Mapping. Sensor networks play a crucial role in col- laborative data gathering and spatial mapping, enabling efﬁ- cient and comprehensive data collection across various applications. A sensor network is a collection of intercon- nected sensors that work together to monitor, measure, and collect data from the environment. These networks can be deployed in diverse settings, such as agriculture, environ- mental monitoring, smart cities, healthcare, and industrial automation. The following are the amenities that sensor net- works deliver for collaborative data gathering and spatial mapping: 1. Real-time data collection: Sensor networks facilitate ongoing real-time data gathering on diverse environ- mental parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light conditions. These data support farmers in making prompt decisions [42]. 2. Remote monitoring: Sensor networks enable farmers to oversee their ﬁelds and crops from a distance, minimizing the necessity for physical presence, and enabling rapid responses to any problems or irregularities. 3. Data integration: Sensor networks can consolidate data from various origins, such as weather predic- tions, satellite imagery, and historical records, to offer a holistic perspective of the farm’s status. 4. Crop health monitoring: Sensors can detect early signs of disease, pests, or nutrient deﬁciencies, help- ing farmers take proactive measures to protect and enhance crop health. 5.
