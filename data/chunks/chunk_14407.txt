The main intervention activities of video production, group meetings, and follow-up home visits constituted the largest share of total costs (ranging from 52% in AGRI-NUT + PLA to 69% in AGRI). These activities were followed by the quality assurance and monitoring activities (ranging from 25% in the AGRI arm to 41% in the AGRI-NUT + PLA arm) (Figure 4). In the AGRI-NUT + PLA arm, more staff time was spent on the quality assurance of the PLA component from 1 partner (Ekjut). Decomposing the total program costs to line items or inputs (as given in Table 3) shows that staff costs constituted the most costs, at ∼60% in each intervention arm, ranging from 56% in the AGRI-NUT arm to 65% in the AGRI-NUT + PLA arm. The staff costs were followed by other recurrent costs (travel costs and office overheads), varying from 29% in the AGRI- NUT + PLA arm to 39% in the AGRI-NUT arm, mainly due to the large portion of international travel by international staff (JSI RTI) in the AGRI-NUT arm. Most staff costs related to the delivery of interventions, i.e., salary for 24–26 facilitators per arm and 2–3 supervisors per arm, followed by support provided by technical assistance and research partners (Supplemental Figure 1).
