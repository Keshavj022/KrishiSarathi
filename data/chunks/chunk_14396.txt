 Substantial shares of total costs were attributable to development and delivery of the videos and PLA (52–69%) and quality assurance (25–41%). Relative to control, minimum dietary diversity was higher in the children who underwent the interventions incorporating nutrition-specific videos and PLA (adjusted RRs: 1.19 and 1.27; 95% CIs: 1.03–1.37 and 1.11, 1.46, respectively). Relative to control, minimum dietary diversity in mothers was higher in those who underwent NSA video (1.21 [1.01, 1.45]) and NSA with PLA (1.30 [1.10, 1.53]) interventions. Conclusion: NSA videos with PLA can increase both maternal and child dietary diversity and have the lowest cost per unit increase in diet diversity. Building on investments made in developing UPAVAN, cost-efficiency at scale could be increased with less intensive monitoring, reduced startup costs, and integration within existing government programs.

First published online June 10, 2022; doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxac132. 2255 Background There is strong evidence on the impacts and cost-effectiveness of nutrition-specific interventions (1–4), particularly in settings with high undernutrition burdens, such as India. However, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets (5) to end hunger and undernutrition (SDG 2), multisectoral approaches are needed to address the underlying causes of undernutrition (6). In rural areas of low- and middle- income countries, where the burden of undernutrition is highest and smallholder farming provides a major source of nutrition and income (7), the agriculture sector could provide “nutrition-sensitive” interventions that improve both nutrition and agriculture outcomes simultaneously.. Trials of nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) interventions have shown that these interventions may improve dietary outcomes, with results suggesting that the implementation of these interventions at scale may be a policy option. Of the 8 trials that tested the effects of NSA interventions on minimum dietary diversity of children, 4 trials showed a significant increase, although neither of the 2 NSA trials measuring impacts on maternal dietary diversity showed an effect (8).
