 The proposed allocations are based on congruence approach, which takes into consideration the multiple research objectives of efficiency, equity and sustainability. The results suggested reallocation of the NATP research resources across various agro-ecoregions. Irrigated agro-ecoregion should get 9% more of the research resources. Further, results suggested that about one-half of the research resources should be allocated to livestock sector in arid agro-ecoregion. Similarly, about 30% of research resources should go to horticultural crops in coastal agro-ecoregion. AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS AND COMPUTER APPLICATION Vegetables are short duration crops with multiple pickings and estimation of extent of their cultivation and production poses several methodological problems. Realising the need of the methodology, the IASRI, New Delhi, had conducted series of pilot sample surveys and the methodology for estimation of area and production at district level was developed. In these surveys, the data for yield were collected for all the pickings of the selected plots. This necessitates the presence of enumerator in limited number of selected villages, as frequent visits are needed for attending every picking in the selected fields. This is cost prohibitive, therefore, an alternate procedure was investigated in which yield is estimated on the basis of partial harvest.
