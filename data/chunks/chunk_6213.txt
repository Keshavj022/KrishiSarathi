 A group of 12 cattle was treated with the conventional therapy comprising an antibiotic (Moxel @ 2-3 g intramuscularly daily for 4 days) and an analgesic (Butagesic @ 10 ml intramuscularly daily for 3 days). The foot and mouth lesions were washed with 1% potassium permanganate solution twice daily. Boroglycerine was applied on mouth lesions and Himax ointment was applied on foot lesions after washing. The healing of lesions was assessed on the basis of colour of wound, quantity and type of exudation and pain on a scale of 0-4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The application of the ITK comprising bantulsi leaf paste resulted in recovery of foot lesions within 14 to 15 days. However the conventional veterinary treatment resulted in recovery from foot and mouth lesions within 6 to 7 days. Wound exudation, pain and lameness decreased in both Table 2.

However, in ITK treatment group, the healing of wound lesions remained incomplete and the gait of animals showed slight lameness till the period of observation (Table 2). The results indicated that ITK was moderately effective in the management of foot lesions in FMD. Farmers were advised to repeat the treatment in similar manner twice or thrice daily and to restrict the grazing of animals and entry into the muddy places. The animals were examined for healing of the lesion after 7 days. The information to decide the recovery rate was collected from farmers. CONCLUSION The ITK consisting of the use bantulsi was moderately effective in the management of foot lesions in FMD affected animals. The extract of bantulsi also did not reveal antiviral activity against blue-tongue and goat-pox viruses. â–¡ Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Code Title of the ITK Description of ITK : 1280 : Use of stone apple (bael) to check diarrhoea in animals : Stone apple (bael) might have anti-diarrhoea ingredient. Its juice is mixed with water and drenched to the animals suffering from diarrhoea, 2-3-times a day. Treatment per animal costs Rs 15 to 20. The animal is cured in 2-3 days. This practice is in use in many villages of Budaun, Shahjahanpur and Bareiily in Uttar Pradesh.
