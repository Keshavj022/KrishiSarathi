 Kashi Baingani French bean which flowers at 70-80 days after sowing, has been identified for cultivation in Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka. Promising onion hybrids identified were DOGR Hy-73, DOGR Hy-173 and DOGR Hy-179. White onion variety GJWO-3 was identified for cultivation during rabi. Promising potato varieties identified were Kufri FryoM, Kufri Karan, Kufri Manik, Kufri Sahyadri, Kufri Thar-1, Kufri Thar-2, Kufri Thar-3, Kufri Sangam and Hybrid Kufri Chipsona-4. High yielding seed spices varieties developed were Ajmer Ajwain-73 and Ajmer Nigella-1. For the first time, a draft genome sequence of the popular Indian cashew cv. Bhaskara was generated using hybrid genome assembly approaches. Livestock improvement: The cattle Frieswal was declared a breed and subsequently a trademark FrieswalTM was obtained. Frieswal, a crossbred cattle variety, was released and included as a breed in national milch herd. A bull mother farm of Frieswal cattle was established at ICAR-NDRI, Karnal by selecting 208 Frieswal cows/heifers from 850 elite cows. The average 300-day lactation milk production potential of Frieswal cows is 3,335 kg. The total lactation milk yield of this breed is 3,628 kg. The average age at first calving (AFC) of Frieswal progenies decreased by 15.77% in KVASU (957.1 days vs 1136.4 days), 31.91% in GADVASU (811.6 days vs 1192 days), 18.79% in BAIF (793 days vs 976.5 days) and 14.2% in GBPUAT Unit (985.8 days vs 1149 days). Under the Indigenous Breeds Project (IBP), genetic improvements of three breeds, viz. Gir, Kankrej, and Sahiwal were carried out through the selection of elite animals. Under Mega Sheep Seed Project, the improvement of indigenous sheep breeds was carried out by propagation of superior germplasm in the farmers’ flock. A total of 345 improved goat germplasm of different breeds were supplied to farmers and different developmental agencies for improving production performance in field conditions. The institutional flock of Jakhrana goats exhibited an average milk production 147.72±3.66l litres in 90 days and 192.40±5.58 litres in 120 days. The follicular dynamics concerning the changes in concentrations of hormones during the estrous cycle in pubertal mithun was evaluated. Two male lines of poultry, viz. PD-1 (Vanaraja male line) and PD-6 (Gramapriya male line) and two female lines, PD-2 (Vanaraja female) and PD-3 (Brown egg layer line) were improved. A total of five crosses were produced by crossing Aseel males with females of PD- 1, PD-2, PD-6, PB-1, PB-2 lines and evaluated up to 12 weeks of age. The indigenous ornamental fish, channa stewartii, collected from beels of Assam was raised to broodstock in concrete tanks. The complete technology of breeding and seed production of ornamental fish silver moony was developed and is ready for transfer and entrepreneurship development.
