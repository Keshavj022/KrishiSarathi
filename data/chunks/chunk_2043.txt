 The continuous date wise DO and temperature data are stored in the excel file for further analysis. The power supply to the system can be battery-powered, standard electricity supply and/or solar battery powered. Figure 3: System workflow of DO monitoring system Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report interface and downloaded in excel format for any further research. Web-interface was developed using ThingSpeak loT analytic platform service. b . System architecture The architecture of the DO system is described in the Fig. 3. The system is made up of a microcontroller, an internet connectivity source for connecting to the internet and it attached with a DO sensor which is installed in the waterbody. The devise is capable of detecting the DO sensor and convert it into digital form. The converted DO reading is transmitted over the internet and store in the cloud space. A web interface was developed using ThingSpeak loT analytic platform service to display the real time DO reading of the waterbody with an interval of 10 minute. The date wise DO status of the waterbody can be downloaded in Excel format. Farm owner/end user can access the real-time DO level and temperature of the waterbody via internet from any location. The continuous date wise DO and temperature data are stored in the excel file for further analysis. The power supply to the system can be battery-powered, standard electricity supply and/or solar battery powered. jet a rr a Se ss DO monitoring system Detachable Solar power for loT system ‘ ! ! | | Local display ! —_ y P v q 1 - = ' 1 / \ 1 | i , Cloud | \ 1 { et |. ~ server) /. — f toes !

It acquires the signal from the sensor, processes it and then feeds it to the microcontroller where the signal is converted into DO data. After the conversion it is used to control the aerator by comparing it with the set-point set during the programming. On the same time the microcontroller uploads the DO value to the cloud server.  Aerator supplies air bubbles to increase DO value in water, by receiving the signal from the microcontroller via the relay.  Local display screen is used to display the DO and temperature data for real-time monitoring.  Mobile phone or any PC is used to view the DO value live or previous stored data connected via internet.
