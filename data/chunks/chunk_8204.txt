 Introduction of pulses in coconut did not hamper coconut productivity despite a built-up of soil N by 23 kg/ha owing to biological N fixation. + Zn, Cu, Mn, B (50% soil + 50% foliar application) with maximum (0.90) Sustainable Yield Index (SYI). Significantly maximum fruit yield (80.4 kg/tree) in mango (cv. Dashehari) and water- use efficiency (12.56 kg/m3)were recorded due to 100% recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) applied at different critical phenological stages as compared to 59.4 kg and 9.28 kg/m3, respectively in untreated check. Similarly in mango cv. Dashehari, drip irrigation (60% PE) coupled with polythene mulching, resulted in 10.9 tonnes /ha fruit yield with 45-58% water saving compared with rainfed check (6.9 t/ha). Guava: Drip irrigation coupled with polythene mulching in high-density plantation of guava cv. Allahabad Safeda (80% Pan Evaporation Replenishment) resulted in fruit yield of 16.92 kg/m3 along with 47.52% water saving as compared to 8.21 kg/m3 in untreated check. Grape: In Fantasy Seedless vines, pan evaporation based growth stage-wise irrigation schedule with 262.4 mm of applied irrigation along with rainfall (691 mm) produced yield on par with highest treatment (332.3 mm). Use of subsurface irrigation and recommended irrigation schedule through surface drip irrigation led to 46.8% and 25.9% savings in irrigation water respectively at Jath. At Palsi, use of partial root zone drying (PRD) technique resulted in saving of 19.1- 26.6% irrigation water. Pomegranate: The application of water soluble NPK fertilizers with irrigation water at 75% of RD at 7 days interval recorded highest amount of available N and K content of soil, while application of the same at 50% of RD at 15 days interval recorded highest available soil P content. Further, application of 75% of RD of N-P-K through fertigation at both 7 and 15 days interval recorded significantly higher DTPA extractable Mn content of soil, while 50% of RD of N-P-K applied through fertigation at 15 days interval noted higher DTPA extractable Fe and Zn content of soil. Fertigation of 75% of RD of NPK at 15 days interval resulted in significantly higher DTPA extractable Cu content of soil. Okra: In spring-summer okra (March - May), drip irrigation at 100% PE (pan evaporation) coupled with organic mulch (pea straw @ 12 t/ha) yielded maximum (125.33 q/ha) fruits giving 64.8% higher yield over surface irrigation without mulch. Maximum water-use efficiency (WUE, kg yield/mm water) of 31.53 was recorded under drip irrigation at 60% PE + organic mulch, besides saving 49% of water. Organic mulching registered 23.9% and 39.3% higher yield, respectively over black-silver polyethylene (B-S) mulch and un- mulched control. The WUE in organic mulch, B-S mulch and un-mulch were 22.78, 18.37 and 15.84 kg/ mm water, respectively. The maximum WUE of 24.84 kg/mm water was recorded with 80% PE.
