 No significant difference in recovery period or post-treatment inflammatory swelling in two groups. Values in parentheses indicate the range of recovery period. Fig. 4.

Treatment of inflammation with iodine in buffalo at MASFSU. A. Swelling; B. Poultice applied; C. Swelling subsided and was found significant at 1% level. The difference in the diameter of inflammation in the poultice-treated group was compared with the difference in the diameter of the inflammation observed in iodine ointment treated group. In ITK group, inflammatory swelling was 13.36 cm, which decreased to 3.57 after treatment. The average recovery period in this group was 6.8 days; it Table 2.

After treatment differed non-significantly with the group treated with iodine ointment (Table 1). It indicates that the treatment with bhangariya poultice was equally effective to that of iodine-ointment treatment. The observations recorded at TANUVAS before and after application of ITK are given in Table 2 and Fig. 6 (A-J). Rubor: The redness of the affected area was visually observed and the grading revealed on day 0 was 3.81 + 0.82. Application of the medicament redness on day 3 decreased to 2.45 ± 0.52 and on day 6 it further decreased to 0.72 ±0.15. The parameter studied revealed that the medicament induced beneficial effect by virtue of its property to provide local hypothermic effect (Fig. 7). Callor: Warmth of the inflammatory swelling was studied by physical assessment. Of the 22 cases, increase in local temperature on day 0 was 3.86 ± 0.82 and during the treatment it decreased to 2.36 ± 0.50 on day 6 and to 0.31 ± 0.06 on day 3, perhaps due to the hypothermic effect. (Fig.8) Dallor: Pain on the affected area was assessed by visual analogue systemic changes. The study revealed that pain analogue was 3.90 ± 0.83 on day 0 and decreased to 2.45 ± 0.52 on day 3 and further decreased to 0.5 ± 0.10 on day 6 after the application of the medicament, which could be attributed to the anodyne effect of the medicament. (Fig. 9) Tumour: Tumour indicates the swelling of the affected area and on day 0 the grading was 3.81 ± 0.81 and on day 3 it decreased to 2.09 ± 0.44 and further decreased to 0.31 ± 0.06 on day 6 (Fig.
