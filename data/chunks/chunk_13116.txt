Fully matured female exhibits bulged abdomen and prominent genital papilla, while mature males are slender, having longer anal fins and oozes milt on pressing the belly.  Brooders are raised in pond. Brooders of 40-100 g are induced bred with commercial hormone (Ovaprim/Ovatide/WOVA-FH/GonoproFH) injection @ 0.5-1.0 µl/g to female and 0.25-0.5 µl/g body weight to male.  Spawning occur in 7-8 h and fish lay eggs having dia of 70-85 µm. Fecundity is 300-400 eggs/g body weight. Eggs are non-adhesive and floating.  Eggs are incubated in plastic tubs/FRP tanks where they hatch out in 12-15 hrs at 26-28ºC.  Newly hatched larvae are 1.6-1.8 mm in total length and reared in indoor FRP/concrete tanks of 500-1000 l capacity with water depth of 50-60 cm.  The spawn are reared for 3 weeks in FRP/concrete tanks at stocking density of 1000-1500 nos/m2 and fed with zooplanktons for first two weeks when they attain size of 12-16 mm and subsequently on powdered formulated feed with 35% protein.  Size heterogeneity and cannibalism occurs during seed rearing and hence, grading has to be done on routine basis for higher survival. A survival of 30-35% is achieved at fry stage.  The technology is being adopted in West Bengal, Assam, Tripura and Odisha.

Migrate from estuaries to freshwater river zones.  It is a highly predatory fish and fed on frozen fishes like oil sardines and tilapia @ 5% body weight on daily basis for raising broodstock in captivity.  Sexes are separate, but sex-differentiation is difficult from external features. Attains maturity as male first when it is less than 3 years of age and subsequently sex changes to female. A multiple spawner, which spawn about 1.0 million eggs/kg body weight in different batches.  Male exudes milky milt on pressing the belly. Females are identified with having soft round belly, pinkish genital papilla and emerging of ova from vent on pressing the belly.  For captive breeding, pairs are made in ratio of 1:2 female to male. Females with ova size >0.450 mm and oozing males are selected and induced for spawning with injection of LHRHa hormone @ 60-70 μg/kg for females and 30-35 μg/kg for males.  Spawning takes place spontaneously after 30-36 h of the injection.
