13 EJ of natural gas, 0.40 EJ of nuclear energy, and 1.33 EJ of renewable energy (BP, 2021). Similarly, India’s electricity generation increased from 0.671 EJ in 1985 to 4.96 EJ in 2019 (Ritchie et al., 2022). Fig. 1 depicts India’s key energy and economy indicators like gross domestic product (GDP), energy demand, oil demand, CO2 emissions per capita, along with others) as a percentage of the global average. Compared to 2000, in 2019, the indicators can be seen rising steadily, but these data are well below the global average. Since 2005, India’s CO2 emissions have more than doubled, owing to a rapid increase in coal consumption (Myllyvirta, 2019). In 2017, India was accountable for 6.88% of global CO2 emissions, with an annual emission of 2.42 billion t CO2 (Ritchie et al., 2020). Although India’s energy demand continuously increases with its increasing population, inadequate native energy production and supply have forced its dependency on oil, coal, and gas imports. The production and imports in the case of coal, oil, and gas for the past two decades are shown in Fig. 2. India’s average monthly oil import was 17.51 Million Tonnes (MT) from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2023.02.054 2352-4847/© 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Coal has the highest share in India’s energy mix, which has increased from 40% in 2010 to 44% in 2019. It contributes to 70% of the electricity produced in the country (IEA, 2021). By 2040, India’s annual coal demand is expected to reach 772 MT (IEA, 2021). Since 2011, India has become the fourth largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and its import capacity has increased by 200% in the past ten years (Zaretskaya, 2020). Recently, the Indian government has been investing signif- icantly in developing the renewable energy sector within the country to meet energy demands in a more efficient and eco- friendly manner. India’s renewable energy market is the fourth largest in the world. According to COP26, India has committed to achieving zero emissions by 2070.
