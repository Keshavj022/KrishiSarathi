 The research started with farmers’ fields soil analysis just before the wheat sowing in the winter (rabi) season of 2022–23. The soil samples were carefully collected from a depth of 0–15 cm and subsequently dried in shaded areas. The dried samples were then analyzed at the resource management laboratory of ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat Indian Farming 38 September 2023 and Barley Research, Karnal to determine various soil properties, including pH, electrical conductivity (dS/m), organic carbon content (%), available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). The analysis revealed that all the soils exhibited a slightly alkaline nature and were not saline. Among these fields, 25 had low organic carbon levels, 37 had medium organic carbon levels, and 38 had high organic carbon levels. In terms of available nitrogen, all fields exhibited low levels ranging from 52.9–170.5 kg/ha. The available phosphorus content ranged from 4.0–35.1 kg/ha, with 79 fields having low levels (<10 kg/ha), 20 fields having medium levels (10–25 kg/ha), and 1 field having high levels. Available potassium varied from 87.4–558.9 kg/ha, with 19 fields having low levels (<140 kg/ha), 54 fields having medium levels (140– 280 kg/ha), and 27 fields having high levels (>280 kg/ha). All the farmers in the district followed a rice-wheat cropping system. Detailed records of the farmers’ activities, from sowing to harvesting, were maintained. It was observed that 71 out of 100 farmers applied nitrogen at doses exceeding the recommended amount of 150 kg N/ha. All farmers used di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) for phosphorus application, with quantities ranging from 11.5–40.9 kg/ha. Most farmers applied one bag (50 kg) of DAP per acre (0.4 ha) as a basal dose. Many farmers in the region applied urea after irrigation to facilitate moisture evaporation from the fields, which led to reduced nitrogen use efficiency. This practice, however, resulted in a yield penalty in fields where excessive nitrogen doses were applied, leading to the lodging of wheat plants. Out of the surveyed farmers, 22 farmers chose to sow wheat at the end of October, 12 farmers opted to sow their wheat crop between the 1st and 15th of November, while the rest of the farmers sowed after the 15th of November. The cumulative average based on time of sowing revealed that early sowing of wheat subjected the crop to lodging and caused yield penalty, while sowing beyond 15th November recorded less yield due to late sowing beyond the optimum time of sowing. Timely sowing (1–15 November) recorded comparatively more grain yield. High-yield technology in NWPZ To address the challenges of lodging, disease and pest issues, reduced grain yield, high cost of cultivation, etc., there is a need to develop an ideal wheat plant type that combines lodging resistance with a high yield potential of 8.0 t/ ha. Desired characteristics include thicker diameter of the basal wheat culm, thicker stem walls, and robust root density.
