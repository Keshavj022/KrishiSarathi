 It is also recommended to apply microgranular mixture of Sulphur 67 WG+ 14% Zn @ 10 kg/ha and top dressing with Sulphur 90% WG @ 7.5 kg/ha to get more seed yield. Soil treatment: Soil application of Trichoderma viridae @ 2.5 kg / ha mixed with 100 kg FYM or 250 kg castor cake or 250 kg Neem cake before sowing. Seed treatment: Seed treatment with Trichoderma viridae @ 10g/ kg seed or carbendazim 2g/kg seed for the management of fungal diseases. For management of the sucking insects like aphids, thrips etc. seed treatment with Imidacloprid 70 WP @ 7.5g/kg seed is advised. Intercropping and interculture: Due to risky nature of cumin, it is advised to adopt intercropping of cumin and Isabgol in 4:4 ratios. Two interculture (hoeing and weeding) operations required; first at 30-35 DAS and second at 55-60 DAS. Irrigation management: Light irrigation should be applied just after sowing and second irrigation apply after 7 days of first, subsequently irrigations should be applied at 15-25 days’ interval. During grain ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 96 formation stage last irrigation should be given with full amount of water and no need to apply irrigation at maturity stage. Insect-pest management: Aphids: Installation of yellow sticky traps @ 10-12 trap/ha followed by foliar spray with neem oil 3000 ppm @ 3ml/lit. water or NSKE 5% or Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 0.3ml/lit. water Powdery mildew: dusting with sulphur powder @ 25 kg/ha in morning hours is recommended followed by foliar spray with Kerathan (Dinocap) @ 1ml/lit. water at 10-15 days’ interval Blight: Advised to foliar spray with fungicide propiconazole or hexaconazole 5% SC @ 1ml/lit. water Wilt: it is a serious disease in cumin, follow seed treatment and soil treatment with Trichoderma and Bavstin before sowing as suggested above Moisture level of seeds should be maintained below 8.5-9 per cent for long storage Coriander Recommended varieties: Ajmer coriander-1, 2 & 3, Gujarat Coriander-4, Pusa selection 360, Hisar Sugandh, Hisar Anand, RCr-20, 41 & 436 Soils and field preparation: In irrigated conditions sandy to sandy loam soils and in rainfed conditions heavy black soils with increased water holding capacity are suitable for coriander cultivation. Field should be deep ploughed once with disc plough, subsequently 2-3 times ploughing with the help of cultivator and harrow Manure & fertilizers: FYM @ 10-12 ton/ha, For irrigated conditions: 60 kg N: 30 P: 20 kg K and 10 kg ZnSO4 For Rainfed conditions: 30 kg N; 30 kg P Full dose of phosphorus and potash, one third dose of nitrogen ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 97 should be applied before sowing during the field preparation and remaining nitrogenous fertilizer should be applied in two split doses: first dose before sowing and remaining second dose 30-35 DAS with the light irrigation. Soil treatment: Soil application of Trichoderma viridae @ 2.5 kg / ha mixed with 100 kg FYM or 250 kg castor cake or 250 kg Neem cake before sowing.
