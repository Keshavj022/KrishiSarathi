 The country witnessed production of 26.05 million tonnes of pulses during 2022-23. This article deals with scenario of pulse production, import-export status, yield gap and delineates constraints along with strategies to overcome these constraints. Keywords: Pulses, Scenario, Self-sufficiency, Trends Indian Farming 74 (02): 03-06; February 2024 P ulse constitute important dietary constituent for humans and animals because of their richness with proteins (ranging from 20 to 27%, depending upon the crop species) and essential minerals, vitamins and dietary fibres. The protein content of grain legumes is double that of wheat and three times that of rice. Therefore, pulses as a complement to cereals, make one of the best solutions to protein-calorie malnutrition. Beside proteins, pulses are also important source of the 15 essential minerals required by human beings. Due to their diverse uses as atmospheric nitrogen fixing agents, green manure and cover crops, catch crops in short season cropping windows, breakfast grains and ingredients of specialty diets, pulses are an important subject of agricultural, environmental and biotechnological research. To commemorate the importance of pulses in world nutritional security and heath, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United National recognized 2016 as the International Year of Pulses. This celebration has been more important in Indian context where a large majority of population is dependent upon pulses for their protein requirements making this country the largest producer, consumer and importer of pulses in the world. Pulses as a source of nutrition Nutritional value of pulses is quite high as compared to most of the cereals. The nutritional profile of major pulses is described in Table 1. Pulses trends India has been a leader in production as well as consumption of pulses in the world. During the last two years, a production of more Table 1.
