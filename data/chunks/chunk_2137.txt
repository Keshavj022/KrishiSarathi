The cumulative rainfall during this year’s southwest monsoon season has been 7% higher than Long Period Average (LPA). Accordingly, most of the major crop producing states have witnessed normal rainfall. The production of most of the crops for the agricultural year 2020-21 has been estimated higher than their normal production. 1.8.1 The total area coverage under Kharif food grains during 2020-21 is estimated at 712.36 lakh hectares (as per 1st Advance Estimates). The area coverage under nutri / coarse cereals is estimated at 176.17 lakh hectares and under pulses it is estimated at 135.15 lakh hectares. The area under Kharif oilseeds during 2020-21 (as per 1st Advance Estimates) is estimated at 196.61 lakh hectares. A comparative position of production of food grains, oilseeds, sugarcane and cotton during 2020-21 vis-à-vis Normal Average (2014-15 to 2018-19) is given below: Table 5: Production in Kharif 2020-21 and Average (2014-15 to 2018-19) (Million Tonnes) Crop 2020-21 (1stAdvance Estimates) Average (2014- 15 to 2018-19) Absolute Difference(2020-21 over average) Percentage Increase/ decrease (+)/ (-) in 2020-21 over average Food grains 144.52 134.69 9.83 7.30 Oilseeds 25.73 19.83 5.90 29.75 Sugarcane 399.83 360.43 39.40 10.93 Cotton@ 37.12 31.65 5.47 17.28 Jute& Mesta* 9.66 10.49 -0.83 -7.91 @ Production in million bales of 170 kg each * Production in million bales of 180 kg each 1.8.2 As per First Advance Estimates for 2020- 21 (Kharif crops only), total food grain production in the country is estimated at 144.52 million tonnes. The production during 2020- 21 is higher by 9.83 million tonnes than the average food grain production of previous five years’ (2014-15 to 2018-19). 1.8.3 Total production of Kharif rice during 2020-21 is estimated at 102.36 million tonnes. It is higher by 6.70 million tonnes than the previous five years’ average production of 95.
