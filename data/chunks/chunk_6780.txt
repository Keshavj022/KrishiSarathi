 Of these collections, some of interesting specimens are Amanita concentrica, Amanita caeserea, Amanita onusta, Lactarius deliciosus, Cysclocybe aegerita, Scleroderma citrinum, Ramaria aurea, Chlorophyllum molybdites etc. Culturing of 8 specimens namely Coprinus comatus, Pleurotus sp., Cordyceps militaris, Isaria cicadae, Ramaria sp., Ganoderma, Flammulina sp. and Herecium sp. was done. All the specimens had been deposited in herbarium at ICAR- Directorate of Mushroom Research, Solan (HP). Fruiting in identified genotypes of longan Oil palm: An oil palm cross progeny number 483 (599NATP × 33D) promising for more oil to bunch ratio (21.37%) was identified. Orchids: A long stalked Paphiopedilum insigne germplasm NOAC- 235) was identified. In addition, a floriferous germplasm of Dendrobium chrysanthum (NRCOP-21054) was identified. Basil: A total of four promising basil germplasm accessions were identified having different quality traits as described hereunder. DLB-7: Lemon basil (Ocimum × africanum) has broad ovate leaf and rich in citral A (40.59%) and citral B (48.59%) content. DLB-10: Lemon basil (Ocimum × africanum) has maximum leaf size and herbage yield (298 q/ ha). Quick response (QR) coded gene bank established: A QR coded gene bank exclusively for wild genetic resources of banana was established at ICAR-National Research Centre for Banana, Tiruchirappalli. This is the first of its kind in India which conserves the genetic diversity of Musa spp. (11 no.) and for identifying resistant sources to various biotic and abiotic stresses in banana.
