 Total expenditure incurred during culture period of seven months was 92,940 and total revenue generated from sale of fish and prawn was 1,43,420. Hence, the net profit achieved from carp-scampi polyculture from 0.1 ha pond was 50,480 in seven months. The profit earned from sale of CIFA-GI Scampi was 32,000 which accounts for 2/3rd of the total profit ( 50,480) earned in carp-scampi polyculture system. The present trial establishes the advantage of CIFA-GI Scampi in increasing production as well as profit. Farmer showing the harvest of CIFA-GI Scampi and carp from the carp-scampi polyculture system successfully developed for P. setnai and P. nigripinnis, with M/F sex ratio of 1:1. Similarly, breeding technique were standardized for two endangered species viz. Dawkinsiatam braparniei, the Tambraparniei barb and Dawkinsia arulius, the Arulius barb. Two backyard recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) models of rearing tanks size 3 and 7 m3 with production capacity of 30 kg per m3 were designed, fabricated and validated for small-scale farming of icar annual report 2022-23 71 Fish Improvement rainbow trout by the farmers of hill states to reduce the initial cost of investment. When rainbow trout fingerlings of 50 g and 70 g were reared in tanks of 3 and 7 m3, respectively, attained marketable size of 700 g in 150 and 180 days, respectively in both the systems. The techno-economic feasibility study showed that both systems had pay-back period of 2-3 crops (1-2 year) and water usage was 908-1,082 L per kg fish produced, which is 50-100 times lesser than the flow- through system. ‚ùë icar annual report 2022-23 72 Plant Genetic Resources Germplasm exploration: During the period under report, a total of 18 explorations were undertaken and 890 accessions (450 cultivated and 440 wild) were collected from parts of Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jammu, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. Collected germplasms included unique landraces of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables and germplasms of wild edible fruits and crop wild relatives. Germplasms of fruits, viz. Aegle marmelos (43), Annona reticulata (17), Buchanania lanzan (37), Carissa carandus (3), Citrus medica (6), Citrus aurantium (4), Citrus macroptera (4), Citrus grandis (9), Citrus jambhiri (14), Citrus reticulata (8), Diospyros melanoxylon (5), Garcinia pedunculata (5), G. xanthochymus (3), G. lanceifolia (2), Moringa concanensis (54), Moringa oleifera (41) and wild relatives of cultivated crops, viz. Oryza sativa f. spontanea (19), O. nivara (10), O. rufipogon (19), Cajanus scarabaeoides (12), Abelmoschus tetraphyllus (19), Abelmoschus tuberculatus (11), Abelmoschus ficulneus (1) and Luffa acutangula var. amara (7) etc. were the significant collections.
