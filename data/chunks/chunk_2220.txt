 The list of new batches (Table 6), including the Brachiaria hybrids (apomictic) developed by CIAT, which do not have any IPR and royalty payment issues, is ready for shipment. Their import permit is being processed by IGFRI. This batch also includes the material that has only 100 seeds in stock, and all the material meets higher bio-mass, shorter duration and higher nutritive quality parameters. ICAR-CGIAR | ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 15 Cassava: CIAT has sequenced using Illumina technology more than 1000 accessions and 500 breeding lines, leading to the identification of crop’s sub-populations and family structure, and that has significantly changed the breeding strategy. CIAT has in the past supplied about 120 accessions and 164 SSR marker tested pre-breeding lines to CTCRI to develop cassava mosaic virus resistant, nutrient efficient and drought tolerant varieties for India. Seven Cassava varieties developed using this material have been locally released and are widely grown in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Some varieties also have low post harvest deterioration levels. The demand for high waxy starch containing cassava varieties for industrial uses is also being fulfilled by CIAT. As of now from the CIAT accessions supply CTCRI maintains 7 sources of waxy starch; 3 varietal sources of small-granule starch; 10 landraces and 15 pre-breeding lines with PPD tolerance; 150 sources of high b-carotenoid, 50 pre-breeding lines with resistance to whiteflies, 3 sources of stable dry-matter content, a pre-breeding population for Table 6: List of new batches of forage seeds ready for shipment S.N.
