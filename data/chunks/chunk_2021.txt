 With estimated global losses reaching 20–30 billion US dollars (Blum, 2021) and approximately INR 7165.51 crores in India (Bansal and Gupta, 2009), its impact extends beyond financial losses. Mastitis affects the quantity and quality of milk produced and jeopardizes the overall udder health of dairy animals. Poor sanitation and hygiene practices contribute significantly to the flare-up of mastitic pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus uberis (Sinha et al., 2014). The incidence and prevalence of mastitis cases are rising, paralleling the increasing milk productivity of dairy animals globally. Krishnamoorthy et al. (2021) reported a worldwide prevalence of 42% for subclinical mastitis (SCM) and 15% for clinical mastitis (CM), and in India, these figures were even higher at 45% for SCM and 18% for CM. The commonly used mastitis detection methods involve somatic cell count estimation and the California Mastitis Test (CMT). While advanced diagnostic techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) exist, they are costly and require specialized infrastructure and skilled technicians. In this context, a rapid, noninvasive cow-side diagnostic tool is essential for assessing udder health, and infrared thermography (IRT) emerges as a promising solution. Infrared thermography, developed initially for military and medical purposes, utilizes the principle that every object above absolute zero emits infrared radiation. This technology, characterized by its simplicity, effectiveness, on-site applicability, and noninvasiveness, has the potential to revolutionize mastitis detection in dairy animals. The ability of IRT to capture and convert infrared radiation into thermal images allows for the visualization of temperature variations on the udder's surface. IRT is a simple, effective, on-site, and noninvasive tool that uses surface body temperature to generate images without causing radiation exposure. Maximum IR temperature and its change are preferred in scientific study purposes rather than average and minimum IRT of the external body surface as maximum IRT is better associated with differences during lactation variables, behavioral responses of emotions, and metabolism (Byrne et al., 2019, Uddin et al., 2019 and Uddin et al., 2020). Assessment of infectious diseases (Menesatti et al., 2004) and estimation of welfare status among farm animals (Stewart et al., 2005, 2007) using IRT is practical (Kníˇzkova et al., 2007). A minute change in the udder skin surface temperature can be assessed using sensitive IR cameras. Thus, IRT is effective as a convenient portable tool in livestock management. Researchers have used IRT to assess the udder skin surface temperature (USST) changes in healthy and Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report 9.4.
