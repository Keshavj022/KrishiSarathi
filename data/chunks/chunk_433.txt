 Indian Farming 6 October 2023 of high pH, high calcareousness and low organic carbon. Char lands (Diara lands) are comparatively more fertile than active flood plains and meander plains. Soils on Char lands (Diara lands) are moderately suitable for wheat, maize, rabi- pulses, rabi vegetables if raised bedded farming system is adopted. Orchard plantations may also be encouraged in upper terraces of Burhi Gandak river using raised bedded grass vegetative strips (lemon grass) as barrier. The ox-bow lakes in meander plains can be used for organized bund fishery and may also be encouraged for Makkhana cultivation for boosting economic returns of the farmers. Apart from ox-bow lakes, Makkhana cultivation can also be promoted in scattered water bodies in other parts of the block considering its nutritional quality and high market value in the state as well as in other parts of the country. Although, sugarcane has been grown sporadically in the block, its economic returns are declining day-by-day. Its market value is also deprived because of lack of industries in the region. Organized bund fishery, integrated paddy-fishery and Makkhana can be the good replacements of sugarcane in the region. Enhancing livelihood security through impact assessment Based on constraints and potentialities of soils and land suitability assessment, alternate land use options were suggested Table 2.
