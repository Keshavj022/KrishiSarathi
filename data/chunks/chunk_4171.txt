 Effect of honey bee (Apis cerana) pollination on different parameters of seed production in vegetables (Source: Pratap 1992, Verma 1994) Table 2.

March–April 2023 109 soil conservation and fertility, environment preservation and biodiversity maintenance, income generation and food security, and rural people’s way of life all are impacted by beekeeping. Beekeeping significantly increases the amount of food that is produced by pollinating more food crops. Beekeeping also helps to protect forests and promotes environmentally friendly activities. In terms of apiculture, the least visible livelihood outcome is the pollination of both wild and cultivated crops. According to a 2016 international study by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, the annual value of the world’s food production that directly depends on pollination ranges from $235 to $577 billion. India is currently the fifth-largest producer of honey. The Punjab state alone supplies more than 39% of the nation’s total honey production. In general, a colony/hive produces 20-50 kg of honey annually. There is also potential for a 35% increase in honey production per colony. In almost all societies, honey is also used as food or traditional medicine. Beekeepers and other residents of rural areas utilise honey and beeswax to produce candles, which they sell to earn a higher profit. Bee venom is used as medicine for treatment of arthritis. Additionally, bees produce pollen, propolis, and royal jelly, which in some cases can be harvested, sold, and transformed into secondary goods to improve people’s livelihoods. Economic analysis of beekeeping In view of the increasing demand of honey in the international world market, the possibilities of beekeeping are limitless, so that by creating employment opportunities for the people in rural areas, along with increasing the income of the farmers, problems like malnutrition can be solved by this venture up to some extent. Apart from the pollination by the honey bees, other economic return and their analysis from this beneficial fauna are enumerated below. One hive will produce around 30 kg of honey each year; therefore, 50 colonies will produce 1,500 kg of honey. Table 2 provides the economic information (income-expenditure) for 50 colonies of apiaries where it is evident that from 50 colonies of honey bees approximate INR.2,22,600/- may be earned annually.
