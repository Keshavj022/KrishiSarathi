 The orchard was of about 3 ha area, at 2,400 m above msl, which was established 10 years ago. The landscape is very steep, with a slope of 70- 75%. About 500 apple trees were planted along the visually-observed contours at a spacing of 3- 6 m. The trees are being fertilized regularly with chemical fertilizers and FYM. The orchard is completely rainfed. Soil characterization Soil samples were collected at eight locations, i.e. six in the SALT (orchard) area up to a depth of 60 cm at 15 cm depth increment, and two in non- SALT (non-orchard) area at two depths at 30 cm depth interval. The soil samples for each depth were thoroughly mixed and a composite sample was prepared. The composite soil samples were analysed in duplicate for texture (International Pipette method), organic carbon (Dichromate oxidation method of Walkley and Black), available N (Alkaline permanganate method), Olsen's P, exchangeable K (Ammonium acetate method), pH (1:2.5 soil:water suspension) and particle density (Pycnometer method). Soil-moisture retention of disturbed soil samples (soil passed through 2 mm sieve) was determined at saturation, -30 and - 1500 kPa water potential, using Pressure plate apparatus. Bulk density was determined using 3 cm long and 5.6 cm diameter metal cores, by taking soil core from the middle portion of each soil layer. The soil was gravelly and medium in texture. The bulk density of soil varied from 1.14 to 1.47 mg/m3. The average particle density of soil was 2.61 mg/m3. The porosity of soil was thus high, especially in the top 30 cm soil layer. Consequently, the soil was highly permeable for water. The infiltration rate of soil (after 6 hr of initiation) varied from 5379 and 7005 mm/day (Table 1). The soil was acidic in reaction irrespective of the SALT (orchard) and non-SALT (non-orchard) area. In the SALT area the organic carbon was in the medium range in the top 45 cm depth, but low in 45-60 cm depth. In the non-SALT area, the organic carbon was low. The nutrient status was medium for available N, high for Olsen's P and low to medium for exchangeable K at both the locations (Table 2). Field mapping The contour lines were drawn and the marking of each tree was done to prepare the actual location of the trees. The line-transect method was used to calculate and mark the trees and with the help of a frame the actual contour lines were Table 1.
