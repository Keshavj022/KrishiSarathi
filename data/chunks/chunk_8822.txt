 It has showed resistance against bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) and leaf crinkle. Seeds are medium bold (38 g/100- seed) and are variegated red in colour. Nimbecidine 0.2%, Achook 0.5%, neemgold 0.5%, all neem-based pesticides, are superior in controlling major insect-pests. ET 8497, ET 8430, ET 8411, ET 8416, ET 8447, PJ 164631 and Vermelho 2152 have showed resistance to BCMV. Rajmash grains infected with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum placed at the hypocotyl region of the plant has been found most effective technique for screening resistant genotypes in pot culture. FIELDPEA IPF 27, a pedigree selection from Rachna × Kiran, has been identified for eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. Besides resistance to powdery mildew and tolerance to rust, it has yield potential of 2.8-3.0 tonnes/ha. Its seeds are white, round and medium bold (19 g/100-seed). HUDP 17, HUDP 16, DMR 38, IPF 27, IPF 14, KPMR 569, Pant P 11, DDR 41, DMR 7 and DMR 45 have been identified as donors against rust and DDR 49, DDR 39, HUP 2, HUDP 15 and DMR 38 against pod-borer. Pendimethalin at 0.75 kg/ha as pre-emergence herbicide coupled with hand weeding 30 days after sowing increased mean yield of dwarf peas by about 30% over control. JP 9, NIC 20395, DPFPD 62, KPMR 8, JP 181, JP 50 A, K 9, KSP 11, KSP 22, KPMR 65-1 and PM 5 showed stable resistance against rust and powdery mildew. Two sprays of zinc sulphate (0.1%) were effective against rust in fieldpea, besides being highly safe and eco-friendly. ● ●● ●● IIPR 96-4 rajmash, showing superior yield performance over check PDR 14, has been identified for eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa. ● ●● ●● Identified IPF 27 fieldpea with a yield potential of 2.8-3.0 tonnes/ha. ● Two sprays of ZnSO4 (0.1%) were effective against rust, besides being highly safe and eco-friendly. IPF 27 fieldpea is a pedigree selection from Rachna x Kiran. It shows resistance to powdery mildew and tolerance to rust, with a yield potential of 2.8-3.0 tonnes/ha. It has been identified for eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 36 LATHYRUS Lathyrus lines RLS 1186, IPLY 99-7 and IPLy 99-9 have been identified for resistance against powdery mildew. Pre-cooking water soaking of decorticated split seed (dal) of lathyrus for 4-6 hr resulted in 27-30% losses of β-oxalyl diamino propionic acid (ODAP), a neurotoxic compound present in lathyrus. ARID LEGUMES Crop Improvement Mothbean RMO 435, maturing in 62-65 days, with yield of about 500 kg/ha has been identified for rainfed areas. It has field tolerance to yellow mosaic virus. Clusterbean RGC 1017, identified for Rajasthan, Haryana and Gujarat, matures in 92-96 days. It shows 18% higher average yield over national check RGC 936. It contains 34.1% endosperm, 31.0% crude protein and 29.4% galactomannan gum. Breeder seed of clusterbean RGC 936, RGC 197, RGC 986, RGC 1003 and GAUG 34 have been produced to the tune of 17.
