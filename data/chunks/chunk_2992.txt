Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years): 1. ROSE • A total of 780 accessions of varieties belonging to various classes of roses i.e. Hybrid Tea, Floribunda, Miniature and Climbing groups were collected and maintained at Delhi, Bhubaneswar, Ludhiana, Hessaraghatta, Ranchi, Pantnagar and Udaipur centers • Rose cv. Pusa Gauvav’ (developed by IARI, New Delhi) was found to be suitable for cut flower production under Bhubaneswar conditions. • For loose flower production rose cvs. ‘Neelambari’ and ‘Arunima’ were found promising whereas 'Banjaran' proved to be the best for garden display under Bhubaneswar agroclimatic conditions. • The exotic varieties of rose namely ‘Skyline’, ‘Nobelesse’ and ‘Golden Gate’ under Pune conditions performed better than the other exotic varieties. • HT rose Pusa Gaurav and Floribunda rose Arunima have been found performing well at most of the centers. • For commercial cultivation of rose, 400:200:200 ppm NPK/plant/week were recommended. • Application of 300‐400 ppm nitrogen, 200 ppm each of phosphorus and potash per week to the plants of rose cv. ‘Montezuma’ growing under protected conditions was found to be best with regard to number of flowers per plant (56.80) as well as size of flowers under Bhubaneswar conditions. • Application of 400:200 ppm NPK in rose cv. ‘First Red’ growing under polyhouse recorded maximum plant height, number of flowers per plant (40.55) and stem length (80‐50 cm). • Pulsing the cut flowers of rose with aluminium sulphate (300 ppm) + sucrose (3%) followed by the treatment with a holding solution consisting of aluminium suplhate (300 ppm) and sucrose (1.5%) increased the postharvest life under Ludhiana, Pune and Lucknow conditions.
