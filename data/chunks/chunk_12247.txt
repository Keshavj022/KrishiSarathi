Selection of field/land preparation (Type of : Flat fertile soil, pre-sowing irrigation followed topography, soil condition, tillage operations for by ploughing with disc harrow, tiller and leveller at seed bed etc.) field capacity for optimum field conditions 3. Seed treatment (Recommended chemical with doses) : Vitavax @ 2.0 g/kg of seed 4. Sowing time (Optimum sowing period) : November 10-20 5. Seed rate/sowing method—line sowing with row-to- : 100 kg/ha line sowing with row-to-row distance of row and plant-to-plant distance 20cm and plant-to-plant 5 cm 6. Fertilizer doses and time of fertilizer’s application : 150:60:40 (N:P:K); 1/3 N at sowing and 2/3 at first (Type and quantity of fertilizers) node stage i.e. 35-40 DAS 7. Weed control (Name of weedicide(s) with dosages : For the control of broad-leaved weeds 2,4-D at 500 and timing of mechanical weeding, if any) g/ha or metsulfuron at 4 g/ha or carfentrazone at 20 g/ha can be sprayed using about 250 litres of water/ha •For the control of grasses isoproturon at 1,000 g or clodinafop at 60 g or fenoxaprop 100g or sulfosulfuron at 25 g/ha should be used. In isoproturon resistant P. minor infested areas clodinafop or fenoxaprop or sulfosulfuron can be used • For the control of complex weed flora, combination of isoproturon with 2,4-D or metsulfuron or sulfosulfuron with metsulfuron can be applied at 30-35 DAS at sufficient soil moisture 8. Major diseases and pests control (Type of pest and : The variety is resistant to stripe and leaf rust and disease with name of chemicals and dosages and other diseases. However, for stripe rust, leaf rust, timing of application) Karnal bunt and powdery mildew, apply propiconazole/ triademefone/tebucanazole at 0.1% (1ml/litre) as foliar spray twice after disease appearance at 15 days interval 9.
