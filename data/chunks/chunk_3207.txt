2%) + Methyldemeton (0.1%) minimized the incidence of Phytophthora www.icar.org.in 88 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science blight, Cercospora leaf spot, phyllody and leaf curl diseases and proved to be the most effective control measure against these diseases. • Spray of Trichoderma viride (0.2%) was most effective in the management of Phytophthora blight. • Seed treatment with Trichoderma viride 0.4 % + soil application of Tviride @ 2.5 kg/ha) minimized Phytophthora blight and Macrophomina stem/root rot and gave highest seed yield. • One spray of Chlorothalonil (0.2%) minimized the incidence and proved to be most effective for the control of Cercospora leaf spot and Alternaria leaf spot and increased the grain yield. • Two sprays of Propiconazol were most effective to minimize incidence of Alternaria leaf spot and powdery mildew, whereas Tridemorph was most effective to minimize Cercospora and Alternaria leaf spot. Chlorothalonil minimized the incidence of Alternaria leaf spot. • IDM module comprising seed treatment with Thiram (0.2%) + Carbendazim 50 WP (0.1 %) + spray of Mancozeb (0.25%) + Endosulfan (0.07%) at 30‐40 and 45‐55 days after sowing minimized the incidence of powdery mildew, Alternaria leaf spot, Cercospora leaf spot, Phytophthora blight, phyllody and Macrophomina stem/root rot diseases and gave higher seed yield. • Solarization + Mancozeb (0.25%) spray was most effective to manage of Phytophthora blight and yield increase. • Soil incorporation of neem cake @ 500 kg/ha + seed treatment with T viride (0.4%) + soil application of T viride @ 2.5 kg/ha was most effective to reduce the incidence of Macrophomina stem/root rot and gave the highest seed yield. www.icar.org.in 89 2002 ‐ 2007 All India Coordinated Research Project on Soybean 1.

Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): • Twenty soybean varieties viz. MAUS 71, MAUS 61‐2, MAUS 61, RAUS 5, JS 93‐05, MAUS 81, Palam Soya, PS 1241, TAMS 38, SL 525, DS 228, Co‐3, PRS‐1, DS 97‐12, JS 75‐60, PS 1347, DS 98‐14, Himso 1588, RKS 18 and TAMS 98‐21 were released/notified for different agro climatic regions. Two varieties viz. SL 688 for North Plain Zone and JS 97‐52 for North Eastern Zone have been identified. So far, a total of 93 varieties of soybean have been developed under the AICRP on Soybean. • Problem of pod shattering in soybean is largely solved by development of several shattering‐resistant varieties. • Early maturing varieties helped in increasing the system efficiency of soybean based cropping system and also in extending soybean to nontraditional areas. • New location‐specific biotic menaces viz.
