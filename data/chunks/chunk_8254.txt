 Goat Production Management Information System (GMIS) provided an efficient and effective way of data recording, data analysis, monitoring and evaluation etc. Various sub-modules are regularly modified/ updated as per the feedback received from 18 co-ordinating units of AICRP on Goat Improvement. The website is hosted and currently running with URL “http://pcgoatcirg.icar.gov.in/”. The increase in body weight at 12-month age over the units varied from 0.38 to 32.12%. Similarly, the increase in milk yield at 90 days varied from 3.35 to 48.85% across the units. The average pashmina production of Changthangi goats was 265 g. Preventive health care contributed in increasing the population growth and also improving the farmer’s income by 22 to 35%. A higher population growth amongst breeds resulted in increased selection intensity, thus realized genetic gains were higher. Animals with improved productivity were produced at Farm units and distributed to different agencies for breed improvement as well as for up-gradation of local germplasm. The field units also distributed improved bucks to adopted farmers. AICRP units also conducted 101 training programmes for skill development in goat husbandry. improvement of farmers’ flock during the year. About 126 Madras Red rams and 38 Magra rams were distributed to registered sheep farmers for field flock improvement. Breedable Madras Red ewes (6,176) of 115 sheep farmers and 4,744 breedable Magra ewes of 98 sheep farmers were registered for performance recording and genetic improvement. Mega Sheep Seed Project: The project has five co-operating units, namely, BAU, Ranchi for Chhotanagpuri breed; KVAFSU, Bidar for Mandya breed; TANUVAS, Chennai for Mecheri breed; RAJUVAS, Bikaner for Sonadi breed; and ICAR- Performance of farm flocks Breed/ Annual Tupping Annual Overall Sale Particulars GFY (kg) (%) lambing (%) survivability (%) Rams Ewe Marwari 1.526 97.66 91.42 98.20 67 25 Muzaffarnagri 1.262 100 90.70 97.50 39 10 Deccani 0.951 95.95 93.77 92.11 80 21 Magra 2.308 94.68 87.04 99.01 130 27 Nellore NA 97.52 85.89 91.73 62 0 Performance of farmers’ flocks Breed/Particulars Average body weights (kg) Annual lambing Distribution Birth 3 month 6 month 12 month (%) of rams Madras Red 2.55 10.59 15.66 21.13 86.82 126 Magra 2.60 16.15 22.33 30.08 75.75 38 GFY: Greasy Fleece Yield LIVESTOCK IMPROVEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 58 and 40 weeks of age; and MCW0058 on body weights at 24 and 28 weeks of age. Improvement of poultry germplasm: At DPR, Hyderabad, PD-1 (Vanaraja male line), GML (Gramapriya male line), PD-2 (Vanaraja female line) and PD-3 (Brown egg layer line) were maintained for use in developing rural chicken varieties. In PD-2 line, age at sexual maturity was 161.5 days, which was lower than that of the last generation. The phenotypic and genetic response for part period egg mass up to 40 weeks of age was 210 g and 65.8 g/generation, respectively, over last five generations.
