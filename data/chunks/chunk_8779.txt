Strengthening of eight Zonal Coordinating Units and 29 Directorates of Extension Education at the State Agricultural Universities by providing modern IT facilities, and approval for the start of four new Agricultural Technology Information Centres (ATICs) are significant achievements under Innovations in Technology Dissemination programme of the NATP. In the context of changing global agricultural scenario due to globalization and liberalization, the Council has identified 30 thrust areas for the X Five Year Plan which include agricultural biotechnology, genomics research and transgenics, bio-informatics, conservation of natural resources and agro-biodiversity, crop improvement and management, post-harvest technology and management, animal and fisheries improvement and health management, agri-business management, agricultural human resource development and strengthening of research extension mechanism. A cropping/farming system approach has been envisaged, and effective partnerships with advanced institutions in India and abroad are being fostered for the technological capacity enhancement.
