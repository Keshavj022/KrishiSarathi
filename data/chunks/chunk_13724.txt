 Total weed count (maize and wheat) During the summer and winter seasons, tillage and weed super- vision experiments had a signiﬁcant (p = 0.05) impact on ﬂuctua- tion of the pooled total weed density (TWD) (No. m2) (Fig. 1). Lower TWD was recorded during 30 DAS in maize crop which in- creased as crop growth period advance. However, total density of the weeds reduced as crop approaches to the harvesting. During initial crop growth phase, conventional tillage (CT-CT) had higher total weed density compared to the conservation pro- duction system (ZTR-ZTR) and zero tillage (ZT-ZT). In comparison to zero tillage treatments without residue applied at 60 and 90 DAS of maize, the TWD was considerably lower when residue was applied in combination with zero tillage. Maximum TWD was recorded at 60 DAS; which was lower in ZTR-ZTR compared to ZT-ZT and CT-CT which were comparable to each other. ZTR- ZTR and ZT-ZTR were statistically comparable with one another and had lower TWD. IWM-IWM had signiﬁcantly lower TWD dur- Table 2 The impact of weed management practices and tillage on the number of weeds per square meter in a crop of maize (pooled data).
