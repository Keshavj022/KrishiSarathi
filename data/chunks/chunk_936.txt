 SUMMARY The gender-sensitive agri-horti livelihood enhancement model has improved the livelihood of the farm women through interventions like cultivation of high yielding varieties of paddy, pulse and vegetables in an improved scientific approach. The advanced cultivation of such crops which up-scaled the livelihoods were widely adopted among the farm women of the region, which also impacted their socio-economic conditions. The livelihood enhancement model has facilitated multi-fold to augment the overall income of the women farmer producer organisation (FPO) named Ananya Farmers Producer Company Limited and hence, sustained their livelihood. As a result of socio-economic upliftment of the farm women group, a significant reduction in the identified gender gap was realized in the project area, which ultimately aided in promoting empowerment of women farmers of the region. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: lipi.ciwa@ gmail.com On-farm trials of improved high yielding vegetable varieties Table 2.
