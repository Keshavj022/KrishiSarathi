 The attempts at simultaneous diagnosis of multiple nutrient stresses and their effective remediation are likely to pave the way to develop a robust system of Khasi mandarin production, besides other collateral efforts of arresting citrus decline would be hand-in-gloves effort to perch Khasi mandarin in Northeast India, a comfortable home in years to come.

Vegetables are cultivated under homestay and mixed commercial systems with various production systems depending on high, mid, and foothills. The region is the wealthiest reservoir of genetic variability of vegetables such as leafy vegetables, tomato, brinjal, chilli, Indian bean, winged bean, velvet bean, tree tomato, tree bean, cucurbits, dioscorea, colocasia, etc. These crops are an integral part of the dietary system of local communities and are grown abundantly in their Jhum land or kitchen garden as mixed cropping.
