 Here, we delve into some inspiring success stories that showcase the power and potential of natural farming in fostering resilient, eco- From soil to success: Journey with natural farming Mohan Gangaram Patel, a farmer from Lohari village, Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh, has achieved success in natural farming with the support of Krishi Vigyan Kendra. Despite his limited education and landholding, he embraced KVK’s assistance, transitioning to natural farming practices. With guidance, he focused on cultivating Chickpea Var. RVG 204 over 0.40 hectares, showcasing the effectiveness of natural techniques like seed treatment with beejamrit and manual weeding. This shift led to a notable increase in yield from 16.25 to 21.25 quintals per hectare, significantly boosting income. Mohan’s success underscores the benefits of jeevamrit and amritpani application, reducing dependency on costly inputs. While facing challenges like labour availability, his story highlights the viability of natural farming. Recommending the replication of such models among other farmers, it suggests exploring high-value crops and establishing markets for naturally produced goods, fostering sustainability and economic growth. Leading the green revolution in Burhanpur with natural farming In the district of Burhanpur, Madhya Pradesh, farmer Prabhakar Sitaram Chaudhary has emerged as a torchbearer of sustainable agriculture, showcasing the process of natural farming. Engaging with the Krishi Vigyan Kendra during 2022-2023, he embarked on a journey that not only transformed his yields but also revolutionized his approach to farming. A medium landholding farmer with a three-hectare plot, two indigenous cows, and a high school education, he implemented innovative interventions such as jivamrut, bijamrut, nimastra, bramhastra, and dashparni ark at regular intervals. Under the natural farming paradigm, he cultivated gram (RVG-203) on 0.4 hectares, achieving a commendable production of 14.1 q/ ha. The KVK played a pivotal role, providing training, capacity building, and essential inputs for the demonstrations. A careful comparison between natural farming and conventional farming practices revealed remarkable success. While natural farming incurred a lower cost of cultivation at `37,950, this resulted in a higher net income of `25,590 and a better benefit-cost ratio of 1.67, signifying the economic viability of natural farming. The success story extends beyond financial metrics. Prabhakar attests to the reduction in fertilizer and insecticide costs, praising the environmental and economic benefits of natural farming. Despite facing challenges related to manual labour for input preparation and application, he recognizes the potential for further expansion of natural farming in his fields. The story culminates with a vision for the future as Chaudhary plans to extend the adoption of natural farming to other crops, making him a beacon of sustainable agriculture in the region.
