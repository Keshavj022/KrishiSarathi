 For weed management, at least one or two hand weeding required- first 20-25 days after sowing and second on 40-45 days after sowing and do intercultural operation followed by earthing up. If the field is infested with motha, apply 2,4-D amine salt 58 SL@1.0L/ha by dissolving in 375 litres of water at 20-25 days after sowing. Regularly monitor the field to collect and destroy egg masses of fall armyworm from leaves. Egg masses are covered with hairs and are easily visible. Spray the crop with chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC @ 0.4ml/ litre of water or emamectin benzoate 5SG @0.4 g/litre Pulses Gram To obtain higher yield, cultivate improved and disease resistant variety of chickpea. Timely sown varieties: RSG 44, Pusa 329, Pusa 362, DCP-92-3, GCP105, KWR108, BG1003, Vijay, Pragati, Pant gram3, Pant gram 4, HK4, Birsa chana 3, Sadabahar; and Late sown varieties: Pusa 372, KPG 59 (Uday). Apply pre sowing irrigation for good germination and early crop establishment. Complete the sowing between mid-October to mid- November. Seed rate for small seeded is 75-80 kg/ha and for bold seeded 100 kg/ha. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 175 Sowing of gram crop at a spacing of 30cmX10cm for small seed and 45cmX10cm for bold seed at depth of 8-10cm because dip sown crop has less incidence of wilt disease. Before sowing seed should be first treated with fungicide carbendazim @ 2g/kg seed then treated with insecticide chlorpyrifos20EC@ 8ml/kg seed and lastly treated with Rhizobium culture @ 10g/kg seed 2-3 hours before sowing. Apply recommended dose of fertilizer in pulses are 20 kg N (45 kg urea), 40 kg P2O5 (250 kg SSP) and 20 kg K (36 kg muriate of potash) at the time of sowing of seed through seed cum fertilizer drill. In absence of winter rainfall, give one irrigation at pod development stage (75 DAS). No irrigation is given at flowering time. Lentil Best time for sowing of lentil is mid-October to mid-November and it ensures good crop stand and also escapes from the attack of insect pest and diseases. Delayed sown crop is more prone to wilt diseases and too early sowing results in excessive, vegetative growth and poor setting of pods. Cultivate improved varieties like PL 406, PL 639, K 75 (Mallika), HUL 57, NDL 2, WBL 58, WBL 77, PL 777-12 (Arun), IPL 406, Narendra Masoor 1, BR 25, KLS 218 and sowing to be done at 30cmX10 cm spacing at 4-5cm depth. The optimum seed rate required for lentil is 30-35 kg/ha for sole crop and 50-60 kg/ha for paira cropping. Treat the seed 2-3 days before sowing with fungicide carbendazim @ 2g/kg seed then with insecticide chlorpyriphos @ 2ml/kg seed and lastly 2-3 hours before sowing with Rhizobium culture @ 10g/ kg. Apply 2-3 MT FYM/ha at the time of final field preparation. Use recommended dose of fertilizer in pulses are 20 kg N (45 kg urea), ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 176 40 kg P2O5 (250 kg SSP) and 20 kg K (36 kg muriate of potash) at the time of sowing of seed through seed cum fertilizer drill.
