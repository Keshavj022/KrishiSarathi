 Some of the promising introductions were: wheat with excellent grain quality and resistance to Lr, Yr, Snb genes, imported for heat stress tolerance studies (EC 919308) from USA, wheat with increased amylose and resistant starch (EC 915108) from USA; paddy with superior drought and cold tolerance (EC 900415- 904276) from the Philippines, CMS and restorer lines (EC 904493-904518) from the Philippines, bacterial leaf blight tolerant, blast tolerant and drought tolerant lines (EC 907578-912489) from China, insect tolerant, early maturing, lodging and drought tolerant lines (EC 906093-906130); finger millet with high iron, calcium and zinc content (EC 915296-915344) from Kenya; semi-determinate tomato lines with multiple disease resistance against gray leaf spot, fusarium wilt (race 2), tomato mosaic virus and tomato yellow leaf curl virus (EC 904110-904117) from AVRDC Taiwan; Macadamia nuts with good flavor, soft texture, early and heavy bearing trait (EC 896468-896475) from USA and rubber resistant to South American leaf blight disease (SALB) (EC 898375-898377) from Ghana. A total of 18,776 germplasm accessions were characterized and evaluated at NBPGR, New Delhi and its regional stations. Screening against biotic and abiotic stresses in different crops was done in 2,911 and 787 accessions, respectively. Biochemical evaluation of 1,693 accessions was undertaken in different crops for oil content, fatty acid profile, protein, sugar, minerals, amino acids, antioxidants and active principles. Multi trait near-infrared spectroscopy prediction model was developed for oil, protein, fatty acids, lysine and methionine in amaranth and buckwheat to enable rapid screening of germplasm. Germplasm field days were organized on wheat, barley, oilseeds and maize at New Delhi; okra at Thrissur and kharif pulses at Shimla. A total of 7,343 accessions were supplied for research use and crop improvement within the country. Plant quarantine: A total of 47,432 samples of imported germplasm including transgenic and trial materials were processed for quarantine clearance. Out of the total 914 pest infected samples, 804 were salvaged using appropriate treatments. Important interceptions include: fungi, viz. Tilletia barclayana on Oryza sativa from China, Dendryphion penicillatum on Papaver somniferum from UK, Puccinia carthami on Carthamus spp. from the USA, Fusarium solani on Lycopersicon esculentum from Germany, Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris on Brassica from Germany, Verticillium albo-atrum on Calendula officinalis, Peronospora manshurica on Glycine max from Costa Rica, Phoma sorghina on Momordica charantia from Thailand; nematodes, viz. Aphelenchoides besseyi on Oryza sativa from China, Japan, Philippines and USA; insects, viz.
