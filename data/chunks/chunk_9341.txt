Such conservation is based on the slowed growth of cultures in highly controlled in-vitro conditions. In-vitro conservation strategies can be technically divided into two categories (1) In vitro active genebank (IVAG) or tissue culture repository and (2) In vitro base genebank (IVBG) or cryobank. The former genebank is for short to medium-term storage of germplasm using shoot cultures or plantlets under slow or normal growth procedures, but the cultures are maintained under the growing state. While cryobank is meant for the long-term conservation PGR, usually using embryos (somatic or zygotic), shoot tips and pollen under suspended growth. Cryopreservation: conservation of cultures (tissues, organs, pollen, cultures, or seed in liquid nitrogen at -150 to -196 oC. The status of germplasm conserved under the in-vitro bank and cryo bank at ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi is provided in Table 5.

It is particularly required for forestry species, species belonging to a complex ecosystems, endangered, and wild relatives of crop plants. There are mainly two approaches for In-situ conservation (a) ecosystem approach (biosphere reserves) and (b) habitat approach (national parks, sacred groves, gene sanctuaries). In situ conservation is very difficult to monitor and to keep track since it involves continued habitat maintenance. Although the present article is on agro-biodiversity as a whole, the following examples and case studies are primarily on adopting Gandhian principles for plant genetic resources (PGR) conservation and management which are for illustrative purposes only and by far reflective of all such instances. 4.2.
