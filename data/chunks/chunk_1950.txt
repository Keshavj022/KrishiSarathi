 Each node has a copy of the ledger, and there is no central authority controlling the entire system. Once data is recorded in the ledger, it is typically challenging to alter or delete. Immutability ensures the integrity of the historical records, providing transparency and trust. Opportunities for DTL/ Blockchain Technology in Agriculture Sector: A DTL/Blockchain technology has several applications in agriculture that aim to enhance transparency, efficiency, and trust within the supply chain. Here are some ways DLT is used in agriculture: Supply Chain Traceability: DLT allows for the creation of an immutable and transparent record of the journey of agricultural products from farm to table. Each stage of production, including planting, TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 40 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 41 harvesting, processing, and transportation, can be recorded on the blockchain. This enhances traceability and helps consumers verify the authenticity and origin of the products. Smart Contracts for Agreements: Smart contracts on blockchain platforms enable the automation and execution of agreements between different stakeholders in the agriculture supply chain. For instance, contracts between farmers and buyers, specifying terms for the sale of crops, can be automatically executed based on predefined conditions. Digital Representation of Assets: Blockchain enables the tokenization of agricultural assets, representing ownership of physical assets like land, machinery, or even specific crops. This can streamline transactions involving these assets and make them more accessible for investment. Preventing Counterfeiting: Blockchain can be used to combat food adulteration by preventing the counterfeiting of products. By recording each step of the supply chain on an immutable ledger, consumers can trust the authenticity of the food they purchase.
