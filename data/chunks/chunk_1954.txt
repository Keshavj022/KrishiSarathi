 Dissolved Oxygen Sensor Measure the concentration of oxygen dissolved in water to maintain suitable Deployed in aquaculture ponds or tanks, these sensors transmit dissolved TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 43 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 44 conditions (Mainly used in Aquaculture) oxygen levels, allowing aquafarmers to adjust aeration, feeding rates, and stocking densities pH Sensor Monitor the acidity or alkalinity of soil or water to regulate nutrient availability, microbial activity, and overall crop health. Positioned in soil or irrigation systems, pH sensors provide continuous pH measurements, empowering farmers to adjust soil amendments or water treatment strategies, select appropriate crops, and prevent nutrient imbalances Image Sensor(Camera) Takes pictures of any object Disease detection, chlorophyll status, Fruit ripeness, Leaf area index (LAI), Harvest readiness, Soil erosion and other analysis Global Positioning System(GPS) Measuring the latitude and longitude of device, location. Local information is attached to generate alerts. Mostly used for machine driving &control, and tracking, land management and Crop mapping. Inertial Sensor Uses accelerometer and gyro sensor to determine the object altitude in relation to the inertial system Precise distance of plant, leaf or any other object is measured from camera Barometer Measure air pressure as an altimeter. Mostly used in correcting altitude measurements by the GPS Measures the elevation height in hilly agriculture Gyroscope Senses the angular velocity to track the object rotation or twist Equipment movement, Canopy structure measurement Accelerometer Measures acceleration forces that used to observe the tilting motion and orientation of the object Precise movement or rotation of the camera during use. Detect workers or machine activities Microphone Detect usual / unusual sound and convert to electrical signals Machine maintenance , Bug detection to make audio queries Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report conditions (Mainly used in Aquaculture) oxygen_ levels, allowing aquafarmers to adjust aeration, feeding rates, and stocking densities pH Sensor Monitor the acidity or alkalinity of soil or water to regulate nutrient availability, microbial activity, and overall crop health.
