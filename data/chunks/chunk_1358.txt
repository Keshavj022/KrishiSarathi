 In orchard-based systems, intercropping can significantly enhance the productivity and profitability of smallholder farmers. Intercropping involves growing compatible crops between the rows of main orchard trees, allowing for better utilization of available space, water, nutrients, and sunlight. This practice not only diversifies farmers’ income sources but also helps in risk mitigation. If one crop fails due to unfavourable conditions, others may still thrive, reducing overall economic risk. Demonstrations of pulses and oilseeds as intercrops in mango and guava orchards were conducted on farms, resulting in increased income and more efficient land utilization. Nutritional kitchen gardening is an effective intervention to address both food security and malnutrition among farming households, especially in marginal and small-scale farming communities. Kitchen gardens ensure a regular supply of fresh, organic, and diverse vegetables and fruits throughout the year, improving the nutritional intake of farming families by providing essential vitamins and minerals that may not be available from main crops alone. Technological assemblage through livestock based intervention The primary aim of ensuring year-round fodder production is to provide livestock with a consistent and nutritious feed supply, even during lean seasons when natural grazing or traditional fodder sources are scarce. The BNH Co-5 variety of Napier for year-round fodder production and Gobi Sarso during the rabi season were introduced. This intervention is particularly crucial for smallholder farmers who rely heavily on livestock for income through milk and manure. The use of mineral mixtures is essential for addressing nutrient deficiencies common in livestock diets in this region, especially due to the feeding of sugarcane tops as green fodder, which lacks essential minerals. These mixtures contain macro- and micro-nutrients like calcium, phosphorus, zinc, magnesium, and copper, which are vital for various bodily functions and overall livestock health, as well as improved reproductive performance. Calcium, in particular, is critical for dairy cattle, especially for lactating animals that require high amounts of calcium for milk production. Providing calcium supplements, typically in liquid form via calcium bottles, helps prevent calcium deficiencies, particularly during the post-calving period. Fenbendazole is an anthelmintic (deworming) medication used to treat and control parasitic infections in livestock, including gastrointestinal worms, lungworms, and tapeworms. Parasitic infestations are common in livestock and can severely impact their growth, productivity, and overall health. Table 2 presents data on the adoption of improved practices (IP) versus traditional farmers’ practices (FP) in dairy farming (cow and buffalo) and poultry farming. Around 55 farmers adopted improved practices for cow farming, realizing an enhanced milk yield of 7.8 lt/cow per day compared to 6.
