This is inconsistent with previous findings in which the greater fractions of GRSP were found in the zero tillage [15]. 12.2. Water stable aggregates, soil microbial biomass carbon and β-galactosidase activity (β-GaA) as influenced by tillage and weed management in conservation agriculture It is evident that other relevant soil quality related parameters (SQRPs) i.e., soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), β-galactosidase activity (β-GaA) and water stable aggregate size of 1–2 mm (WSA1–2mm) examined in the present study were also found to be significantly greater under conservation tillage plots. While weed management in conservation agriculture is of utmost importance, it is recommended to manage the weeds eco-friendly as to minimise the negative impact of applying herbicides to the soil environment on critical and sensitive soil biological properties. The SMBC and β-GaA were significantly enhanced by single hand-weeded control followed by integrated weed management (IWM) relative to herbicides treated plots (chemical weed control and herbicide rotation) (Table 3). This might be ascribed to conducive biophysical environment created for preponderance of rhizosphere soil microorganisms. Similarly, Manaswini et al. [48] and Nthebere et al. [49] announced the same results in which manual weeding at once and manual weeding in combination with the application of post-emergence herbicides (integrated weed management) in corn field resulted in an increased microbial activity.
