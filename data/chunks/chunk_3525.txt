 Manual weeding should be done as per need and earthing up in the rows should be done after weeding, especially during the rainy season. Harvesting Fruits are continuously harvested 5 to 6 days after the opening of flowers when they are tender. The growth and bearing of the plant are adversely affected if the fruits are not harvested timely. Average yield 120 q/ha during spring-summer season. 150 q/ha during kharif season. Plant protection Insect-pests Jassid or leaf hopper: The insects are greenish-yellow in colour and the adults and nymphs suck the sap from the lower surface of leaves, causing curling of leaves and burning effects on the edges. The insects lay small whitish round eggs on the lower surface of leaves. Control: Alternate spraying of systemic insecticide, viz. acetamiprid@ 0.3-0.5 ml/litre solution and spiromesifen@0.5 ml/litre of water at 10 days intervals. Table 1.

Control: Spray neem seed kernel extract (5%) or spraying of malathion @ 2 ml/litre or spinosad @1 ml/3 litres of water at 10-day intervals. Pheromone trap @20 traps/ha should be installed to trap the male insects. Whitefly The adults and nymphs suck the sap from the lower surface of leaves and damage the crop by transmitting Bhendi yellow vein mosaic virus disease. Control: Sowing of 3 rows of maize/bajara on all borders of the field around 45 days in advance. Yellow sticky traps should be installed in the field @20 traps /ha. Alternate spraying of systemic insecticides, like acetamiprid@0.03-0.05 % solution followed by spiromesifen@0.5ml/litre of water at 10 days intervals. Red spider mites The insects are very tiny and light reddish-yellow in colour and make net on the lower surface of the leaves.
