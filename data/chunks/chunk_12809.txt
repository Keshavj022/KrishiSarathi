There are 733 lakh farm families of whom 90 per cent of the cultivators being small and marginal farmers (less than 1 ha land holding). Large holdings (above 10 ha) are almost absent. Small and marginal farming communities hold 84% of the State’s agricultural lands as against 69.8 percent at all India level. Incidentally, this is the second highest in the country after Kerala. Thus, agriculture in the State is small farmer centric. The average size of land holding is only 0.77 ha. The per capita cultivable land holding is highly fragmented. This has resulted in uneconomic holding size to sustain a farmer’s family.   Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal.
