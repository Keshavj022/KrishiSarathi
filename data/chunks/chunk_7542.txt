 Similarly, for identification of germplasm lines with high NUE, 300 rice germplasm lines were phenotyped under nitrogen sufficient and deficient conditions. NUE varied from 3.6 to 32 g grain/g N uptake by plant at normal recommended dose of nitrogen application, while it varied from 6.3 to 49.6 g grain/g N uptake by plant under nitrogen deficient conditions. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) led to the identification of QTLs associated with NUE in rice. Genetic improvement of rice for yield, NUE, WUE, abiotic and biotic stress tolerance: Four genes were selected for genome editing for improving yield of elite rice varieties. Teosinte Branched1 (TB1) gene, a negative regulator tillering, was edited to crease a loss of function mutant of TB1 gene with 13 bp deletion in rice cv. MTU1010. The transgene free tb1 mutant produced about 35 tillers as compared with 15 tillers in WT MTU1010 plants and yielded 66–70% higher grain yield per plant. Dense and Erect Panicle 1 (DEP1) codes for G protein  subunit, involved in the regulation of number of grains per panicle. By using CRISPR-Cas9, a single base pair insertion mutant of dep1 was created in MTU1010. The dep1 mutant produced 52–54% and 21–15% higher grains/plant and grain yield per plant, respectively as compared with WT MTU1010. The OsCKX2 (Cytokinin oxidase/ dehydrogenase2) gene catalyzes the degradation of active cytokinin and thus, reduces the grain number. Hence, this gene function was knocked out by using CRISPR-Cas9 in rice cv. in MTU1010. The ckx2 mutant in MTU1010 produced about 53–64% increase in the grains per panicle as compared with WT plants. The miR156 binding site in the coding sequence of Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (SPL14/IPA1) gene was edited in Swarna. Putative mutants were developed by using CRISPR-Cas9 in Swarna with increase in grain number per panicle and about 20% high grain weight per plants were obtained. For enhancing abiotic stress tolerance, Drought and Salt Tolerance (DST) gene was edited by using CRISPR-Cas9 in MTU1010 led to the generation of different 19 mutants for the two guide RNAs of DST gene. A homozygous deletion mutant (deletion of 549–914 nucleotides) with loss of function was identified. Physiological analysis showed that this mutation conferred enhanced leaf width, reduction in stomatal conductance and enhanced salt and osmotic stress tolerance at seedling stage. For introducing tungro virus resistance, eIF4G gene was edited in rice cv. ASD16. Epigenetic regulation of host-pathogen genetics in leaf rust resistance of wheat: A total of 50 miRNAs and 1178 lncRNAs were identified through in silico analysis of RNA-seq data; of these, 16 miRNAs and 22 lncRNAs were differentially expressed (DE). Expression of 8 miRNAs was induced in resistant NIL which targeted several important genes including disease responsive genes. As many as 49 lncRNAs were found to be the targets for miRNAs; the results were also validated using qRT-PCR analyses.
