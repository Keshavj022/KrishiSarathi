 Fuzzy set theory The concept of fuzzy set theory is introduced by Zadeh (1965) with the objective of capturing the qualitative judgment of experts when dealing with a decision-making problem [56]. This theory gained popularity when conceptualizing real-life problem which is usually associated with uncertainty [57]. In the context of current research work, decision-making is complex since the subject of drones is fairly new in India, due to which the opinion of experts may differ. The framework of fuzzy set theory allows decision makers to share their opinions as a crips response when working with an unclear problem [58]. The generic representation of fuzzy set theory is shown below: Say ‘S’ refers to a set of elements and is represented as {s1, s2, s3, s4⋯⋯⋯sn}. Then, a fuzzy set ‘G’ for S can be represented as {s,μG(s) | s ∈S}. where, μG(s) is the membership function of fuzzy set S and the membership values range between 0 and 1. In this paper, triangular fuzzy membership functions, which are proven suitable for dealing with pragmatic situations, are used. Let ω1 = (α1, β1, γ1) and ω2 = (α2, β2, γ2) are the two triangular fuzzy numbers, and Eq. (1) represents the membership function [57]. μG(s) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ 0, s ≤α s −α β −α , s ∈[α, β] s −γ β −γ s ∈[β, γ] 0 s ≥γ ⎫ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎭ (1) 4.2. Fuzzy Delphi Delphi technique is a quantitative method used to collect the opinion of experts on a specific research question [59]. This technique is a reasonable approach to adopt when there is a lack of crisp guidelines on any aspect and explore the possible dimensions through discussion among a group of experts [60]. The concept of fuzzy set theory is inte­ grated with the Delphi technique by Ishikawa to account for the vagueness associated with opinions while discussing an unpopular problem [61]. Since the adoption of drones is an unpopular area, this study adopted Fuzzy Delphi. The procedure involved in assessing the barriers is presented below: Step-1 As a first step of analysis, the created list of barriers is floated among the experts. Step-2 Experts are then allowed to evaluate the relevance of each identified barrier in the Indian context using the scale presented in Fig. 6. The judgment on a bth barrier by eth expert can mathematically be expressed as Eq. (2). Eeb = (αbe, βbe, γbe) (2) where b ranges from 1,2,3,4 ….m, e ranges between 1,2,3,.. n, m is the total number of barriers. n is the total number of experts. The overall fuzzy weight corresponding to ‘bth’ barrier can be obtained using Eq. (3). E0 b = [ min(αbe), ( ∏ n e=1 βbe )1/n , max (γbe) ] (3) Step-3 The fuzzified score of each barrier obtained using Eq. (3) is further defuzzified using mean method which can mathemati­ cally be represented using Eq. (4).
