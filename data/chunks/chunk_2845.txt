General The ICAR is the public sector agricultural research body at the apex level for co-ordinating, directing, funding and promoting agricultural research, education and front-line extension in the country. It is mainly funded through lump-sum grants from the Government, and is accountable to the funds received from the Government. The ICAR has at present 6 multidisciplinary national institutes (deemed-to-be-universities), 42 central research institutes, 18 national research centres (NRCs), 6 bureaux, 24 project directorates, 60 All-India Co-ordinated Research Projects (AICRPs) and 565 KVKs. The ICAR, through its network of institutions and in partnership with SAUs and other stakeholders, aims to address challenging problems of food and nutritional security, poverty and sustainable resource management. As the institutions constitute the core of the ICAR, the effectiveness of each institution is crucial for the continued success of the ICAR system. Each institution is operating within the mandate assigned to it and the overall rules and guidelines of the ICAR; besides the other policy directives that may be received from time-to-time from the Government, and subsequently adopted by the ICAR.
