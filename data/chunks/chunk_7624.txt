 The RILs were identified with less water use and more yield under both well irrigated and drought stress conditions over both the parents. Potassium phosphite led to complete in vitro inhibition of fungal pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae, Rhizoctonia solani, and Fusarium fujikuroii. Chickpea genotypes ICC 13461, ICC 13523, ICC 8397, T39-1, ICC 5912 and ICC 9553 showed higher (>27%) seed protein contents, and 1.10–5.91 mg/100 g zinc and 0.50– 8.54 mg/100 g iron. The microbial consortia and accelerated techniques for production of compost were developed, which achieved maturity parameters much earlier in kitchen and farm waste compost under closed static system than un-inoculated control. The gravel bio filters performed most efficiently for total metal removal as compared to Graphite and FRP bio filters. The goats with AB genotype showed highest protein content (3.56%). Supplementation of nano-Se in broiler chicken improved cell mediated immunity. Strengthening the research system: The Agricultural Scientists Recruitment Board (ASRB) is under the administrative control of Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer’s Welfare, Government of India. During the period, Board advertised 72 Research Management Positions and recruitment action for all the positions is under process. During the year, a combined examination for Agricultural Research Service-2017 (Prelims) and NET 2018 (I) was conducted. Out of 181 recommended candidates, about 79.56% successful candidates were from 10 states (Rajasthan, West Bengal, Karnataka, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Haryana, Odisha and Telangana). Among 4,135 qualified candidates of NET-2018, 51% were female candidates and 49% were male candidates. Qualified candidates were mostly from rural area. Training and capacity building: During the year 2018–19, trainings were provided to almost all the category of employees of ICAR and Scientists (1,098), Technical officials (816), Administrative (733) including Finance officials, and SSS (630) were trained. Overall, 3,277 employees were trained which is about 18.2% of the total number of employees in ICAR. Impact Assessment of training programmes attended during 2017–18 by various categories of employees revealed that the overall Impact of training was Considerable - Great Extent. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research is a time tested premier organization. The Council has always been ahead of its times, it is visualizing the coming agricultural scenario and accordingly ready with appropriate technology for farmers. Developing suitable manpower, reaching to farmers and coordinating with various stakeholders to meet the challenges to Indian Agriculture is key to the success of ICAR.
