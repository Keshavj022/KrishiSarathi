49kW, respectively for turmeric crop. against conventional size of 325-450 mm Kolpa (Dora). Its field capacity is 8% more than conventional bhakar. It saves 7% (1 man-h/ha) labour and higher weeding efficiency by 12% in comparison to conventional one. For weeding in soybean, 3-row sweep cultivator has been modified to two rows to make suitable for guiding between rows. Draft, field capacity, weeding efficiency and labour requirement of two row sweep cultivator are 5.2 kg, 0.10 ha/h, 59% and 10 man-h/ha respectively. The use of this cultivator saves 40% time and labour requirement. Package of single bullock operated implements for farm operations This consists of blade harrow for tillage, two row planters for sowing and Twin Ferti hoe for weeding. The average draft requirement for blade harrow and planter is 348 N and 238 N, respectively. Field capacity of harrow, planter and Twin Ferti hoe is 0.06, 0.11 and 0.10 ha/h respectively. The average weeding Seed drill operated with single bullock Animal drawn improved bhakhar Maize dehusker sheller MECHANIZATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016â€“17 89 efficiency has been observed as 88%. The output power of blade harrow, planter and twin wheel has been worked out to be 0.11, 0.13 and 0.19 kW respectively. Cost of operation for harrowing with blade harrow and weeding with twin ferti hoe has been estimated as ` 835.0/ha and ` 910.0/ha, respectively. Light weight pneumatic wheel bullock cart With a payload capacity of 1.0 tonne, the cart is provided with brakes and shock absorbers for smooth travel on rural roads. The weight of the cart is 100 kg. Under plain tar road condition, the average draft increased from 83.3 N to 305.7 N and the average speeds decreased from 3.96 to 2.73 km/h when pay loads increased to 800 kg on tar road. It has been observed as the small size bullocks could sustain pulling 60d (50 kg tuber/ha mm) over no mulch condition (34 kg tuber/ha mm). Similar results were found when the mulch film was removed after 70 and 90 d. In terms of yield, the treatment of black mulch film removed after 60 d gave maximum yield (30.12 t/ha) followed by silver mulch removed after 60 d (29.3 t/ha) and no mulch (20.8 t/ha). Similar yield trends were also observed in case of mulch film removed after 70 and 90 d. In terms of economics, cost of cultivation was higher under the mulching condition (` 100,307/ha) in comparison to no mulching (` 89,578 /ha). However, the net returns were higher under black mulch (` 189,193/ha) followed by silver mulch (` 176,693 /ha) than without mulch (` 116,622/ha). The B:C ratio was also higher under black mulch (1.89) followed by silver mulch (1.76) than without mulch (1.30). ANIMAL ENERGY UTILIZATION AND MANAGEMENT Assessment of work efficiency in different categories of yak Work efficiency of yak was evaluated in different seasons to assess carrying capacity of yaks with different loads starting from 10 to 35% of their live bodyweight.
