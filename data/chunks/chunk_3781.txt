 Startup Support: Supporting startups is essential for driving change in the agricultural landscape. By connecting entrepreneurs with industry experts, investors, and government agencies, Universities can accelerate the growth of agri-tech ventures and create a thriving startup ecosystem. At the level of the Agri Universities, an enabling Startup Policy for students and faculty should be put in place. The pursuit of education, research and extension leading to entrepreneurship will be complete when a pipeline of potential entrepreneurs are created at the University itself, an incentive which a student-faculty led innovation can gain by testing their innovative hypothesis in the campus. The Assam Agricultural University (AAU) has embarked on an unique programme, wherein students right in the second year of UnderGrad are exposed to a customized entrepreneurship module. This spans from second year until they graduate by the fourth year. From this module, faculty members are attached to the students as mentors and together they bring up innovative solutions which are duly validated. On its part, the University has created a separate funding mechanism to support such startups and facilitate them to access more resources during their entrepreneurial journey. Cultivating Agripreneurs To foster entrepreneurship in Agricultural Universities, all the SAUs need to cultivate a culture that nurtures agripreneurs. This involves: y Entrepreneurship Education: Integrating entrepren- eurship courses into the curriculum equips students with the necessary business acumen and soft skills to navigate the challenges of starting and scaling a venture. Patenting and protecting intellectual properties and public goods generated at university and venture levels are to be highly encouraged. y Hands-on Experience: Providing students with hands- on experience through internships, hackathons, and startup competitions allows them to apply their theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios and build confidence as agripreneurs. y Mentorship and Guidance: Access to experienced mentors and industry experts is invaluable for young entrepreneurs. Encouraging faculty and industry leaders to act as mentors can significantly impact the success of aspiring agripreneurs. Innovating for Sustainable Agriculture/ Horticulture Innovation is the key to unlocking the potential of agriculture in the 21st century. The agricultural Universities must lead the charge by promoting research in areas such as: y Smart Farming: Leveraging technology, IoT devices, and data analytics to optimize agricultural practices, conserve resources, and enhance yields. y Sustainable Solutions: Developing eco-friendly alternatives to agrochemicals, promoting organic farming, and exploring climate-resilient crop varieties. y Supply Chain Optimization: Designing efficient and transparent supply chains that minimize wastage and ensure fair prices for farmers.
