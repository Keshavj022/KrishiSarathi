 Traditional methods such as visual inspection, spectroscopy, and HPLC are labour-intensive, time-consuming, and often lack robustness, highlighting the need for efficient high-throughput techniques. Hyperspectral imaging has proven effective in detecting chilling injury, a common postharvest disorder, with over 91% accuracy in apple, peach, and kiwi fruit. Biochemical component analysis: Horticultural crops contain valuable pigments such as anthocyanin, carotenoids, and chlorophyll, which are known for their antioxidant properties and health benefits. Traditional methods for quantifying these pigments involve labour- intensive lab extraction. While handheld devices offer nondestructive alternatives, they are not suitable for large-scale applications. Image-based phenotyping is gaining popularity as a non-destructive, rapid approach. Studies on red lettuce and cassava have demonstrated strong correlations between pigment content and image- derived indices. Additionally, optical sensors enable non- destructive monitoring of nutrient levels like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, supporting more precise crop management. Disease detection and quantification: Plant diseases are a major threat to global crop production, causing significant yield losses each year. Early and accurate detection is essential for effective phytopathology and breeding efforts. Traditional methods, which rely on visual scoring and lab analysis, are time-consuming and subjective. Recently, rapid, high-throughput disease detection using image analysis has become more popular. This method is particularly important for horticultural crops, which are vulnerable to various pathogens before and after harvest. Image analysis allows for the detection and quantification of diseases such as apple scab, fire blight, powdery mildew, and bacterial blights, enabling timely intervention to reduce yield and quality losses. Abiotic stress responses: Abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, heat, and cold negatively impact plant growth and yield. Rapid and accurate phenotyping of plant responses to these stresses is essential for breeding resilient genotypes. Image-based high-throughput phenotyping plays a crucial role in efficiently screening breeding programs aimed at developing climate-resilient crops. Various imaging techniques have been used to assess horticultural plantsâ€™ responses to different abiotic stresses. For example, hyperspectral imaging was employed to detect heat stress tolerance in ginseng, while cadmium stress in kale and basil was identified using high-throughput hyperspectral images, with the anthocyanin reflectance index proving effective across different stress levels. Current status and Future perspectives Publications on high-throughput phenotyping with image analysis are increasing, especially in agriculture and biological sciences, with 'fruit' being a dominant keyword, reflecting a surge in interest over the past five years.
