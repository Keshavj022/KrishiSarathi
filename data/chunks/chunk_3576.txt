 Utilizing resistant varieties such as Japani Longi, GKC-29, Kashi Gaurav, VR-339, and Jwala in chili, RHR58, Muthatakeshi, and Banta in brinjal, EC-329390 and IC-14-1065 in okra, and Sanjam and Lycopersicon peruvianum in tomato has proven effective. The application of Neem oil (3%) and NSKE (5%) in the field has shown efficacy against spider mites. Furthermore, the use of natural enemies, including predatory mites like Neoseiulus longispinosus and Phytoseiulus persimilis, coccinellids such as Menochilus sp., Coccinella sp., Adalia sp., and Scymnus sp., anthocorid bugs, and entomopathogenic fungi like Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae, Hirsutella sp., and Paecilomyces lilacinus, has been proven effective in controlling phytophagous mites. CONCLUSION The process of the evolution of phytophagous mites from minor to major pests is intricate and influenced by various factors. Factors such as agricultural practices, international trade, climate change, genetic mutations, and resistance to pesticides have played significant roles in the proliferation of mite populations as major pests across different regions. These factors have facilitated the dispersion and adaptation of mites, while additional factors including host plant diversity, natural enemies, and habitat fragmentation may contribute to the regulation of mite populations. Given the substantial economic and ecological implications of phytophagous mites, it is crucial to develop integrated pest management strategies that consider the multiple factors driving mite evolution. Such strategies may involve reducing reliance on pesticides, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, enhancing biosecurity measures, and improving the effectiveness of biological control agents. By adopting a comprehensive and proactive approach, it becomes possible to alleviate the impact of mites on agriculture and horticulture, fostering a more sustainable and resilient food system.
