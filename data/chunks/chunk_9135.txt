 In particular it would be for: @ improving the quality of oil to double zero or the canola type (low erucic acid and low glucosinolate) @ developing varieties in sunflower resistant to downy mildew and Alternaria blight, and hybrids with more per-hectare oil and yield @ developing non-shattering viable seed varieties in soybean @ improving upon the confectionery grade HPS groundnut varieties for export. We are predominantly a vegetarian population, meeting the intake of dietary proteins through pulses. The low-yielding pulse crops are grown rainfed. Research on the pulse crops began rather late, in 1966, when an Alllndia Coordinated Research Project on Pulses was set up. It has been upgraded to a Project Directorate in 1978. The Directorate has acquired a status equal to that of an institute in the Eighth Plan with three AlHndia Coordinated Research Projects — on chickpea, pigeonpea and MULLARP — also in operation. The production in pulses has been static for the last 40 years. To repeat the success achieved in oilseeds, the pulse crops have been incorporated into the “Technology Mission” in 1990. Anumber of improved varieties suited to different agroclimates have been released in the past decade. TECHNOLOGY MISSION 1990 BOOSTS PULSE PRODUCTION Five major pulse crops — chickpea, pigeonpea, moongbean, urdbean and lentil — have been included in the Technology Mission that has directed the success of oilseed crops. The activities related to pulses are: Enhancement of genetic resources and genetic improvement of pulse crops Development of proper production and protection technologies Development of suitable farm machinery and other agricultural equipment Production of appropriate quantities of breeders’ seed Transfer-of-Technology to farmers.

To ensure the gains of “Technology Mission”, research in pulse crops will intensify on: @ hybrid breeding in pigeonpea @ development of high-yielding varieties resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses @ early maturity for extending crop productivity @ development and wide adoption of integrated pest management against major pests and diseases. Nearly 5 million people are engaged in the cultivation and processing of the tobacco in the country. The crop grown in 0.45 million hectare yields 0.50 million tonne; average national productivity being 1.39 tonnes/ha. The tobacco contributes the highest excise revenue among agricultural commodities in India besides earning a forex equivalent of Rs 5,000 million. All major tobacco types grown in the world are being cultivated in India.
