  The injected broods are released in breeding pool. Spawning occurs after 6-8 h of injection. In general, 1.0-1.5 lakh eggs/kg female are obtained and fertilization levels remain over 90%.  Eggs are shifted to a hatching tank, where they are kept in floating condition with appropriate water circulation. Hatching occurs within 18-22 h at 27-28°C with 80-95% success.  The hatchlings are kept in the same hatching tank for another two days without feeding, as their yolk-sac remains up to 72 h. These free-swimming hatchlings, commonly known as spawn, grow to a size of about 5-6 mm when they are shifted to the nursery.  The spawn are reared in earthen nursery ponds and concrete tanks at stocking densities of 3-5 million/ha and 8-10 million/ha for 15-20 days during which they grow to an average fry size of 25 mm with survival rates of 30-35% and 50-60%, respectively. 2 Rohu Labeo rohita (Hamilton, 1822)  Rohu is the most important Indian major carp of the Indian Sub-continent.  Attains maturity in the second year of its life and breeds only in riverine conditions during monsoon. For captive breeding, brooders of 2+ year-class are raised in earthen ponds at biomass of 1,500-2,000 kg/ha.  Sexes are distinct during spawning season with females having bulged abdomen and soft pectoral fins. Male has slender body, rough pectoral fins and oozes milky-white milt from vent on pressing the belly.  Captive spawning is undertaken either in hapa or hatchery. In hapa breeding, a sex ratio of 1:2 female to male is maintained. However, in circular hatchery the ratio of female to male is maintained at 1:1.  Brooders are injected with either pituitary extract or commercial hormones. With use of pituitary extract, two doses of injection are given to females and one to males. However, a single dose of 0.4-0.5 ml/kg to female and 0.2-0.3 ml/kg to male, is given when commercial hormone is used.  Spawning occurs after 6-8 h. One kg female lay about 2.0 lakh eggs, which are round, transparent and semi-buoyant. Rate of fertilization is 80-95%.  Eggs are kept for hatching either in hatching hapa or spawning tanks of hatchery, which takes about 8-22 h for hatching at 27-28°C.  The hatchlings are kept in the hatching tank for another two days. The 3-days old spawn of 5-6 mm in size becomes ready for further rearing in nursery.  The spawn is reared in earthen nursery ponds at stocking densities of 5-10 million/ha in concrete nurseries even at higher density of 10-20 million/ha.  The technology of breeding and seed production is widely practiced in all Indian states.
