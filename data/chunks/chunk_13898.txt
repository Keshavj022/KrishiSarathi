[Vol. 69, mizing irrigation practices, and ensuring sustainable wa- ter use are essential components of successful carbon farming to overcome the challenge of limited water avail- ability in dryland areas. Additionally, accurate measure- ment and verification of carbon sequestration are critical for participation in carbon markets. Developing cost-ef- fective and reliable methods for monitoring soil carbon in these regions is necessary to ensure that farmers can ben- efit from carbon credits (Smith et al., 2020). Dryland soils are highly vulnerable to increased soil erosion, which could lead to the loss of productive surface soil. There is a huge potential for crop residue recycling in dryland ar- eas of India, which improves soil structure, soil organic matter as well as soil microbiome, which altogether will lead to climate change adaptation (Pawar et al., 2019). Applying biochar has a lot of potential to improve soil carbon sequestration, lessen residue burning, and improve soil health (Srinivasarao et al., 2013). It would facilitate transfer of carbon content from active to inactive carbon pool leading to climate change adaptation (Srinivasarao et al., 2019). By enhancing soil health, increasing carbon sequestration, and providing economic benefits through carbon markets, carbon farming practices can transform dryland agriculture. Addressing the major challenges such as water scarcity and economic viability is essential to realize the full potential of carbon farming in dryland re- gions of India. Millions of impoverished rural people who are closely connected to these areas will benefit from these initiatives. In the years to come, these will also be funda- mental for determining food security for burgeoning popu- lations as well as in lowering poverty (Srinivasarao et al., 2016). Dryland farming and carbon footprint nexus Dryland environments are characterized by a set of fea- tures that affect their capacity to sequester carbon (C). The main characteristic of drylands is lack of water. This con- strains plant productivity severely and therefore affects the accumulation of C in soils. The problem is aggravated because rainfall is not only low but also generally erratic.
