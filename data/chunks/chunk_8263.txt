63 ha for white Thailand and Mulluvadi, respectively. The total estimated area under cassava in Salem district in 2014 was 8324.2 ha. Medicinal and aromatic plants Twenty-eight genotypes of Andrographis peniculata were evaluated for their responses to foliar hormone application of 200 ppm GA3 (as a growth promoter) 30 and 45 days after transplanting, followed by 100 ppm ethrel (as a stress elicitor) 60 and 75 DAT. Hormonal application had increased the leaf area per plant (692 cm2) from 630 cm2 in the control. Planting of Coleus forskohlii during September and harvesting at 180 DAP produced maximum dry tuberous root yield of 16.34q/ha with total forskolin yield of 22.37 kg/ha and benefit : cost ratio of 2.63. Spices Application of FYM + NPK + PGPR + micronutrients resulted in highest yield (3.19 kg/standard), followed by application of FYM + NPK + micronutrients (2.91 kg/standard) in black pepper. Nursery raised in pro trays followed by transplanting exhibited maximum mean seed yield of fennel, dill, celery and ajwain (1966 kg/ha), followed by soil-less media (1890 kg/ha), nursery raised in soil (1712 kg/ha) and minimum in direct seed sown crop (1502 kg/ha). Application of botanical adjuvants (Sapindus mucorasai) seed extract (2%) and Dalbergia sissoo leaf gel (2%) with insecticide actamiprid (0.0025%) and botanical neem oil (2%) enhanced the efficacy by 61% and 45%, respectively for the control of aphids in coriander and cumin compared with sole application. CROP HEALTH MANAGEMENT Plant protection sciences and biosecurity awareness in India has advanced appreciably over the years. During crop season of 2016-17, the impending crop losses owing to whitefly in cotton and armyworm in rice were significantly reduced through timely interventions. Efforts have been intensified to manage invasive insect- pest Tuta absoluta, introduced into India, through IPM and fast-track regulations of effective insecticide molecules as nascent control measures. Proactive actions have been taken to meet challenges of alien pests and diseases such as wheat blast, Ug99 etc. prevalent in other parts of the globe. There is a need to strengthen global networking for ensuring availability of diagnostic tools/ kits/ techniques to monitor or quarantine, especially for the pests of economic importance in other countries, which are not reported from India. Similarly strict enforcement of domestic quarantine measures are necessary to restrict spread of the regional pests and pathogens within confined areas. Plant quarantine A total of 111,685 imported samples including transgenic (1070) and trial materials were processed for quarantine clearance. Of 1,676 samples infested/ infected with different pests, 1,467 samples were salvaged. Eighty- nine Phytosanitary Certificates were issued for export of 12,615 samples.
