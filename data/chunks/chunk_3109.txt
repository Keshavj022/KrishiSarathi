 Considering 25% dry matter yield decrement was encountered, approximately around 15, 16, 14 and 13 mg kg‐1 DTPA‐ extractable cadmium level was found critical for fenugreek, spinach, marigold and ladyfinger, respectively. A decrease of 25% in dry matter yield was recorded approximately around 20.41, 63.62, 72.09 and 24.82 mg kg‐1 Cd content in plant tissue for fenugreek, spinach, marigold and lady finger, respectively ( Table 8.1, 8.2). Response of French bean to multi level heavy metal contamination is shown in Fig 8.2. Fig 8.2 Effect of heavy metal Pb, Pb+Cd, Pb+CD+Ni, Pb+Cd+NI+Zn on French bean growth in alfisol.

Technology generated: • Visual symptoms of micronutrients in cereals, oilseeds and pulses and vegetable crops have been characterized . • Critical limits of zinc, sulphur boron, manganese and copper have been established for efficient diagnosis of nutritional disorders in plants. • Delineated micronutrient deficient areas in different districts, states and agro‐ecological zones of India and published soil fertility maps. • More than 50 Maps of zinc, iron, manganese was published for the use of various agencies. • Nutrient indexing revealed that deficiency of zinc is declining in soils of Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, Part of Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu while the deficiencies of boron, iron, manganese, multi‐ nutrients are emerging in some soils and crops. • Technology for optimizing the use of zinc , boron, iron, manganese, sulphur deficiencies have been developed for rice‐ wheat, maize‐ mustard/wheat cotton‐ wheat, maize‐raya, sesame‐ chick pea, soybean‐wheat, bajri‐mustard, sorghum‐wheat, rice‐rice, oilseed based cropping systems for different soils. • Micronutrient Seed treatment technology has been developed for enhancing fertilizer‐ use‐ efficiency (FUE) and reducing input cost and rate of fertilizer zinc application in important crops like maize, soybean, groundnut, wheat, rice, moong grown in marginally deficient soils. • Foliar feeding for iron and manganese for important crops has proved efficient and economical than their soil application.
