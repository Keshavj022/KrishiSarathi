 The study area map showing the location of experimental plots and wheat fields is shown in Figure 2. The experiment was carried out during the winter season of 2021–2022, with the crop being sown on 13 December 2021, and harvested on 15 April 2022. LCC was estimated using the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) method, and LAI was measured using a LAI-2000 plant canopy analyser (Li- Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). Three measurements were taken from each plot, and their average was used for the analysis. Finally, CCC was obtained by multiplying LCC with LAI (LAI × LCC).

Block diagram of the methodology used for the study. This study targeted an experimental wheat field of the HD 3059 variety located at the research farm of Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Indian Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR-IARI) (28°38'28.314"N latitude and 77°9’3.106”E longitude) 228 m above mean sea level. The wheat field consisted of three replications of fifteen plots (7.2 x 13 m size each), maintained at five graded nitrogen levels (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha-1), and three irrigation treatments (soil moisture sensor-based treatment (1); crop water stress index (CWSl)-based treatment (12); and conventional treatment (13)). The study area map showing the location of experimental plots and wheat fields is shown in Figure 2. The experiment was carried out during the winter season of 2021-2022, with the crop being sown on 13 December 2021, and harvested on 15 April 2022.
