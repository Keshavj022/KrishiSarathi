 Similarly, several exotic and high value vegetables (chive, leek, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, Chinese cabbage, celery, lettuce, globe artichoke, sweet corn, baby corn, asparagus etc.) are well adapted in our edaphic and climatic conditions; and need to be harnessed for domestic and export purposes. Technologies through systematic research and their adoption by farmers in addition to developmental policies of the government resulted in a tremendous increase in area (11.35 million ha), production (204.83 million tonnes) and productivity (18.0 t/ha). India accounts for 14% of the global acreage and 12% of the production, though vegetables occupied less than 3% of Indian Farming 75 (01): 48-52; January 2025 the total cropped area in the country. Vegetable market size has reached 7 lakh crores and is contributing 2.5% to national GDP. State-wise vegetable area as percentage of gross cropped area is highest in West Bengal (14%), followed by Uttar Pradesh (12%) and Madhya Pradesh (9%). The projected demand by 2030 will be 228.60 million tonnes for the increasing population which is 1.5% annually. The total organic produce exported Indian Farming 49 January 2025 during 2020-21 was 8.88 lakh MT worth `7,07,849.52 lakhs. Strategies for sustainable vegetable production Promoting export During 2021-22, India exported fresh vegetables worth `5745.54 crores / 767.01 USD Millions; processed vegetables (`3986.45 crores/ 534.98 USD Millions), and processed cucumber and gherkins (`1487.30 crores/ 199.46 USD Millions). Application of smart farming in vegetables IoT devices like e-Crop helps to do precision farming. Inclusion of auto fertigation, drone based input application and determination of insect pest, diseases, crop canopy, etc. adds to precise and timely interventions which are essential for healthy crop. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has capability to make accurate forecasting on demand, supply and prices. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Internet of Things (IoT) are helpful in efficient sorting and grading of the products. Inclusion of high yielding varieties/hybrids Through AICRP (Vegetable Crops), a total of 553 vegetable varieties (329 open pollinated, 168 hybrids and 56 open pollinated/hybrids/resistant to different biotic and abiotic stresses) till date are recommended for cultivation in various agro-climatic zones of the country and being adopted by the growers, widely.
