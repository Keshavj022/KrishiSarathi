 Phased application of proper pesticides ensuring correct dosage and coverage depending upon the pest and age of the crop • Adoption of recommended agronomic practices ; Avoiding closer spacing, high dose of nitrogenous fertilizers and excess irrigation • Inter cropping with cowpea/sorghum/soybean to enhance the natural enemy population of cotton pests and to diversify the cropping system • Trap cropping of castor for Spodoptera and okra/pigeon pea for Helicoverpa • Hand collection and destruction of grown up larvae and damaged plant parts etc • Cotton leaf curl virus disease has been introduced from the neighbouring cotton growing country into western part of Punjab and Rajasthan few years ago • IPM strategy consisted of Sex pheromone, release of Trichogramma and spraying of neem based insecticides and need based synthetic insecticides. This proved to be effective in managing cotton pest complex • Basal application of neem cake at 150 kg/ha coupled with drenching 1% neem oil helped in minimising stem weevil damage • Major emphasis is given for developing varieties/hybrids resistant to key pests • Role of egg larval parasite‐ Chelonus blackburni‐ in control of bollworms was established • Growing of intercrops like cluster bean and Maize reduced pest infestation in Andhra Pradesh • Cotton intercropped with cowpea blackgram and greengram had lesser incidence of jassids and bollworms • Flavobacterium sp. was found effective in control of bacterial blight Following genotypes have been identified for their pest and disease tolerance and have been appropriately deployed in the resistance breeding programme for development of multi adversity resistance lines with better yielding ability for different regions Biotic Stress Variety Zone White fly Abadhita, LK 861, Kanchana, Supriya South zone Boll worm Abadhita South zone Cotton leaf curl virus disease LHH 144, CSHH 198,RS 810, RS 875, RS 2013, F 1861, H1117 North zone www.icar.org.in 7 2002 ‐ 2007 Fusarium wilt G Cot 13, Eknath, Rohini Central zone Bacterial Blight Arogya Central zone Verticillium wilt MCU 5 VT, Surabhi South zone Recommendations for the Management of Diseases Disease Recommended fungicide/bactericide/bioagents Root rot Seed treatment with carboxin 200 wp @3 g/kg seed Trichoderma viride talc formulation‐seed treatment @ 10g/kg seed plus soil amendment @ 2.5 kg/ha Bacterial blight Strepto cycline (100 ppm) + copper oxychloride (0.3%) as foliar spray at an interval of 10 days Alternaria leaf spot Dithane M 45 or copper oxychloride as foliar spray twice at an interval of 10 days Grey mildew Carbendazim/ Prochloraz/ Propiconazole 0.1% as foliar spray Myrothecium leaf spot Carbendazim/ Copper oxychloride as foliar spray Biological control Several antagonistic organisms were evaluated for the management of Root Rot and foliar diseases of cotton. Trichoderma harzianum has been found to control the root rot effectively in northern cotton growing states such as Rajasthan and Haryana.
