 Fruit is small and dark green with discontinuous ridges Dwarf coriander Nagori pan methi (Trigonella corniculata) Sweet basil (Ocimum basalicum) IC 646866 Nagori Ashwagandha Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia var. muricata) IC0642345 Tomato IC0637253 Petaliod-CMS line of red carrot INGR22160 for higher leafy yield (2.25 kg/6 m2 plot). Plant height goes up to 15-20 cm as compared to traditional Pusa Kasuri (20-30 cm) and leaf yield (1.53 kg/plot) in same plot size (6 m2). This genotype has also been validated at farmersâ€™ field at different locations in Rajasthan. Registration of germplasm for unique traits A total 15 germplasm have been registered at ICAR- NBPGR, New Delhi for different unique traits in fruits, vegetable, flowers and medicinal and aromatic plants. The unique traits and other details are given below: GENETIC RESOURCES ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 62 LIVESTOCK Gazette Notification of newly registered animal breeds Ten registered breeds of livestock were Gazette notified by the Ministry on February 13, 2023 [No. 3589 (S.O.680(E))]. These breeds included Kathani (Maharashtra), Sanchori (Rajasthan), Masilum (Meghalaya) cattle; Purnathadi buffalo (Maharashtra); Sojat (Rajasthan), Karauli (Rajasthan), Gujari (Rajasthan) goat; Banda (Jharkhand), Manipur Black (Manipur), Wak Chambil (Meghalaya) pig. After including these breeds, total 212 indigenous breeds (53 of cattle, 20 of buffalo, 37 of goat, 44 of sheep, 7 of horses and ponies, 9 of camel, 13 of pig, 3 of donkey, 3 of dog, 1 of yak, 19 of chicken, 2 of duck and 1 of geese) have been notified by the Government till date. New breeds CARIBROSAMRIDHI: The Central Avian Research Institute in Izatnagar has developed a coloured desi broiler chicken variety known as CARIBROSAMRIDHI for meat production. This variety produces high-quality meat under local rearing and feeding practices. The salient features of the developed variety are attractive-multi coloured plumage and feather breeds were characterized phenotypically as per the guidelines of ICAR-NBAGR. Whole genome of indigenous (Ghungroo and Mali) and exotic (Hampshire and Large White Yorkshire) was undertaken and the mean size of the genome was about 2.55 GB. Ex-situ conservation of AnGR During the period, 18,050 semen doses of 4 cattle breeds (Malnad Gidda, Hariana, Gir, Gangatiri); 3 buffalo breeds (Nili Ravi, Mehsana, Surti) and 2 goat breeds (Osmanabadi, Sangamneri) were cryopreserved. Also, 2,240 somatic cell vials of 19 native breeds, viz. Ladakhi, Siri and Sahiwal cattle; Changthangi, Bhakarwali, Gaddi and Teressa goat; Gurez, Bonpala, Karnah and Gaddi sheep; Agonda Goan, Wak Chambil, Niang Megha, Mali, Banda and Nicobari pig; Mewati camel and Kathiawadi horse were cryopreserved for long term conservation. At present, National Gene Bank has repository of 61 native breeds/populations of livestock and poultry in form of semen, 47 in form of somatic cells. Further, 122 oocytes (vitrified) of 5 native breeds were also cryopreserved.
