 Discussion The results indicate that at low aridity index, yield is more sensitive to climate change than to variability but when AI is high, the system becomes responsive to both climate change as well as variability. Grain yields in Central India are also found to be very sensitive to interannual precipitation variability (Kumar et al., 2011). Temperature increases, as well as uneven distributions of precipitation and corresponding changes in soil moisture changes lead to dry conditions during the growing season and have an impact on ET. Such conditions must drive cropping decisions so that the yield is not significantly reduced. Though the yield thresholds can be maintained in the LBIP system, there is still possibility of improving the yields. However, demand management measures may not work well in this case, as can be seen from the right-hand side of the response surfaces. Better option will be through reducing the tempera­ ture stresses by changing the sowing dates. Although, this study inves­ tigated only irrigated paddy cultivation, the impact of climate variability on rainfed paddy yield will be much greater. Though the analysis shows that there is no risk to rice production by an increase in precipitation and temperature in the future, this is under the assumption that the normal yield is to be maintained at 4 t/ha. To achieve the goal of sustainable food production as envisaged by SDG1, water and land productivity enhancement is needed. Analysis has shown that if the normal yield is to reach 4.25 t/ha, the risk will be high. For irrigated rabi rice production, the average yield in India is 3–6 t/ha. Aiming to that level of productivity will eventually introduce the system to high risk. Identifying the risks posed by climate-related stressors allows deci­ sion makers to better plan adaptation actions. The method used in this paper treats risks as failures of the system to meet pre-defined objectives by various stakeholders, when climate conditions change in the future. Fig. 15.
