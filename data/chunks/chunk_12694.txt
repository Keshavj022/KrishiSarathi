 Challenges   Frequent monsoon failures, vicissitudes of cyclones and occurrence of tsunami are the natural hazards that pose major threats to the growth of the fishery industry as a whole   More micro players in the sector pushing down the prices and ultimately collapse the market   Inadequate infrastructure for seed production discourages the farmers in taking up inland fish culture   High input cost especially for feed and non-availability of low cost feed   Improper waste disposal and environmental pollution by coastal / brackish water shrimp farming act as the threat for their own survival and growth   High siltation of tanks and water ways and lack of periodic desilting activities and   Import of fish from other countries 25.2 STRATEGY TO BE FOLLOWED FOR DOUBLING OF FARMERS INCOME Policy approach so far, has been diverted towards irrigated agriculture to increase agricultural 500 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 production. Now the concern is that the gains from the green revolution areas have been plateauing out due to several factors and evidences suggest that the productivity and returns to investment have substantial trickle down benefits for poor not only in irrigated areas but also those in less favored areas. Hence, it is inevitable that rain fed areas need to be promoted. The major strategies to achieve higher growth could be   Productivity Improvement by bridging the present yield gap   Diversifying the cultivation in favour of high value horticulture and commercial crops   Supply of Quality inputs in time through Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)   Bringing the fallow land under cultivation through cost-effective technology transfer   Promoting Integrated Farming System on whole district saturation approach   Promoting agri business venture duly with farmer’s participation   Inviting more Public Investment and through PPP mode in creating agri infrastructure to act as growth drivers rather mere hard ware’s and   Improving Knowledge Transfer to farmers through ICT enabled extension and market led agriculture The approaches to achieve these growth parameters should be location specific and need to be drawn on felt need basis. The formulation of bottom-up plans would speed up the process of growth as they primarily address the concern of location specific and need based Strategies to be followed in Agriculture In agricultural sector, considering the various challenges much emphasis has to be given for the enhancement of crop production, usage of balanced chemical nutrients, organic agriculture, integrated farming system, integrated nutrient management and strengthening of infrastructural facilities. In what follows the performance of the crops across the districts action plans to double the income of farmers are discussed are presented and discussed Enhancement in Crop Production Rice Over the years, area under rice had grown positively in 18 districts viz.
