 Low access of agricultural education to rural students, non-contemporary course curricula and delivery methods, inadequate state funding, unplanned proliferation of SAUs and colleges, regional imbalances in agricultural education facilities, lecture methods still dominating the teaching, lack of brand value for most of SAUs, disconnect between the requirements of industry and the education being imparted, the major challenge of ensuring the quality of education imparted through > 400 private colleges, gender inequality, mismatch of infrastructure for quality education, research & extension, extensive academic inbreeding in faculty recruitment, poor faculty strength, poor governance, lack of environment for nurturing and retaining talent, lack of faculty-competence in cutting edge technologies, low priority to agricultural education as career option & declining quality of students admitted, growing unemployment (43% graduates, 25% post graduates),shifting employment opportunities from public to private sector are some of the issues that need to be tackled to make the agricultural education more vibrant and attractive. Agricultural Education is required to evolve in tune with rapidly changing national and international scenario. Instead of being the world’s largest ICAR- AU system, the country needs to have the world’s finest ICAR-AU system. Vijayakumar (2017) reported the status of admission and placement scenario of Agriculture stream graduates over 22 Agricultural Universities in India (Table-23). Critical Gaps and Concerns in Higher Agricultural Education 5 “Education is the manifestation of the perfection already in man. Religion is the manifestation of the Divinity already in man.” –Swami Vivekananda Students going hands-on-training at CFTRI, Mysore 55 Landscape of Higher Agricultural Education in India 56 Table 23. Admission and placement scenario of Agriculture graduates in India Year Admissions Placement Percentage 2011 3982 956 24.0 2012 4272 1149 26.9 2013 4399 917 20.8 2014 5097 1037 20.3 2015 5669 1092 19.3 It may be observed from the Table that the admission status of agriculture graduates gradually increased from 3982 in 2011 to 5669 in 2015. However, All India placement status of agriculture graduates during 2011 to 2015 varied between 19.3 to 24.0 %. This shows a low placement of agricultural graduates after completion of their education. Success of an educational institute is rated not only based on the technologies developed by it but also on demand and marketability of its product, i.e. quality of students and their placement in market. The dynamic business environment necessitates the need to inculcate and instil employable skill-sets among the agriculture graduates. Rather than increasing the supply of graduates, universities need to focus more on improving the qualitative aspects like computer skills, presentation skills, personality development, practical and technical knowledge of the graduates, etc.
