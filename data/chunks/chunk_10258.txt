 Indian Agriculture after Independence 118 Year Milestone 2000 National Research Centre on Seed Spices was established at Ajmer. NRC on Arid Horticulture was elevated to full-fledged Institute as Central Institute for Arid Horticulture (CIAH), Bikaner, Rajasthan. Maru Samridhi new Lasoda and Maru Gaurav new Karonda, Goma Kirti in Ber varieties were developed. 2001 Establishment of National Research Centre on Litchi at Muzaffarpur, Bihar. Gandaki Sampada and Gandaki Lalima are promising varieties released. 2004 Arka Kalyan onion variety was released by IIHR, Bengaluru. 2005 Establishment of National Research Centre on Pomegranate, Solapur, Maharashtra. 2006 To recognise the scope for development of horticulture in NE region, Central Institute of Horticulture was established at Medziphema, Nagaland. 2013 India’s first triple disease resistant tomato F1 hybrid Arka Rakshak was released for commercial cultivation. 2015 1st Biofortified variety of cauliflower Pusa Beta Kesari was released by IARI-RRS Katrain which is rich in β-carotene. 2017 Promising biofortified variety of pomegranate ‘Solapur Lal’ was released rich in Zn, Fe, Vit C and anthocyanins was released by NRC on Pomegranate. Biofortified Sweet potato Bhu Krishna (rich in anthocyanins), Bhu Sona (rich in β-carotene) were released by CTCRI-RRS Bhubaneswar. The major landmarks of research in horticulture that supported the growth of the sector in this country include the following; Advanced propagation techniques have been developed in case of fruit crops (tissue culture with virus indexing in banana (Selvarajan et al. 2011); shoot tip grafting, micro-grafting and micro-budding in citrus (Karunakaran et al., 2014) and potato (aeroponics) (Bag et al. 2015), that are helping in large scale production of disease-free (freedom from virus(es), viroids, bacteria, nematodes) planting material. Canopy management practices have been standradized in different temperate, tropical and sub-tropical fruit crops. Rejuvenation technology for restoring production in old and senile orchards of mango, litchi, cashew, guava, ber and aonla has been standardized. High density planting technology of fruit crops has been standardized in mango (Ram et al. 1996), guava (Singh et al, 2005), banana (Biswas and Kumar 2010), citrus (Ladaniya et al. 2020), pineapple (Radha et al. 1990), pomegranate (Pal et al. 2014), papaya (Ranjan et al. 2018), cashew (Yadukumar et al. 2001) and coconut (Maheswarappa et al. 2013); employing dwarfing and semi-dwarfing rootstocks in mango (Reddy et al. 2003), citrus (Sonkar et al. 2002), guava (Sharma et al. 1992), litchi (Dhakar and Das 2017), apple (Rana and Bhatia 2003), canopy architecture modifications, understanding the rhizosphere dynamics and nutrient source–sink relations and use of bio-regulators, mechanization increased the farm productivity.
