 Boron deficiency is lesser than 10% in central (AESR 4.4, 10.1,10.2,10.3 and 10.4), western (AESR 2.1 and 2.2) and south eastern (AESR 7.3, 18.2 and 18.3) parts of India. The soils of AESR 1.2, 7.2, 9.2, 11,13.1,19.2 and 19.3 are exhibiting B deficiency in the range of 20-30%. These digitized maps of micronutrients status would be helpful in providing site-specific variable rate application of micronutrients prescription for sustainable agricultural productivity. Leucaena Biochar: Biochar, a product of slow pyrolysis of biomass, can enhance natural rates of carbon sequestration in soil, reduce farm waste, and improve soil quality. The amendment effect of Leucaena biochar was investigated in an incubation study in acid soil (pH 4.5) of northwest India. The mean increase in soil pH was 0.695, 1.35 and 2.0 unit at 2, 4 and 6% of biochar incorporation, respectively. Application of biochar significantly reduced ammonium content of soil, whereas nitrate N content increased by 3 and 5 times by application of 2 and 4% of biochar respectively. Exchangeable soil potassium and Ca+Mg concentrations increased with the application of biochar. Application of biochar above 2%, reduced exchangeable aluminum concentration to non-detectable limit. Thus, Leucaena biochar may serve as an amendment for N transformation in highly acidic soils. Cost-effective check dam with plastic sheet head wall: Check dams were constructed using two thickness of sheets (10 mm and 15 mm) and 3.0 m × 1.5 m size for 1.2 m high head wall with MS angle frame, while other components of check dam were of cement brick masonary. A saving of 30-47% on cost was indicated without any effect on life and performance of the check dam. These plastic structures successfully withstood the monsoonal runoff and overflows without any notable damage. Such constructions will be very useful for instalation of quick and low cost check dam structures in remote areas. Drainage solutions for waterlogged saline Vertisols: The subsurface drainage SSD system was installed in waterlogged saline soils (ECe 3.4-41.0 dSm) at 2 locations of Bharuch district of Gujarat. The SSD was installed with two different lateral spacings (35 m and 40 m) at 1.2 m depth. These sites have gravity outlet condition and natural drainage channel was present along the boundary of one site. Local communities are being sensitized for the active participation for successful operation of these projects. In situ decomposition technology for crop residues: The crop yield was better in in-situ decomposition treated plot than removal/burning of crop residues. Such experiments were conducted at farmers’ fields (20) in Haryana and Madhya Pradesh (20). Moreover, in-situ decomposition technique was tested at farmers’ fields (20) in Maharashtra for sugarcane trash, wherein it took 45 days for in-situ trash decomposition.
