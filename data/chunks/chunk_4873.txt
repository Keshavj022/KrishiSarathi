 With AI handling these aspects, growers can focus on more strategic tasks, reducing operational costs and making farming more scalable. In large-scale vertical gardens or greenhouses, this can significantly lower the labour costs. Early detection and prevention of stresses: AIâ€™s ability to process and analyze large amounts of data allows for early detection of stresses, such as diseases, pests, or nutrient deficiencies. This early detection is critical for preventing crop loss and ensuring that interventions are applied in a timely and efficient manner. For example, detecting powdery mildew early in a greenhouse can prevent the spread of the disease, protecting yields and reducing the need for chemical fungicides. Challenges and Future prospects While AI technologies offer enormous potential, some challenges remain. The initial investment in AI- based plant production systems can be high, particularly for small-scale farmers. Additionally, the use of AI requires specialized knowledge to interpret the data and manage the systems effectively. Data security and privacy concerns, especially in large-scale operations, where AI systems rely on cloud computing, are also emerging challenges. However, the future of AI application in vertical farming and protected cultivation looks promising. As the AI technology becomes more affordable and user- friendly, its adoption is likely to increase. In the coming years, advancements in AI-powered robotics, drones, and machine learning models will make these systems more autonomous and scalable. The integration of AI with other technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data analytics will further enhance precision in agriculture, allowing farmers to manage crops with unprecedented accuracy. SUMMARY AI-based modules are transforming vertical farming and protected cultivation technologies by making these systems more efficient, productive, and sustainable. Intention of using automated systems is to maximize the yield per unit area with least human interventions. Inputs should be delivered to plants with utmost care by using sensors. Sensors can be utilized for collecting real time data for monitoring the environmental parameters and substrate parameters for precise provision of lighting in grow light system. LED lightings have careful adjustments to different wavelengths, which is directly related to better growth and hence this is one of the most innovative inventions in the field of vertical farming. Automation helps to eliminate the levels of labour and risk of human faults for precise vertical farming. Artificial intelligence (AI) could be integrated in vertical farming for various activities like crop and substrate monitoring, pest and disease detection, spraying of nutrients and PP chemicals, harvesting, grading, sorting etc.
