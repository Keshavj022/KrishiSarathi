Synergising the agri-startups with FPOs for Atmanirbhar Bharat India canâ€™t become Atmanirbhar unless the income and livelihood of its food producers are ensured. Currently, the income from farming is abysmally low, merely Rs. 816 per capita per month. The farm income can be increased by either reducing cost of crop/ animal production, or by increasing per unit productivity by adopting modern production technologies and improved resources use efficiency or by creating and capturing value from the agricultural value chain. It may happen alone or in combination of these factors. For these to happen, innovators and producers need to come together. Therefore, strong synergy between agri-startups and FPOs (Farmer Produce Organisations) are imminent. It offers win-win opportunities for both the entities.
