 • High BPH-resistant and multiple resistant genotype CR2711-76 (Tapaswini × Dhobanumberi) submitted to the SVRC, Odisha as CR Dhan-317 after its promising performance in farmers’ field of BPH endemic areas of Odisha with average yield of 5.42 t/ha. High BPH- resistant breeding line CR3006-8-2 (Pusa 44 × Salkathi), also performed well in farmers’ field during 2018 and 2019, and the variety release proposal is in progress. • Ten stabilized promising rice genotypes were identified with seed protein content of more than 12% and zinc grain content of 20%. Two promising lines with high zinc and iron content, and five genotypes with high methionine, lysine, and amylose content were listed. Including higher grain yield, six genotypes were separated for further multiplication and bigger trials (Plant Nos.23-5- 237, 23-5-297, 23-5-224, 23-5-92, 23-5-94, and 23-5-279) and based on performance one genotype 23-5-297 was taken for field farm trial in identified farmer field for large scale testing. Animal Sciences • The mycoplasmological examination of 74 tissue samples collected from the commercial poultry affected with respiratory infections from different parts of Haryana revealed the isolation of 10 Mollicutes organisms (13.5%) including 4 M. gallisepticum (MG), 1 M. synoviae (MS) and 5 mixed infections of MG and MS confirmed by different biochemical and molecular tests. Higher prevalence of MG 9/74 (12.16%) was reported as compared to MS 6/74 (8.1%) among poultry flocks. • Anthelmintic efficacy of ethanolic fruit extract of E. ribes was assessed in in vivo trial in sheep. The results suggested promising efficacy of ethanolic fruit extract of E. ribes against most pathogenic GI nematode H. contortus and an effective formulation can be developed from fruit extract of E. ribes. • Polymerase spiral reaction (PSR) test and Loop- mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test were developed and standardized using in-house synthesized primers specific for MDV-1 oncogene (Meq) to visualize the amplified product under naked eye or UV light after addition of SYBR Green-I dye. • Latex agglutination test (LAT) was developed and standardized using rpp38 antigen to detect MDV-1 antibody in field chicken serum samples. • Recombinant antigen (rpp38) based immunocomb dot-ELISA was developed and evaluated for detection of MDV-1 antibody in chicken serum samples. Horticultural Sciences • Ready-to-eat and convenience foods such as Instant Halwa mix, Idli mix, Dhokla mix, Khichdi mix and Daliya mix were standardized and developed using different composite flours of coarse cereals, germinated chickpea and tulsi leaves.
