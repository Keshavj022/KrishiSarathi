46 Mt (2019-2020) mainly due to increase in per capita consumption, growing demand of increasing population and greater freedom of import to the open market through open general licensing (OGL). The demand for edible oil was 25.63 Mt in 2019-20 against domestic production of 10.53 Mt (7.03 Mt from primary sources and 3.50 Mt from secondary sources) necessitating the import of 15.10 Mt to fill the demand and supply gap. Achievements in Field Crops in Independent India 79 2.3. Sugar Revolution India has witnessed Sugar Revolution during the past 70 years. Sugarcane production increased from 57.05 Mt (1950-51) to 405.42 Mt (2019-20). The country has the best infrastructure for R&D in sugar crops. Integrative R&D efforts enabled the release of short duration, drought- and disease-tolerant sugarcane varieties and helped to its spread to central, northern, and western India. In independent India, 115 improved varieties have been developed which helped in the steady increase of sugarcane production with improved sugar recovery. The ‘wonder’ sugarcane variety Co 0238, which was notified in 2009 with a rare combination of high cane yield and sugar recovery, as these are negatively correlated has been benefiting both farmers and the sugar industry. The Co 0238 showed consistent performance across India. In a short period, it occupied >80% area during 2012-13 in Uttar Pradesh, the largest sugarcane growing State. From 2016 to 2021, the average cane productivity increased from 69.0 to 82.9 t ha-1. 2.4. Gene Revolution India has been the key player in reaping the harvest of the ‘Gene Revolution’ in the early 2000s. The partnership of Indian private company Mahyco with the multi-national private company Monsanto, formulized with the efforts from ICAR and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), led to the release of the first three genetically modified Bt cotton based on transgenic technology in India in 2002. Later, RCH-2 hybrid of Rasi Seeds was approved in 2004. The cotton area got a boost from 7.7 Mha area in 2002-03 to 13.4 Mha area by 2020-21 with >94% share of Bt cotton hybrids. The Bt cotton proved a game- changer for exports from India. India emerged as second major exporter of cotton. In 2019, increased cotton production enabled India starting cotton export which earned over three billion US dollars. 2.5. Pulse Revolution India has witnessed the ‘Pulse Revolution’ assuring near self-sufficiency in pulses in the late 2010s. The indigenous production of total pulses registered impressive growth during the last five years with the evidence that production jumped from 16.26 Mt (2015-16) to 25.72 Mt (2020-21) registering impressive growth in productivity from 786 kg ha-1 (2016-17) to 892 kg ha-1 (2020-21). At the time of independence, India was producing the pulses to the tune of 8 Mt only. The ever-highest production of pulses could be recorded during 2020-21 (25.72 Mt) which was almost twice the production of 13.30 Mt realized during 1993-94.
