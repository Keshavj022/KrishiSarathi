(2023) Indian Farming 51 June 2023 India initiatives for carbon emission mitigation from agriculture Despite having no binding mitigation obligation under UNFCCC in the pre-2020 period, India has achieved 21% reduction in emission intensity of GDP by 2014 with the voluntary declaration. Government of India has initiated several actions for carbon mitigation from agriculture. Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, launched the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) in 2010 to address the issues of agricultural sustainability and develop appropriate strategies for food and livelihood security and economic stability. National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA), launched by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in 2011 to enhance the resilience of Indian agriculture to climate change. Several major programmes of Government of India such as National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) emphasize on implementation of climate-smart technologies at farmer fields.
