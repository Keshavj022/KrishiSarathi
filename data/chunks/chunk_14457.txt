, 2015; Nam et al., 2015). For the L. Kaur et al. Agricultural Water Management 274 (2022) 107956 5 present investigation, 12-month SPI was considered for the identifica­ tion of drought events and further seasonal SPI from December to March (2001-02 to 2019-20) was correlated with the NVSWI derived from NDVI and LST. 2.4.1. Vegetation Health Index (VHI) NDVI provides a good indication of the chlorophyll content and vegetation cover, and LST provides a proxy to assess the evapotranspi­ ration from the canopy and soil moisture content (Karnieli et al., 2010). The NDVI-derived Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and LST derived Temperature Condition Index (TCI) has been extensively used to detect the start of a drought, as well as its intensity, duration, and impact. The VCI and TCI for the growing season of wheat (December-March) from 2001-02 to 2019-20 were computed using NDVI and LST data respec­ tively. The VCI and TCI, were computed using Eqs. (5) and (6) respec­ tively, reflect the relative greenness and temperature of the plants (Kogan, 1995, 1997). VCI = NDVIj −NDVIk min NDVIk max −NDVIk min × 100 (5) TCI = TCIk max −TCIj TCIk max −TCIk min × 100 (6) Where, j represents the month, and k represents the year. VCI and TCI, as NDVI and LST normalizations, emphasize relative variations in local NDVI and LST over time. VHI, which indicates the health of the vegetation, is an additional combination of the VCI and TCI with the same weight assuming an even contribution from two param­ eters (Eq. (7)). VHI = α × VCI + (1 −α) × TCI (7) Since VCI and TCI reflect distinct features of the vegetation response to drought and are independent of one another, a weighted summation, rather than a simple addition, provides the optimum fusion performance (Sun and Kafatos, 2007). Hence, α in Eq. (7) represents the weights that is a constant value (0.5) for this study. 2.4.2. Computation of Vegetation Supply Water Index (VSWI) and Normalized Vegetation Supply Water Index (NVSWI) Another most extensively used agricultural drought indicator is the VSWI (Carlson et al., 1990). VSWI reflects the linkages between changes in the temperature of the canopy and soil water supply (Chen et al., 2018; Sandeep et al., 2021). Vegetation having adequate soil water supply has a relatively lower LST, while LST will be high over the vegetated areas with inadequate soil water supply (Tan et al., 2004). During a drought event, content of available soil water is likely to be smaller due to the high temperature, resulting in an intensified evapo­ transpiration rate. VSWI was computed using Eq. (8) from 2001-02 to 2019-20 (December-March). VSWI = NDVI LST (8) The larger values of VSWI indicates elevated vegetation transpiration and higher soil water content, and vice versa. This NDVI/LST ratio is useful for determining the type of agricultural drought that endures in a given area due to variations in plant cover and soil moisture stress.
