Monetary advantage of improved varieties of mothbean over farmers saved seed in Rajasthan cost ratio for mothbean (%17516/ha and 1:2.17) than farmer practice (¥12537/ha and 1:1.88). On an average, a yield advantage of 137kg/ha was achieved by CFLDs adding to income of the farmers by ¥ 8197/ha. Improved varieties of mothbean under the CFLDs fetched distinct monetary advantage over the farmers’ saved seed/ variety. The improved varieties of mothbean proved advantageous in monetary returns by 19.6% with ‘RMO- 435’ at Jaisalmer conditions to 185.8% with mothbean “RMO-2251’ at Nagaur conditions (Fig. 3). Extension activities under CFLDs The farmers as well as KVKs scientific personnel were broadly capacitated through trainings/workshops and various extension activities viz. organizing field days, field visits by the scientists for crop monitoring and problem solving of farmers, experience sharing etc. In this context, in mothbean CFLDs, a total number of 17 extension activities were conducted with 724 actively involving participants during 2022. Similarly, 330 farmers were trained through 12 mothbean trainings conducted by the KVKs scientists and contributed by forwarding their feedback. CFLDs as an extension approach proved promising for all stakeholders in terms of (i) accessibility, (ii) operability of different interventions and periodic activities/events, and (iii) impacts to farmers of neighbouring villages due to the size of demonstrations and its visibility. Challenges experienced e Extreme weather conditions such as abrupt change in minimum and maximum temperatures beyond threshold level of tolerance caused flower abortion, hastened the reproductive period and lowered grain yield. e The edaphic factors like waterlogging is common feature of monsoon season cropping. Mothbean is sensitive to waterlogging and results in crop failure. e Lower productivity and low yield potential of mothbean as compared to cereals. Less allocation of resources and sub-optimal nutrition. e Inadequate availability of seed of improved varieties, vast gap in adoption of agronomic practices and other package of practices.
