 In this sub- category, the participation of farmers in water management, the resolution of conflicts due to water distribution and related problems (electricity availability), etc have been considered, which requires cooperation among farmers. All three of these social capitals (social, real and human) are inter­ connected and mutually supportive [11,17]. For example, if farmers have knowledge of water management; farmer can use water resources efficiently. Formal education and training on water management will help them access available knowledge. Additionally, a Farmer Producer Organization (FPO) supports most of the backward-forward links to sustainable agriculture and livelihoods that are difficult to form without social capital [14]. Only material capital (financial and infrastructural) cannot be the reason for successful agriculture. Similarly, it is very difficult to successfully adopt technology or packages of good agriculture practices (GAPs) without the support of a social dimension [1]. Most of the indicators under the capacity com­ ponents are tabulated (see Table 1). Use component mentioned in Table 1 measures the physical water use efficiency in cultivation. It measures the efficiency of agricultural water use. In this study, the ratio of crop yield to average annual rainfall, the ratio of crop yield to the number of irrigations during the crop cycle, and land abandoned due to water shortages are used as indicators of water use. Strengthening the capacity and water use components in the context of water management can have significant positive impacts on addressing water scarcity and promoting sustainable water manage­ ment. The capacity component focuses on improving farmers’ ability to manage water effectively, while the water use component focuses on the efficient use of water resources through appropriate technologies and practices. Here are potential benefits and positive impacts of strengthening capacity component: • Improved Water Management Knowledge and Skills (Human Capi­ tal): This enhances farmers’ understanding of water management practices, including irrigation scheduling, mulching, and precision farming techniques such as drip irrigation. This knowledge equips farmers to optimise water use and reduce waste. • Optimal Use of Water Infrastructure (Real Capital): This enables farmers to effectively utilise water infrastructure such as modern irrigation methods (e.g., drip, sprinkler) and efficient land levelling, maximising the efficiency of water application and minimising losses. • Better Conflict Resolution and Cooperation (Social Capital): This promotes cooperation among farmers, aiding in resolving conflicts related to water distribution and other issues. Effective conflict res­ olution ensures equitable water distribution, minimises disputes, and fosters a collaborative approach to water management.
