 Integrated application of NPK+FYM sustained maize productivity compared to N‐alone in Alfisols at Palampur (HP) www.icar.org.in 45 2002‐2007 Control 100% N 100% NPK+FYM Plate 2. Integrated application of NPK+FYM sustained soybean productivity compared to control and N‐alone in Alfisols at Ranchi • Data depicted in Fig. 2 on soil organic carbon (SOC) revealed that fertilization balance maintained SOC whereas incorporation of FYM resulted in build‐up in SOC in Alfisols of Bangalore and Palampur. At Ranchi, except NPK + FYM treatment decline in SOC is recorded. The results indicate that under high rainfall incorporation of FYM is essential to sustain soil productivity. Fig. 2.

For example, absence of K since last 34 years at Bangalore resulted in decline in yield by 33.8 q ha‐1 in finger millet and 14.7 q ha‐1 in maize. At Palampur also, absence of K declined maize yield to the extent of 12.2 q ha‐ 1 and wheat yield by 6.4 q ha‐1. Plate 3. Potassium : A growth limiting nutrient which adversely affected the productivity in Alfisols at Bangalore Sulphur is another growth limiting nutrients which adversely affect the productivity. At Bangalore absence of S from fertilizer schedule resulted in yield decline by nearly 2 q ha‐1 in finger millet and 3.5 q ha‐1 in maize (Plate 4). www.icar.org.in 47 2002‐2007 Plate 4. Sulphur : A growth limiting nutrient which adversely affected the productivity in Alfisols at Bangalore and Ranchi 100% NPK(‐S) Maize at Bangalore 100% NP Soybean at Ranchi At Palampur, 6.2 q ha‐1 decline in wheat yield was recorded due to S. Among the three Alfisols maximum decline in yield due to S was recorded at Ranchi. Through application of all the three nutrients (NPK) the crop productivity sustained at a respectable level but application of FYM or lime resulted in appreciable increase in yield particularly at Ranchi and Banglore. The findings suggest that to sustain the productivity in Alfisols year after year, application of either FYM or lime is essential. Table 4.
