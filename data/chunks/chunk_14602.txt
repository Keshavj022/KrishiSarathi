 From Table 6, the results show that an increase in age decreases food insecurity in India among urban farming households. Interestingly, in India also the results show a positive relationship between the extent of UA participation and food security. Thus, the extent of UA participation has a significant positive impact on the food security of households. Similarly, in New Delhi, Diehl et al. (2019) indicated that participation in UA had a positive relationship with food security status of participants households. From the field survey, it was realised that households were mainly engaged in mixed farming system along with the cultivation of vegetables like brinjal, okra, chilli, cauliflower, pointed gourd etc. and mostly goat-rearing. Very few households had milch cattle, including cow and buffaloes. Similar to the results from Ghana (kindly refer to Table 5 for details), increases in household size decreases the probability of being food insecure by approximately 12 units. A plausible reason could be that some people in the UA households are involved in other off-farm jobs, hence the possible increases in the per capita food expenditure. From both equations, expectedly, increases in household expenditure decrease the household food-insecurity status.

Effect of the extent of urban agriculture on food security in India IJSE 48,3 450 the results reveal that increases in the number of minutes from urban farms to the nearest market increase the food insecurity status of the household. One conceivable reason could be that; households might be buying foodstuffs from the market to supplement their food. Another reason could also be that, long distances decrease the ability of the households to sell their produce in the market for income hence are likely to have less money to spend on foods they do not produce.
