 Swarna × O.nivara BILs crosses were screened at field conditions and high yielding stable BILs were used to develop F2:3 mapping populations.104 Swarna × O.nivara BC2F8 BILs were phenotyped during Kharif 2014, 2015, 2016 for yield traits and a CSSLs set with 51 lines using 120 polymorphic SSR markers was identified. Major effect yield trait QTLs qPW5.1, qYLDP8.1 and qBY12.1 with phenotypic variance 15% to 48% were identified in each year. 94 backcross inbred lines of Swarna × Oryza nivara IRGC81848 (BC2F8) were field evaluated and genotyped using 118 polymorphic SSRs. These QTLs and CSSLs would be useful in dissecting yield traits and in rice breeding. ICAR National Fellow Scheme With an objective to provide support and develop strong centers of research and education around outstanding scientists, 25 ICAR National Fellow positions have been provided in National Agricultural Research System. Highlights of the ongoing projects are: Method for detecting the presence of any virus signal in clinical samples of fish developed: Interferon mediated cell signalling leads to elevated levels of an interferon stimulated gene (ISG) Mx. Mx protein, is an indicator of viral infection, an innate immune mechanism of host against viral infection. To develop a diagnostic tool for detecting any viral infection, an attempt was made by applying the expression of this ISG. Therefore, the complete coding region of Mx was identified from snow trout, Schizothorax richardsonii using RACE and sequenced (Accession number KU529282.1). The promoter of this gene was also identified and sequenced. Further, a construct, pGL3-Neo-GFP-MxPro, carrying green fluorescent protein as a reporter gene, is ready for further studies. Soy and multi-grain based nutritionally balanced functional foods for children developed: Eggless refined flour free cake rusks: Cake rusks were developed using RSM for optimization of time and temperature for the process of drying of refined flour free eggless cakes. The optimized time and temperature for drying each of the products were egg-Banana refined flour rusk (control)- 125 °C for 65 min, Egg-Banana composite flour rusk (T1)- 125 °C for 75 min and Eggless Banana composite flour rusk (T2)- 125°C for 100 min. The quality parameters of the developed rusks were compared to commercially available rusks in the market. The hardness (N) of T1-54 was highest followed by T2-53 and C -35. T2 was closest to the commercial rusk (53) in terms of hardness. Overall acceptability of the control was the highest at 9 followed by T2 at 8.5 on the 9 point hedonic scale. Composite flour laddoo was formulated using a mix of cereals, sprouted legumes, malted millet, dairy ingredients, fruit, oil and jaggery. The laddoo was significantly softer in texture, resulting in ease in biting, chewing and swallowing. The laddoo contained protein (24.6g), iron (10.4mg) and phosphorus (287.5mg), phenolics (123.0 GAE) mg flavonoids (6.9 QE) mg and antioxidant activity (62.
