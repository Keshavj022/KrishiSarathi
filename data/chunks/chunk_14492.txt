 The need for R&D to improve the functionalities of agricultural drones and its role in enabling the adoption of drones for agricultural activities is also acknowledged in various other studies [40]. Even if farmers for the farmers to the currently available drones by compromising the capa­ bilities of existing drones, attaining desired outcomes is inconceivable without precision in terms of spatial attributes. For these reasons, navigational accuracy, as second in the hierarchy of technical category is justifiable. The importance of navigational accuracy is also duly acknowledged by Boursianis et al. (2022) [68]. ‘Payload weight,’ third in the hierarchy with a relative dominance score of 0.168, is crucial especially for an agricultural drone as the payload is usually the spraying system filled with fertilisers. In the context of widely available drones, ‘payload weight’ is a major limitation owing to which the adoptability is restricted. If a drone can carry more payload weight, the chance of adoptability will increase which is also the observation made in the study by Khosta et al. (2022) [69]. Apart from these barriers in the technical category, ‘collision and crashing’ and ‘internet connectivity’, which are region specific, follow the priority order logically as these barriers are not a challenge in all of the scenarios. The implementation barrier category is next in the hierarchy after the technical category. The results suggest that if farmers, after looking at the benefits and capabilities of UAVs, get convinced that UAVs can boost their income and think of adopting UAVs, ‘Policy and Regulations’ set by the Government of India can be major barriers to their adoption. This is justifiable as farmers may find the guidelines extremely technical. This observation is in line with the conclusions drawn by Haffez et al. (2022) [4]. Even if policies are supportive, the ‘limited functionalities’ of UAV do not allow the farmer to utilize it in all phases of harvesting making it second in the hierarchy. This observation is in line with the outcomes of Hsieh et al. (2020) [70]. If farmers adopt UAVs, there will be a need for service centers but is not well established in the current scenario, especially in India. Therefore, ‘Access to service centers’ is the third on the priority list. For instance, if farmers adopt UAVs, there will be a need for service centers but is not well established in the current Table 2 Aggregated fuzzy score and the corresponding defuzzified.
