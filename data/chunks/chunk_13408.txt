 Further, yellow rust identification, documentation of entries with 100% yellow rust resistance, development of yellow rust resistant varieties to rising temperature, documents on the impact assessment of rust resistance breeding towards enhancing the total wheat production and productivity in India and, on the Ug99 resistant varieties, the Zn and Fe bio-fortified lines being developed should possess the multiple traits, e.g. heat tolerance, investigation on terminal heat tolerance in wheat with proper time line and undertaking gene mapping an action plan to be developed by the ICAR-IIWBR in collaboration with CIMMYT to achieve 9 t/ha wheat yield in India, for drought and salt tolerance ICAR-IIWBR should get material from CIMMYT and the trials to be done together. Wheat blast in Bangladesh is an emergent issue which is a threat to Indian wheat also and therefore, an action plan to be developed for India viewing the work done last year and also to be undertaken this year. In maize, temperate and spring maize be crossed for obtaining higher Kharif yield to the tune of 5 t/ha and keeping drought tolerance and disease resistance traits in programme, a note on mechanization in maize is to be prepared and technology packages which are developed and perfected should be promoted. There is a need for further evaluation/validation, up-scaling and field demonstrations of available technologies regarding burning of crop residues, initiation of work on aflatoxin in maize and studies on social impact of maize cultivation involving the ICAR-NCAP. ICAR-CGIAR Agricultural Cooperation 7 CIP would be concentrating on developing participatory approach for varietal improvement having tolerance to heat and drought stress, early maturing processing varieties and specialty potato varieties, the technology for seed production of potato in net house advanced in Bangladesh needs to be demonstrated in the fields in India, potato seed production and commercialization to be strengthened between CIP and CPRI and a plan is needed to scale up the potato seed production out of Punjab for example in West Bengal and Karnataka, ICAR-NCAP with ICAR-CPRI should study the water use efficiency in potato for sustainable intensification, and mini processing plants for making flour, noodles, starch etc. should be worked upon so that the products may find place in nutritional programmes. In sweet potato, release of varieties of sweet potato should be through AICRP and there should be participatory evaluation, transfer of sweet potato value addition technologies to households and small and medium entrepreneurs to be undertaken by CPRI with assistance of CIP, and popularization of orange flesh sweet potato varieties should be given more emphasis in tribal areas.
