 Multimodal sensors: Future smart sensors may combine multiple sensing modalities, such as optical, thermal, and hyperspectral imaging, to provide a comprehensive view of crop health and environmental conditions. Integrating diverse data sources will enable more accurate and sophisticated analytics for precision agriculture. AI and machine learning algorithms will increasingly play a signiﬁcant role in analyzing sensor data. These tech- nologies will provide predictive insights, optimize resource allocation, and automate decision-making processes to enhance crop management. Edge computing and on-device analytics: Edge comput- ing, where data processing occurs locally on the sensor device, will gain prominence. On-device analytics will enable real-time data analysis, reducing reliance on cloud-based solutions, and improving response times for critical agricul- tural tasks [54]. Sensor fusion and data integration: The research will focus on integrating data from multiple sensors and sources, including satellite imagery and drones, to enhance the accu- racy and comprehensiveness of agricultural data analysis. Energy harvesting and self-powering sensors: Developing smarts capable of gathering energy from the surroundings, like solar, motion-based, or heat energy, will reduce depen- dence on external power sources and extend the sensors’ operational lifespan. Smart material-based sensors: Advancements in smart materials, such as nanomaterials and biodegradable poly- mers, will lead to the development of eco-friendly and sus- tainable smart sensors for precision agriculture. Cloud-based data analytics: Cloud-based data analytics platforms will evolve to efﬁciently process vast amounts of sensor data from multiple farms, facilitating large-scale data- driven decision-making and providing valuable insights for agribusinesses and policymakers. Autonomous sensor networks: Research will focus on developing self-conﬁguring and self-optimizing sensor net- works that can autonomously adapt to changing agricultural conditions and optimize data collection. Overall, these emerging trends in smart sensor technolo- gies for precision agriculture hold great potential to revolu- tionize the way farming is practiced. Continued research, development, and adoption of these technologies will con- tribute to increased agricultural productivity, sustainabil- ity, and resource efﬁciency, addressing the challenges of feeding a growing global population while preserving the environment. 7.2.
