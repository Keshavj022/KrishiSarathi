  Captive broodstock is raised in concrete tanks/earthen ponds @ 2-3 nos/m2 with intermittent water exchange and fed with compound feed containing 30-35% protein.  Matured brooders of 100-150 g are easily identified by pointed and round genital papilla for male and female, respectively. The females are injected with Ovaprim/Ovatide/Wova-FH/ GonoproFH @ 1.0-1.5 ml/kg body weight.  Females are stripped after 16-17 h post injection and fertilized with the sperm suspension prepared from the dissected testis of male prior to female stripping. Female of 100 g gives 4,000-5,000 eggs.  Eggs are round, dark brown and adhesive. Fertilized eggs after 3-4 washing after stripping are transferred to the hatchery tubs/tanks.  The eggs are hatched in 24-26 h and yolk-sac is absorbed in 70-80 h.  Spawn is reared in indoor tanks @ 1,000-1,500/m2 for about two weeks. Larvae are fed with live feed followed by compound larval feed to obtain a survival level of 80% at fry stage.  The breeding and seed production technology has been adopted in several states of the country, especially in West Bengal, Odisha, Assam and other north eastern states.

They are injected with carp pituitary extract @ 20-40 mg/kg.  After a latency period of 13-14 h, injected female fishes are either stripped out and eggs are fertilized with pre-driven milt as in C. magur or a hide-out is provided in the tank for their natural spawning. In both the cases, the fertilization rate of 60-95% is achieved.  Fertilized eggs are incubated in flow-through hatchery system in shallow trays. A female of 200 g size lays approximates 5,000 eggs, which hatch in 16-18 h at 26-28°C.  Newly hatched larvae are fed with chicken egg yolk suspension for the first two days and thereafter fed ad lib with freshly hatched Artemia nauplii for at least 10 days in shallow trays/ tanks with water depth of 10-12 cm.  Inert feed in the form of thick paste is started from 10 days onwards along with the Artemia nauplii, which is gradually withdrawn, and larvae are totally weaned on formulated diet.
