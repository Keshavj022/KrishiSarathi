 These outcomes suggest that mango bagging technology, along with other good agricultural practices, not only improved the quality and marketability of the fruit but Demonstration of bagging on trees and grading of bagged Dashehari mango Demonstration of bagging, desapping and packing of bagged Chousa mango also enhanced the socio-economic standing of farmers in the mango industry. CONCLUSION The Malihabad fruit belt of Lucknow in central Uttar Pradesh is known for its delicious Dashehari mango variety, while the fruit belts of Siyana, Bulandshahar, and Saharanpur in Western Uttar Pradesh are famous for the Chousa mango. Demonstration of good agricultural practices in both clusters proved to be a valuable investment for mango farmers. This technology not only improved fruit quality and reduced post-harvest losses but also significantly enhanced the market value of the produce, leading to substantial economic benefits for farmers. As more farmers embrace this innovation, the overall quality of mango production in the region is expected to improve, contributing to the growth and sustainability of the agricultural sector. The success story of this project highlights the importance of innovative technologies and farmer collaboration in achieving agricultural prosperity. *Corresponding author email: ravisc3@gmail.com Indian Farming 18 October 2024 Goat rearing : A sustainable subsidiary occupation for livelihood security Kuldeep Singh*, Pankaj Kumar and Parminder Singh Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, Punjab 141 004 The Farmer FIRST Programme (FFP) by ICAR focuses on empowering farmers by involving them directly in research and solution-oriented activities for sustainable agriculture. In Sangrur, Punjab, the program targeted crop diversification and introduced subsidiary occupations, including goat rearing, as alternatives to the traditional wheat-paddy cycle. Recognizing goat rearing's low input and minimal land needs, the FFP facilitated training, resources, and marketing support for landless labourers and small farmers. The Beetle breed was chosen for its high milk yield and adaptability, and farmers were provided starter units of goats. With ongoing support from FFP, farmers have turned goat rearing into a profitable enterprise. This initiative has enhanced financial stability and livelihood security for landless labourers, reducing dependency on monoculture and fostering sustainable economic growth in rural communities. Keywords: Farmer FIRST, Goat rearing, Livelihood security, Sangrur, Subsidiary occupation T HE Farmer FIRST Programme (FFP) of ICAR was developed to place farmers at the center, enabling them to identify, prioritize, and conduct research and manage experimental projects in real-world farming settings. The programme’s key focus areas include the farmer’s Farm, Innovations, Resources, Science, and Technology (FIRST). Farmers often face challenges in production and resource management, lacking viable solutions.
