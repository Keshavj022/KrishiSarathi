 Natural farming has emerged as a beacon of hope in modern agriculture, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional farming practices. In recent years, the importance of natural farming has garnered widespread attention due to its potential to address pressing challenges. At its core, natural farming emphasizes working in tandem with nature’s rhythms rather than against them. By harnessing the inherent resilience and complexity of natural ecosystems, this approach seeks to nurture healthy soils, enhance biodiversity, and promote the well-being of farmers and communities. Recognizing the significance of natural farming, ICAR initiated a nationwide project titled ‘Out-scaling of Natural Farming through KVKs, in 2022. In ATARI Zone-IX, the project is being implemented across 48 KVKs in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to promote and expand the adoption of natural farming practices via Krishi Vigyan Kendras. Within this initiative, the crucial components focused are promoting natural farming practices, capacity building for farmers, demonstrations and trials, scaling up, and knowledge sharing and documentation of natural farming practices.

To meet this rising demand sustainably, it is imperative to transition towards sustainable agriculture practices. The excessive use of chemicals and fertilizers has led to the rapid deterioration of soil fertility, posing significant environmental risks. Synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are not only polluting the environment but also contributing to soil degradation. Natural farming offers a sustainable and resilient approach to agriculture, aligning with principles of ecological balance and biodiversity conservation. In natural farming, practices such as ploughing and tilling of soil are eliminated, and synthetic fertilizers are replaced withnatural alternatives. Farm-made pesticides derived from natural sources are utilized to control pests and diseases, promoting healthier ecosystems and soil fertility. Natural farming represents a chemical-free agricultural system deeply rooted in Indian tradition, enriched with modern ecological insights, resource recycling, and on-farm resource optimization. It embodies an agro-ecology- based diversified farming system that seamlessly integrates crops, trees, and livestock with functional biodiversity. Central to natural farming is the on-farm recycling of biomass, emphasizing practices such as biomass mulching, the use of on-farm cow dung-urine formulations, and the maintenance of soil aeration. An essential aspect of natural farming is the exclusion of all synthetic chemical inputs, promoting sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural practices.
