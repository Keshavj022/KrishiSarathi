 Aeroponic techniques have proven to be commercially successful for propagation, seed germination, seed potato production, tomato production, leaf crops, and micro-greens. Primarily, it was used in dry regions of the world, now becoming popular in urban areas. It is now popular in India, and chance of success is high in populated city like Delhi. Hydroponics Hydroponics is the method of growing plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent. Terrestrial plants may be grown with only their roots exposed to the mineral solution, or the roots may be supported by an inert medium, such as perlite or gravel. The nutrients in hydroponics can come from an array of different sources; these can include but are not limited to byproduct from fish waste, duck manure, or normal nutrients. It is the modern technology farming in which plant growth and productivity is controlled by water and its nutrients level in the water. In this technique, water is enriched with well-balanced nutrients which are essential for plant growth and better yield. Water level pH will be maintained within the specific range which results in better growth and produce. Vertical farming Vertical farming is the practice of producing food and medicine in vertically stacked layers, vertically inclined surfaces and/or integrated in other structures (such as in a skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container). The modern ideas of vertical farming use indoor farming techniques and controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) technology, where all environmental factors can be controlled. These facilities utilize artificial control of light, environmental control (humidity, temperature, gases) and fertigation. A vertical farm grows plants and produce in a vertical orientation, maximizing the use of the location’s square footage. Most often this is achieved through the use of growing shelves suspended on a wall or fence. Because vertical farming uses so little space, it is a popular and preferred method for roof-top and other urban forms of agriculture. 6.3 Summary and Recommendations Trade and commerce have played a pivotal role in promoting the growth of Delhi’s economy by making a significant contribution in terms of tax revenues and providing gainful employment to a large section of the society. Delhi is the biggest trade and consumption centre in North India. Agricultural produce has a formidable share in this market with the biggest mandi of State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 132 Asia is in Delhi. Appropriate steps therefore are to be taken to enable Delhi farmers to take full advantage of the trade. The following recommendations are proposed to double the income and farmers by increasing the profitability of agricultural and allied activities in Delhi:   To increase agricultural production, the state needs more irrigation facility. A higher irrigation ratio will facilitate higher crop intensity and will increase production.
