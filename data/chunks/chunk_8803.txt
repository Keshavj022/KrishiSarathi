 KRH 2, PHB 71 and Sahyadri, high-yielding and widely adapted rice hybrids, have showed yield advantage ranging from 882 to 1,110 kg/ha in rabi and 495-665 kg/ha in kharif. New CMS lines developed: Two new CMS lines, CRMS 31A, and CRMS 32A, for developing rice hybrids for both irrigated and shallow lowlands have been developed. Promising Thermo-Genetic Male Sterile (TGMS) line: MLTG 4 is the most promising Thermo-Genetic Male Sterile (TGMS) line for developing two-line hybrids, with clear transformation from sterility to fertility and vice versa. Biotechnology: The PCR-based sequence tagged site (STS) marker could distinguish A and B lines. In multiplex reaction with another primer pTA 248, 2 A lines, IR 58025A and IR 62829A have been distinguished. Crop Production Polythene tunnel method for raising rice seed nursery has been developed to overcome low temperatures, ranging from 5 to 10Â°C during boro season sowing in the north-eastern regions. This is for ensured seedling growth and also for reduced plant mortality. Poly rice, a commercial formulation containing NPK along with micronutrients, when applied to leaves at 2% concentration at panicle initiation, one week before and one week after flowering along with the recommended fertilizer dose, applied as soil application, increased grain yield by 24% over recommended fertilizers. In hybrid rice PA 6201, N was applied at 135 kg N/ha in 4 equal splits: basal, 21 days after transplanting, at panicle initiation and at panicle emergence. This along with 45 kg P2O5 and 90 kg K2O in dry season had resulted in 12% increase in yield over check. Direct seeding of sprouted seed along with the optimized crop-management package by eight-row drum seeder has recorded comparable grain yield to that of transplanting in Tulasi, Krishnahamsa, IET 9994, IET 9219, IET 9691 and Vikas rice; out of the 23 cultivars/varieties tested. Almix (a new herbicide) at 0.004 kg a.i./ha along with the early post-emergence application of Butachlor at 1.5 kg a.i./ha was found effective for weed control. Final growth trend analysis of 10-year study on intensive rice-rice cultivation indicated a low positive growth of kharif rice productivity and a decline in rabi rice yields by 2% per annum despite sufficient levels of fertilizer applied. Crop Protection Pusa RH 10 is a hybrid for irrigated areas of Haryana, Delhi and Uttaranchal. It has showed moderate resistance to brown planthopper and rice tungro virus PROMISING RICE CULTURES Ecosystem Promising culture (IET No.) Rainfed upland 16804, 16806 15164, 15828 Deep water 16847, 16850 Saline/Sodic 16888, 13428 Irrigated 15948, 15949 (E) 16130, 16253 (ME) 16007, 16479, 16075,16434 (M) Semi-deep water 16472, 16473 Costal saline 15420, 13428 Boro 12884, 8886, 8883 High altitude area 16468, 16047, 16007, 16479 16457, 16009 KRH 2 is a high-yielding, widely adapted rice hybrid.
