 Sensors are the most integral part of the automation required for overall management of fertigation, microclimate, IPM, harvesting and overall supervision and monitoring of the system. Sensors data are used for AI, ML and IoT based modelling for overall management of the soilless cultivation based models. Smart urban farming in soilless cultivation often utilizes a variety of specialized sensors to optimize plant growth and health. Climatic sensors monitor environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and light levels, ensuring ideal growth conditions. Fertigation sensors regulate nutrient and water delivery systems for precise plant feeding, while water quality sensors maintain safe pH and mineral levels. Disease monitoring sensors provide early detection of potential issues, allowing timely interventions. Plant and leaf sensors measure plant health metrics such as hydration and nutrient absorption, and fruit quality sensors monitor parameters like size and ripeness, helping to ensure high-quality produce. Together, these sensors create an integrated approach to efficient and sustainable urban farming. Centre for Protected Cultivation Technology (IARI) has developed complete system and package for vegetable crops. SUMMARY Sensors are now commonly used for overall supervision, monitoring and management of soilless cultivation based commercial greenhouse entrepreneurship for growing high-value vegetables and flowers. Sensors are integrated with controller for IoT based app popularly used by growers, which can be integrated with smartphone. AI and ML based advanced modelling also requires sensor data for the efficient management of the system. Fertigation, climatic, IPM, Plant health based sensors etc. are commonly used by farmers and growers in soilless cultivation based growing system. For further interaction, please write to: Dr M.

The technique involves wounding/incision on branches with diameter of 5 mm at 30 cm above ground level using sharp knife/blade to remove the bark followed by application of 2,500 ppm IBA as rooting hormone. The treatment starts from the second week of June till the last week of August. Small polybags (filled with rooting medium) are fastened at the points where rooting needs to be initiated. A lightweight substrate (cocopeat) having high moisture holding capacity is used as rooting medium. Staking is accomplished with the help of bamboo poles to hold the bags in a proper position and to keep the plants straight.
