 During 1988 to 1996 the mix of composites, double, double top, top, and three-way cross hybrids were followed to maximize the maize productivity. Till 1988 in India almost 100% maize area was covered by the public bred cultivars or local landraces. In the 1990s, the single cross hybrid (SCH) program was started with the adoption of a new seed policy and the first single cross hybrid ‘Paras’ was released by the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. After 1996, the maize research was shifted to single-cross hybrid development only. The maize productivity increased from 1.8 t ha-1 in 1997-2006 to 3.19 t ha-1 primarily due adoption of single-cross hybrid technology (Fig. 3). Achievements in Field Crops in Independent India 87 The discovery of two mutants namely, Opaque-2 (O2) containing high lysine and tryptophan and flory-2 (fl2) having relatively more methionine in the 1960s, diverted the maize research towards quality protein maize (QPM). The QPM has 2-3 folds more lysine and tryptophan compared to normal maize. In 1971, three composites, viz., Shakti, Rattan, and Protina were released containing Opaque-2 mutant. However, these composites did not become popular due to their chalky look and soft endosperm, which made it more susceptible to storage insect pests. To address this issue first hard endosperm composite Shakti1 was released with opaque-2 and desired modifier in 1997.The first three-way cross QPM hybrid, Shaktiman 1 was released in 2001 and single-cross hybrid, Shaktiman 2 in 2004. These hybrids were white seeded with little acceptance. Subsequently, the first yellow colour hybrid QPM namely Shaktiman 3 and Shaktiman 4 were released in 2006. The first MAS-derived QPM hybrid, QPM Vivek 9 was released in 2008. Subsequently, a series of MAS-derived QPM hybrids viz., Pusa HM8 Improved (AQH8), Pusa HM 9 Improved (AQH9), and Pusa HM4 Improved (AQH4) in 2017 and Pusa VH 27 Improved, Pusa HQPM 5 Improved, Pusa HQPM 7 Improved in 2020 were released. The development of vitamins and micronutrient enriched hybrids in maize is the recent focus to improve the nutritional quality of maize. The first provitamin-A rich hybrid ‘Pusa Vivek QPM 9 Improved’ was released in 2017. Speciality corn includes sweet corn, baby corn, and popcorn, which became more popular in recent years due to its diverse applications. The VL 54 was the first popcorn composite released in 1982. The first sweet corn variety, Madhuri was released in 1990 and baby corn variety, VL 78 was released in 2004. A normal corn hybrid, HM 4 was released in 2005 which gained much popularity among farmers for baby corn purposes. Later on, number of hybrids were released which are specifically bred for baby corn, sweet corn, and popcorn. In the case of baby corn, IMHB 1532, IMHB 1539, LBCH 3, VL 78, VL Baby corn 1, VL Baby corn 2. Similarly, for sweet corn, Pusa super sweet corn 1 & 2, VL sweet corn hybrid 1 & 2 were released. In the same way, popcorn hybrids viz.
