This table restricts to those that reported growing pulses at midline and were therefore eligible for both endline survey modes. Top panel reports questions asked to all households; bottom panel reports questions asked to extended subsample. Columns 1–3 report sample mean and standard deviation; Columns 4–5 report difference in means from (1) and standard error of difference clustered at the village level. *** Indicate significance at the 1 percent critical level. ** Indicate significance at the 5 percent critical level. * Indicate significance at the 10 percent critical level. effect accounts for between 64% and 90% of the average difference across surveys. Only for fava beans is the average production gap within respondent less than half of that in the full sample. Within-respondent differences reflect the pure effect of survey mode on the same individual answering the same question. This calcula- tion eliminates heterogeneity caused by both selective attrition across households and by within-household selection of who responds. The latter channel, arising when different members participate in different survey types, can be considered part of the survey mode effect at the household level. Within-household survey mode effects, net of both the direct effect on respondents and household member selection, may be more informative for research design because attrition and the resulting bias can be measured, but researchers cannot know whether the same individual would have responded to different modes of contact. Household-level survey mode effects explain an even greater portion of the production gap in general. The right column of Fig. 2 compares differences in self-reported production by survey mode in the full sam- ple to differences in the sample of overlapping households, represented by the dashed line. The overlapping household sample, consisting of the 429 households in the overlapping respondent sample plus an additional 155 households in which different respondents answered each survey, tracks the full sample more closely across production deciles. For the two main project crops – pigeon peas and red lentils – the shift from within-respondent to within-household comparisons increases the explanatory power of survey mode effects – from 85% to 93% and 87% to 99%, respectively. Moreover, for fava beans, the portion of the average production gap explained by household- level survey mode effects climbs to 81% with the addition of several households in which the primary farmers reports low production in person and another member reports higher production over the phone.
