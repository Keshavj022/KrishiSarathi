Basic and strategic research on productivity and production enhancement of cattle including indigenous cattle. 2. Dissemination of scientific information and technology for cattle production management. Activities:  Increasing cattle productivity using the latest breeding tools.  Enhancement of cattle productivity through reproductive techniques.  Use of nutritional and management interventions for optimization of cattle productivity.  HRD and technology dissemination. AICRP on Cattle  Conservation and genetic improvement of important indigenous cattle breeds.  Production of progeny tested crossbred bulls and genetic improvement of cattle under field conditions. 3. Salient achievements 1. Improvement of 24-36% in the milk production potential of indigenous cattle breeds viz., Gir (from 1875 to 2564 Kg), Kankrej (1670 to 2004 Kg) and Sahiwal (1575 to 1958 Kg) Sahiwal under the Indigenous Breeds Project (IBP). 2. Evolved a national milch cattle “FrieswalTM” having a stable inheritance of 62.5% HF and 37.5% Sahiwal involving >68000 lactation records of # animals maintained at 37 Military Farms (MoD) at different agro-climatic regions of the country and potential to yield > 7000 Kg of milk in lactation with a maximum peak yield of 41 Kg in a day. 3. Developed a standardized methodology for large-scale Field Progeny Testing (FPT) involving the farmers’ herds. 4. Up to 60% improvement in the first lactation milk yield of crossbred animals maintained at the farmers’ herd at project operating areas in GADVASU (42.86%), Ludhiana, Punjab; KVASU (60.35%), Thrissur, Kerala; BAIF (10.9%); Pune, Maharashtra and GBPUAT 165 Animal Sciences 165 (41.64%), Pantnagar, Uttarakhand under the Field Progeny Testing (FPT) programme. 5. Developed real-time data entry software for AICRP on Cattle named “Systematic Information Resources for Dairy Animal Management-SIReDAM” (Web link: http://webtom.cabgrid.res. in/SIReDAM/I) 6. Produced more than 47 lakhs doses of frozen semen and distributed more than 27 lakhs doses. Currently, semen doses of around 20 lakhs of Frieswal and 224085 of Gir, 123991 of Kankrej and 144801 of Sahiwal are available for meeting the breeding demand of the country. 7.
