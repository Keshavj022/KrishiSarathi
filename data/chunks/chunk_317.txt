The genesis of this transformative period can be traced back to a pivotal moment when the proposal for the International Year of Millets was put forth by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Rome on 4 October 2018, wherein undersigned presented the proposal on behalf of the Government of India. Today, as we reflect on the conclusion of this endeavour, we stand proud witnesses to a renaissance—one fueled by innovation, sustainability, and a collective dedication to our nation's agricultural landscape. In the rich canvas of India's agricultural landscape, millets have woven a story of sustenance and prosperity for centuries.
