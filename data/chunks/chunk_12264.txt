 Male parent MIR 525-2, developed at the AICPMIP, Jodhpur b) Source of material in case of introduction : NA c) DNA profile of variety/hybrid/inbred/A, B, R line of Attached the hybrid vis-Ã -vis check variety/ line d) Breeding method used : Pedigree and backcross breeding for parental lines and heterosis breeding for hybrid e) Breeding objective : High and stable yields, resistance to downy mildew, blast and other diseases 6 State varieties which most closely resemble the : RHB 121 (Alternative to ICMH 356, Pusa 23 and proposed hybrid in general characters GHB 744) 7 Recommended production ecology (rainfed/irrigated; : Rainfed, kharif, both high and low fertility high/low fertility; season) 8 Specific area of its adaptation (zones and states for : Zone A of the AICPMIP, comprising states of which variety is proposed) and the recommended Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya production ecologies Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi 9 Description of hybrid/variety : a) Plant height : 179 cm (175 - 185 cm) (Table 5; Annexures VI, VII, VIII, IX, X) b) Distinguishing morphological characters : Hybrid MPMH 17 possesses yellow anthers, has pubescence at nodes, shows complete exertion and has long brown bristles that are very helpful in reducing bird damage in crop (Annexure I) Anthocyanin pigmentation of glumes and tip sterility are absent in hybrids as well as in both parental lines (Contd) 195 GUIDELINES FOR TESTING CROP VARIETIES UNDER AICCIPS of the hybrid. The flowering time of both parental lines is similar (47 days) (Table 3; Annexure IV), and thus no problem in nicking is encountered in certified seed production plots of the hybrid. c) Maturity (range in number of days) (from seedling/ : 79 days (Table 4; Annexure V) transplanting to flowering, seed- to- seed) d) Maturity group (early, medium and late wherever : Medium such classification exists) e) Reaction to major diseases under field and : Highly resistant to downy mildew. Highly resistant to controlled conditions (reaction to physiological blast (Table 7; Annexure XI) strains/ races/pathotypes/ bio-types needs to be indicated, wherever possible) f) Reaction to major pests (under field and controlled : Resistant to stem borer, shoot-fly (Table 8) condition, including storage pests) g) Agronomic features (e.g. resistance to lodging, : Highly responsive to fertilizers and suitable for both shattering, fertilizer responsiveness, suitability to early and late planting (Table 6) early or late sown conditions, seed rate etc.
