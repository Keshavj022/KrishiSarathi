(Saccharum spontaneum) Biodiversity Act, 2002 has been conferred the status of International Depositary Authority (IDA) under the Budapest Treaty by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 2020. At present, the total number of holdings in NAIMCC is 7,385 (Bacteria-2864, Fungi-4174, Cyanobacteria-347). During the period under report, 107 agriculturally important microbial cultures were accessioned which includes 253 bacteria, 79 fungi and 4 cyanobacteria. The new microbial species introduced to NAIMCC include 58 bacteria, 5 fungi and 6 cyanobacteria. Orrelladio scoreae, Rhizobium binae, R. multihospitium, Sinomona satrocynae, Pseudo- arthrobacter niigatensis, Halomonas sulfidaeris, Kribella karoonensis, Lutoibacter jiangsuensis, Nocardiopsis flavescens, Sarocladium implicatum, Setosphaeria rostrata, Lichtheimia hyalospora, Themosyne chococcus elongates, Chroogloeocystis siderophila represent some of the newly introduced microbial species. Seventeen microbial cultures used in agriculture and in particular as biopesticides were deposited by public and private institutions under safe deposit. About 227 cultures were supplied to both academia and industry. Description of new species: A moderately halophilic, Gram negative, aerobic bacterium belonging to the genus Halomonas was isolated from soil of Pentha beach, Odisha. Based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic characteristics, strain D1-1T represents a novel species in the genus Halomonas for which the name Halomonas icarensis sp. nov. have been given. Insect resources ICAR-National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (NBAIR) is mandated for the collection, cataloguing and conservation of insects and related organisms of agricultural importance like mites, spiders and nematodes associated with arthropods covering all the agro ecosystems of the country. The National Insect Repository located at ICAR-NBAIR is recognized by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India as the National Repository for agriculturally important insects, spiders and mites under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 on 12 September 2012. During the period (2020â€“21), 2,846 insects were collected and curated. A total of 91,676 dead insect specimens are being maintained at the National Insect Repository of ICAR-NBAIR. One new genus and 44 new species of insects described. New records for India includes 10 genera and 10 species of insects. The invasive mealybug, Phenacoccus manihoti (Pseudococcidae: Hemiptera) has been recorded in cassava for the first time and it poses severe threat to cassava production in India.
