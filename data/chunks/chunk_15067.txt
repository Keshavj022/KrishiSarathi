 Environment sustainability: Subsistence cultivators frequently adopt environmentally friendly methods such as organic farming, short- duration crop varieties, flood and drought-resistant crops, and insect- resistant varieties, often incorporating renewable energy and hydroponics-based agriculture (van Etten et al., 2019; Naab et al., 2019). Predicative ability: Utilizing the best available information and tech- nology for managing climate change impacts, focusing on hydro- meteorological data, enhances the system’s capacity to anticipate and respond to environmental changes (Paparrizos et al., 2023). Flexibility: Access to credit and financing is crucial for rural families, as it facilitates economic growth by boosting agricultural yields, reducing input costs, and increasing resilience to climate change (Singh et al., 2018). Therefore, crop management strategies, water conserva- tion techniques, and technological setups should be adjusted to facilitate adaptable operations. Easily measurable: Understanding CRA adaptation methods, including financial gains, carbon emission reductions, and environ- mental and health benefits, is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of sustainable agronomic practices (Zobeidi et al., 2024). Redundancy: The cultivation of low-carbon crops such as rice, groundnuts, finger millet, and foxtail millet helps assess the mitigation potential and ensures stability in production despite climate variability (Tiwari et al., 2014). Community development: Engaging entities like SHGs, NGOs, and educational institutions in capacity building supports the integrated development of CRA at the micro-level (Sivakami and Shamala, 2021). Social equalization: Addressing issues of caste and gender discrimi- nation within CRA promotes inclusivity and equitable access to re- sources (Pyakurel, 2021). Adaptation: Studies should pay attention to the different aspects that influence the farmers’ adaptation and vulnerability rather than only concentrating on how they perceive CRA. This encompasses individuals’ perceptions of the stressors they face, their efforts to reduce vulnera- bility, and their ability to adapt to climate change. Formulating effective policy responses grounded in farmers’ adaptations and their views on climate change is essential. The researchers will be able to pinpoint the weaknesses in the current policies and increase their efficacy using a participative method (Datta et al., 2022). Social networks: Participating in social networks is one of the most crucial things that farmers should consider when adopting climate- resilient techniques. They can easily convert seeds through these net- works and recover the adoption of new types suitable for their climate. The advancement of seed development plans was aided by the input of different social networks, including seed banks, farmer clusters, seed organizations, and intra-community or neighborhood systems (Acevedo et al., 2020). 8.
