The probability of receiving the overflowing rain events ranged from 10 to 28%. CONCLUSION When the indigenous rain-gauge was full, sorghum + pigeonpea were sown by all the framers within 3 days, which technically amounts to 50 mm in the standard rain-gauge. Sowings can be continued for 2 more days. With this, it fulfils the claim made by the discloser. But the claim gets vitiated under delayed monsoon conditions, because the season to sow sorghum + pigeonpea would be lost for the fear of sorghum shootfly attack, and the farmer will prefer to sow castor instead of sorghum + pigeonpea. Low price of the indigenous rain-gauge made of granite ranging from Rs 250 to 300, which can be made by the local mason, and its less proneness to theft over the standard rain-gauge are the major advantages. □ Contents RAIN WATER MANAGEMENT Code Title of the ITK Description of the ITK Name and address of the discloser Location of use of the ITK : 599 Method of rain-water management in mountainous land scape under apple orchard : In several parts of the Himalayas, villages are located at the foot-hills or valleys. Villagers often harvest rain water by building small water-storage "ponds (locally called chaal).The number of such ponds varies from 30 to 40 depending upon the valleys and villages. Each water pond is 9 m long, 9 m wide and 0.9 m deep. During rainy season water gets stored in these ponds, which not only act as water reservoir for the villagers but also control the floods in the low hill areas during rainy season. The water collected in the ponds is not used for human drinking purpose, but provides drinking water for cattle and for irrigation purposes. This is in practice for the past several years. : Shri Prem Singh Verma, Gawahi village, Sandhu P.O., Theog tehsil, Shimla (Himachal Pradesh) 171 222 : Different villages in the foot-hills or valleys of the Himalayas were considered. The experimental site is an apple orchard, located at village Gawahi, which is 45 km from Shimla city on national highway 22 (commonly called Hindustan-Tibet Road) and 8 km from Theog town, which is a gateway to apple belt of Shimla district. The orchard is of about 3 ha area, at 2,400 m above MSL, which was established 10 years ago. Experimenters : Dr Pradeep K. Sharma, Chief Scientist (WM), Dr O.C.
