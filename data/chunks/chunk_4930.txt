 To maximize their impact, developers should prioritize user-friendly design, offline functionality, and robust data security, ensuring that these applications remain accessible and trustworthy, especially for farmers in remote areas with limited connectivity. As technology continues to evolve, the potential for further advancements in agricultural practices will only grow, significantly enhancing the economic viability of smallholder farmers and contributing to the sustainability of rural economies. This digital transformation is beneficial for individual farmers and essential for advancing global food security and improving the overall livelihoods of those in the horticulture sector. Adopting these tools will pave the way for a more productive and sustainable agricultural future.

November–December 2024 81 High-throughput phenotyping in horticultural crops: Innovations, challenges, and the path ahead Image-based phenotyping has become vital in the breeding, cultivation, and quality assessment of economically important crops. This article examines its advancements and applications in horticultural crops, highlighting imaging techniques such as RGB, thermal, hyperspectral, fluorescence, and tomographic imaging. These methods enable high-throughput phenotyping across various traits, including morphology, physiology, biochemistry, diseases, pests, and abiotic stresses. In addition to accelerating breeding cycles through rapid trait measurement, image-based phenotyping supports real-time monitoring and quick decision-making for activities like pesticide application, fertilization, and harvesting, ultimately improving yield and produce quality. It also plays a crucial role in postharvest phenotyping, ensuring quality during storage and handling. With its impact on both yield and product quality, image-based phenotyping is integral to the entire horticultural chain. The integration of machine learning and deep learning technologies is key to efficiently extracting valuable insights from the extensive data generated. Technology Madhurima Das, Chanumolu H. G. K., Sudhir Kumar and Viswanathan C* N ON-invasive, image-based high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), coupled with advanced data analytics, is key to bridging the genotype-phenotype gap, accelerating genetic advancements in crop breeding. Deep phenotyping enables exploration of genetic factors underlying traits like stress tolerance and yield enhancement.
