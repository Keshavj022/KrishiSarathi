 pH sensors are integrated into irrigation or soil systems to offer continuous pH readings. This allows farmers to choose the right crops, manage water treatment techniques or soil additions, and avoid nutrient imbalances.

Agricultural Robots: Traditional farming methods can be significantly altered by agricultural robots, sometimes known as "Agri-robots." These highly developed devices are made to automate a variety of agricultural chores, from planting and harvesting to maintenance and monitoring. Robotics utilization improves output, consistency, safety, and quality of goods. Following are the types of agricultural robots: 3. Remote Sensing and Satellite Imagery in Agriculture Precision agriculture relies heavily on satellite imaging and remote sensing, which can provide farmers and other agricultural stakeholders with insightful information. The process of gathering data about things or locations without making direct physical contact is known as remote sensing. It can be extremely important in agriculture for maintaining and keeping an eye on soil, crops, and environmental factors. For applications involving remote sensing, satellites are an essential platform. Large agricultural regions can be viewed comprehensively with satellite images. These technologies could lead to better overall farm management, resource optimization, and data-driven decision-making. This technique can be employed crop monitoring and health assessment, yield prediction, soil moisture monitoring, drought monitoring and prediction, land and crop mapping. Autonomous Tractors and Machinery: Precision activities like ploughing, sowing, and harvesting can be carried out by autonomous tractors that are equipped with GPS, sensors, and navigation systems. Planters, sprayers, and harvesters are examples of smart tools and machines that can run independently or with little human input, saving labour costs and improving efficiency. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Drones: Aerial surveillance and monitoring of crops, livestock, and fields is made possible by UAVs and drones that are fitted with cameras, sensors, and imaging technology. Drones facilitate early intervention and decision-making by assessing crop health, detecting diseases, identifying insect infestations, and monitoring environmental conditions. Robotic Harvesters and Pickers: With the ability to precisely choose fruits, vegetables, and crops, robotic harvesters can minimize damage and harvesting time. Automated harvesting of ripe fruit, leaving the unripe or damaged crops, is made possible by robotic arms, grippers, and vision systems.
