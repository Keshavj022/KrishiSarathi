 This is the reason of worry about litchi stink bug. Some of the points that should be considered in favour of threats include: Longer life cycle and high fecundity of pest; quick buildup of pest population which coinciding flowering and fruit set in litchi and continuing till fruit matures; contiguous and abundant availability of host tree to a introduced invasive pest; though insecticidal spray has a quick ‘knock down’ effect, but even if a few insects escapes/ avoid insecticidal spray (say 5%) on a single tree, it will be sufficient to build up its population to a level enabling infestation of complete orchard. Management strategy Current management strategies rely on insecticide sprays. Two sprays of any of the following insecticide combinations are recommended by the National Research Center for Litchi, Muzaffarpur: yy Triazophos 40% E.C (1.5 ml/L) + Thiacloprid 21.7% SC (0.5 ml/L) yy Thiacloprid 21.7% SC (0.5 ml/L) + Lambda Cyhalothrin 5% E.C (1.0 ml/L) Kusum tree 1. Litchi stink bug sucking sap from a soft twig, 2. Close-up view of bug on fruits, 3. Adult bug, 4-5. Bug infested panicles and fruits, and 6. Signs of damage on fruits due to feeding of bugs 1 4 2 5 3 6 January–February 2022 11 yy Thiacloprid 21.7% SC (0.5 ml/L) + Fipronil 5% SC (1.5 ml/L) yy Dimethoate 30% SC (1.5 ml/L) + Lambda Cyhalothrin 5% E.C (1.0 ml/L) yy Dimethoate 30% SC (1.5 ml/L) + Cypermethrin 5% E.C (1.0 ml/L) yy Combi-product [Triazophos (35%) + Deltamethrin (1%) EC] – 2.0 ml/L First spray should be done between 10th to 15th February and second spray between 25th to 28th February. Whenever an insecticidal spray is taken up, the fallen down insects on ground must be collected/ sweeped-off by a broom and destroyed manually by putting in a pit and covering with soils. Besides insecticidal spray, tree banding (putting sticky bands on tree trunk) may be done in the month of March-April after spraying of insecticides to prevent the nymphs to crawl up on trees. Use sticker in insecticide solution @ 0.4 ml/litre. Action plan for prevention In background of the threats explained, an action plan similar to managing ‘Covid-19’ pandemic is required for stink bug to save litchi orchards in Bihar and livelihood of litchi farmers. Like ‘mass vaccination’ against Covid-19, we need to have wide area management through ‘mass insecticidal spray’ or ‘community spay’ for all the orchards in the identified containment zone. We need to have an immediate action plan as well as a long-term strategy too for this pest. Immediate action plan includes quarantine and mass insecticidal spray as the pest needs to be quarantined in its current area of infestation by any means. This will involve continuous survey and surveillance in the current area of infestation and the adjoining areas as well, on a war-footing basis and containment zone may be declared. In this containment zone, immediate action plan will be to undertake two insecticidal sprays at 15 days interval in September- October i.e.
