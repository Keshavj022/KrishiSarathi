Microorganisms play a major role in keeping soils live through its ecosystem services like solubilization of minerals, recycling of organic matter, bioremediation and soil formation. Post green revolution, self sufficiency in food grain production was achieved through the use of high yielding varieties responsive to chemical fertilizers.
