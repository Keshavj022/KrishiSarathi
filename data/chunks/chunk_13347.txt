Maintaining Database of Trained Manpower Developing complete and comprehensive database of training details of all categories of employees provide a logical backup for assessing the training needs/gaps and help in planning present and future training programmes. Such a database also helps in effective manpower planning and their effective deployment in the organization. Keeping in view of the crucial importance of this activity, all the Directors of ICAR-Institutes were requested for entering information on training of all the categories of employees of the Institutes as well as Regional Stations. The training details of about 8000 employees of various categories (scientific, technical, administrative and SSS) have been updated in the ERP system of ICAR with the help of IASRI, New Delhi. 12. Resource Generation As per the ICAR HRM Policy : Training and Capacity Building, ICAR being the apex body of the National Agricultural Research and Education System (NARES) of the country has to play an important role in supporting the development of training capacity in the SAUs, Central Agricultural Universities (CAUs) and ICAR funded KVKs. Since SAUs, CAUs and ICAR funded KVKs are the integral part of NARES, therefore, they may be given opportunity to avail the expertise available with the ICAR system. The NARES including ICAR†is committed to solve the existing problems of Indian agriculture and enhancing agricultural production and productivity in the country through science-led and technology- driven farming systems approach. Therefore, it was felt appropriate to extend the training facility of ICAR to the employees of SAUs, CAUs and ICAR funded KVKs in various training programmes for enhancing their competency by charging a nominal fee without putting additional burden on the HRD fund of ICAR. By this way, approx. a sum of Rs 30.00 lakh was generated through participation of employees particularly from SAUs, CAUs, Central/ State Govt. and ICAR funded KVKs during 2017-18. 13. Introduction of Chapter on “Training and Capacity Building” As per the National Training Policy-2012 of Government of India, it is mandatory for each Ministries/Departments to include a chapter on ìTraining and Capacity Buildingî in their Annual Report. Keeping this in view, ICAR has been including a chapter on ìTraining and Capacity Buildingî in the Annual Reports of DARE/ICAR as well as ICAR-Institutes since 2016. This highlights the Training and Capacity Building initiatives and the importance attached with this activity by the Organization/Institution. 14.
