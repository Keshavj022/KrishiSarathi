 The infestation of insect prevailed in the root system which damaged the crop. The traditional system of insect control was followed by intercultural practices.

During the cropping season about 60000 lit of water was added for 60 times @ 3.0 lit water per pit in Site I and 35000 lit water in Site II in 35 times (Table 1.) at maturity stage for consumption as fruits. First stage was daily picking for 30 days in a month giving an average yield of 6.5 kg/day where as in middle period for 20 days it was 8.0 kg/day. At fruiting stage the average yield was 120 kg/day On an average 2-3 litres of waters was applied Table 6.

Data presented in Tables 2 and 3 indicate moisture content in different depths of soil profile in Site I and II, respectively. The observations were taken once a month in the months of May, June, July and August during 2002. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, moisture is very low, which increased generally with increase in soil depth.
