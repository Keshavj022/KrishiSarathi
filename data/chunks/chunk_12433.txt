It is surrounded by Uttar Pradesh (UP) on the east, Punjab on the west, Uttaranchal, Himachal Pradesh & Shivalik Hills on the north and Delhi, Rajasthan and Aravali Hills on the south. The altitude of Haryana varies between 700 ft to 900 ft above the sea level. An area of 1,553 sq km is covered by forests. The state has a total of 81 cities & towns and 6,759 villages. For administrative purpose, the state has been divided into four divisions (Ambala, Rohtak, Gurgaon and Hissar) and 22 districts. Situated in northwest, Haryana is one of the leading agriculture state of the country. It is also the most intensively cultivated (184 % cropping intensity) state. Farmers have continued to grow rice and wheat as dominant crops due to government incentives and market price ignoring the suitability of soil, climatic conditions and long term repercussions. The inappropriate land use and introduction of canal irrigation have resulted in soil degradation, soil erosion (8.5% by water and 12% by wind), salinity and alkalinity (9.7%) and water-logging (3.3%), besides nutrient losses as well as depletion of ground water at an alarming rate. The problems of salinity, sodicity and water-logging have been attributed to irrigation without providing drainage in the aeo-fluvial plains of semi-arid region of Haryana. Salinity and sodicity has been created in the highly intensive canal irrigation areas in the central and eastern part of the state. Water table is falling in the central east zone due to over exploitation of ground water where rice –wheat crop rotation is plasticized. It has gone down by of 6.0-7.5 m in a short span of 10 years and thus, has increased the cost of irrigation. Soil fertility has also been declined here due the constant growing of nutrients exhaustive rice and wheat crops. The above situations, thus, pose serious threats to sustainability of agriculture in this high productive zone of the state. The contribution of the State in the National Gross Domestic Product at constant (2011-12) prices has been estimated to be 3.5 percent as per. Based on ecology and cropping pattern, the state can be divided into three agro-eco regions. Zone I: constitutes nearly 32 per cent of total area of the State consists of eight districts, namely Panchkula, Ambala, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar, Karnal, Panipat and Sonepat. Zone II: consists of seven districts namely Sirsa, Fatehabad, Hisar, Jind, Rohtak, Faridabad and Palwal covering 39 per cent of total area of the State.
