The mean values of CO 2 in control animals of Groups II were 8.94 ± 0.36 kPa and 8.75 ± 0.23 kPa before and after treatment respectively. In the treated animals, they were 8.46 ± 0.37 kPa and 8.36 ± 0.22 kPa respectively (Table 5). There was no significant change in the pulse rate, respiration rate and level indicating that the treatment did not significantly effect any change in the new born calves. CONCLUSION There was no significant effect of the ITK on physiology of day-old calves as compared to the control. Normally in calves the levels of total protein, glucose, potassium, calcium and phosphorus are elevated at birth and they decline gradually to normal values. Total protein increased and glucose, potassium, calcium and phosphorus decreased from day 1 to day 10 in control and treatment groups but these were not significant indicating that the treatment had no effect on the day-old calves. Among physiological parameters in Groups- II, the pulse rate and respiration rate in the control animals were 99.5 ± 1.77 and 32.63 ± 0.81 before treatment and 97.63 ± 1.33 and 32 ± 0.77 after treatment respectively. In the animals treated with black pepper powder, the pulse rate and respiration rate were 101.25 ± 1.35 and 33.38 ± VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Code : 1275 Title of the ITK : Protection of animals from loo disease by using neem (Azardichta indica) Description of the ITK : To control loo (sun stroke) and other diseases in animal, 250 g neem oil is given orally to animal in the last week of March. This treatment costs Rs 45 per animals which is practised by farmers of Multanpur and its nearby villages of Uttar Pradesh Name and address of the discloser : Dr Niranjan Lal, Division of Extension Education, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Uttar Pradesh) 243 122. Location of use of the ITK : This ITK is used in many villages of Bareilly and Badaun districts Experimenters : Dr D. Swarup, Head and Dr Reena Mukherjee, Scientist (SS), Division of Medicine; Dr Mahesh Chander, Senior Scientist, Division of Extension Education, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Uttar Pradesh) 243 122 METHODOLOGY Location Field survey was done in villages of Bareilly district.
