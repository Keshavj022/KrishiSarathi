 The study area is 49 % crop land, 26 % barren land, 12 % reserved forest, and 9 % built-up area and 4 % waterbodies (Supplementary Fig. 1). The main food crops grown are maize, rice, jowar, bajra, plus horse gram, black M.R. Hari Raj et al. Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 229 (2025) 109932 4 gram, green gram, cotton cash crop, oilseed groundnut, and horticul­ tural crops are mango, banana, and guava, vegetables are tomatoes and chillies, and spices are coriander and onion (District Statistical Report 2022). The cultivation of rice (50.6 %), groundnuts (0.78 %), pulses (0.78 %), and sugarcane (5.33 %) are the main source of income in the region (District Survey Report 2016). 2.1.3. Hydrogeology The main aquifer system, consisting of gneissic formation, encom­ passes 90 % of the area. The charnockite occupies the other 10 % of the groundwater lithology. The water table level is approximately 6.32 m below the ground level in summer season and 3.56 m below the ground level in winter season (TWAD Board, 2024). The aquifer, has a typical thickness of between 15 and 40 m below ground level (bgl), is composed of weathered and fractured gneiss and charnockite. Bore wells and dug wells are the sources of groundwater supply. Bore wells are mostly up to 200 mbgl and dug wells up to 20 mbgl. Average discharge is 43–123 L per minute (lpm). Average transmissivity is 8–30 m2/day. Average water permeability is 1–1.3 m/day (CGWB Report, 2019; National Water Mission, 2013). Storativity (S) is from 3.41 × 10−5 to 0.7 × 10−2 pounds per square inch (psi−1). About 3 % of surface water sources, including lakes, ponds, and rivers, are connected to the groundwater system. 2.2. Collection and examination of data In total, 94 groundwater samples were collected for assessment of water quality from bore wells and dug wells. Groundwater samples were collected using a small stainless-steel bucket from open wells. A stainless-steel bucket was tied in a nylon rope of 30 m length. The bucket was lowered in the wells, and groundwater samples were collected by dipping the bucket few meters below the water level. Groundwater samples were collected by operating the submergible pumps fitted in the tube/bore wells. The field measurements were conducted with a trans­ portable Environmental and Scientific Instruments (ESICO and MODEL 1160E) to measure physical variables such as pH (accuracy: ±0.1pH unit), EC (accuracy: ±0.01 µS/cm), and TDS ((accuracy: ±1mg/l). To get rid of biological pollutants, each 1000 ml polyethylene container was washed with distilled water and concentrated HCL in a 1:1 ratio. Samples were collected in a cleaned container and then sealed airtight. Before laboratory studies, each container was geotagged and stored in a freezer at 4 ◦C.
