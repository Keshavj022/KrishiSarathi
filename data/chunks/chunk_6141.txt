 The treatments taken during the experiment of CRRI farm were: (i) use of parasi (75 kg/ha) at 30 days after transplanting (DAT), (ii) use of parasi (75 kg/ha) each at 30,60 and 90 DAT, (iii) use of parasi (100 kg/ha) at 30 DAT, (iv) use of parasi (100 kg/ ha) each at 30, 60 and 90 DAT, (v) use of parasi (150 kg/ha) at 30 DAT, (vi) use of parasi (150 kg/ ha) each at 30, 60 and 90 DAT, (vii) use of carbofuran (1 kg/ha) at 60 and 90 DAT, and (viii) untreated control. Seedlings of Savitri variety at 30 days were transplanted during third week of July in randomized block design by using 4 replications. Observations on dead-heart (DH) and white ear formation (WEH) were taken after Contents PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT Data obtained from the experiment in farmers' fields (Aralkocha) showed considerably less population of the insect in both the years, 2002 and 2003, ranging from 0 to 1/m2 with an average of 0.4/replication.White earhead formation was also meagre, ranging from 0 to 0.5. Reduction in population was related to the drought and heavy rain situation by the farmers. Yield varied from 5.63 to 6.03 tonnes/ha in comparison to 4.93 tonnes/ha in untreated control. Though the insect did not contribute to significant yield loss due to its less or no infestation, there was an increase in yield with parasi treatment in comparison to that with untreated control. Experiment conducted during rabi showed that among different treatments parasi leaf application (150 kg/ha) at 10 and 20 DAT and at 10,20 and 30 DAT were on par with the efficacy of carbofuran. Single application of parasi leaf at 150 kg/ha or 250 kg/ha were next in the order of efficacy, though all the treatments were superior to the untreated control. The same trend of efficacy was also obtained in white ear-head formation and grain yield. In addition to the reduction of YSB infestation, there was an increase in the number of ear-bearing tillers in all the treatments in comparison to the control. But it was more in repeated application of parasi treatments than in single application, which may also increase the grain yield (Table 3). CONCLUSION Parasi leaf was found effective in controlling yellow stem-borer and thereby increasing the yield of rice when it was applied thrice in rice fields. It has also been found effective in increasing the population of earthworms and soil bacteria. â–¡ Contents CROSS-SECTORAL VALIDATION OF INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN AGRICULTURE Codeno Title of the ITK Description of the ITK Name and address of the discloser Location of use of the ITK Experimenters 357 Control of insect-pests in lowland rice using parasi (Cleistanthus collinus) Approximately 0.4 to 0.5 kg fresh, tender branches of Cleistanthus collinus are planted erect or spread in the standing water after establishment of summer rice with the anticipation of pest outbreak.
