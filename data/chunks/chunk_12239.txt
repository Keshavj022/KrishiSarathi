It has high yield potential, better disease resistance, amenable to different sowing situations, has heat tolerance, high grain weight and appropriate industrial applications. These qualities will optimize investments and yield for maximum returns and would give maximum economic returns to farmers of the NWPZ, comprising Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan (except Kota and Udaipur divisions), western Uttar Pradesh (except Jhansi division), parts of Jammu and Kashmir (Kathua district), parts of Himachal Pradesh (Una district and Paonta Valley) and Uttarakhand (tarai region).
