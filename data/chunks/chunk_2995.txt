 ‘Sharad Bahar’ and 24 days in ‘Pin Gin’ whereas artificial light (16 h) provided to the plants for 2 weeks daily, delayed blooming by 28 days in ‘White Prolific’, 21 days in ‘Kundan’ and 14 days in ‘Flirt’ as compared to the control plants growing in natural day length conditions of Lucknow. • Citric acid (75 ppm) + AgNO3 (25 ppm) as best holding solution in chrysanthemum, BA (50 ppm) or sucrose (10 %) or Triadimefon (20 ppm) as best pulsing treatment of orchid flowers and 8‐ HQC (200 ppm) + sucrose (6 %) AgNO3 (25 ppm) + HQ (400 ppm) + sucrose (5%) as best holding solution for orchids. • Among the different fungicides tested against the leaf spot disease of chrysanthemum, Cuman (0.02%) and Dithane M 45 (0.02%) economically controlled the disease under Ludhiana conditions. www.icar.org.in 6 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Horticulture • Pune centre has recommended that six sprays of Chlorothalonil @ 0.02% or Mancozeb (0.02%) at 15 days interval starting from the first spray immediately at the disease appearance, were effective in controlling the leaf spot disease of chrysanthemum 4. ORCHIDS • The centres namely Vellanikkara, Yercaud, Kalyani, Bhubaneswar, Kahikuchi, Shillong, Kalimpong and UAS Bangalore collected and maintained 165 accessions of various genera, species and hybrids of orchids. • Cocunut husk was found as the best suitable medium for Dendrobium cv. ‘Sonia’ at Kalyani. • In Dendrobium orchid Sonia – 17, NPK 20:30:30, 10:30:30 or 10:20:20 at 0.2 % spraying twice weekly were recommended for commercial cultivation. • The foliar application of N:P:K (10:5:10) @ 0.2% and VAM applied near root zone at the time of planting resulted in best growth and flowering in Epidendrum radicans and Coelogyne species under Yercaud conditions. • BA 100 ppm and GA3 50 ppm in Dendrobium cv. Sonia 17 bring about good spike length. • 75 % shadenet for Dendrobium cv. Sonia‐17, 2 h extended light in chrysanthemum, and low‐cost polyhouse for Srinagar for gerbera growing are best. • 75 % shadenet for Dendrobium cv. Sonia‐17, 2 h extended light in chrysanthemum, and low‐cost polyhouse for Srinagar for gerbera growing are best. • Tile bits + coconut fibre for Dendrobium and river sand + leaf mould + cocopeat medium for anthurium are recommended for better growth and development. 4. ANTHURIUM • In anthurium, 206 varieties were collected, maintained and evaluated at Hessaraghatta Coimbatore, Yercaud, Kalimpong, Kahikuchi, Shillong, Kalyani and Vellanikkara. • Spadix explant of anthurium could successfully be established after surface sterilization with mercuric chloride (0.1%) for 10 min., culturing on MS medium supplemented with 2,4‐D (2 mg/l) and Kinetin(0.3 mg/l) was found optimum for obtaining orgarogenesis from the explant at Vellanikkara. • Top cuttings, nodal cuttings and suckers of anthurium can be propagated successfully on 100% cocopeat under Hessaraghatta like conditions.
