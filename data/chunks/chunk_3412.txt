Opinion of respondents towards training design and delivery Transfer outcomes A perusal of table 23 infers that the respondents agreed towards improvement in knowledge, skills, transfer of training information to peer group, improvement in research efficiency, organizational performance, preparation of teaching and training resource materials and guiding research scholars as an impact of CAFT training back at their work place. It could be understood from Fig. 11 that the average score of traineesâ€Ÿ attributes and training design and delivery ranges around 8-9, while organizational climate ranges between 7-8 in a ten-point scale of opinion. This implies that comparatively there is a need for improvement from the organizational climate to support application of knowledge, skills and attitude gained by the participants of CAFT programmes back at job environment. This may be the reason for their comparatively lesser average scores towards their perceived transfer outcomes.
