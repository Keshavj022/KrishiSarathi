 Malnutrition can result from inadequate intake of essential nutrients, poor absorption, or excessive loss of nutrients due to illness or disease. Dairy products can provide essential nutrients that are often lacking in the diets of malnourished individuals, especially in developing countries. For example, milk and milk products have been used to treat malnutrition in children with positive outcomes in countries like India. During climatic hazards and emergencies such as floods, droughts, or other natural disasters, access to food can be severely restricted, leading to malnutrition and other health problems. In such situations, dairying can play a crucial role in ensuring nutritional security and providing essential nutrients to the affected population. Milk and milk products can be an important source of nutrition during emergencies due to their high nutritional value and long shelf-life. Milk powder, for example, can be easily transported and stored for long periods, providing a reliable source of nutrition for affected populations. Additionally, dairy products such as cheese, yogurt, and butter can be made from milk and can provide essential nutrients in various forms. Furthermore, dairying can be an important source of income and livelihood during emergencies. Dairy animals such as cows, goats, and sheep can provide milk and other dairy products that can be sold or used for personal consumption. This can provide a source of income and help families to maintain their nutritional security during emergencies. Pathways for nutritional and food security in India through dairying In India, millions of poor people are supported by the dairy business, and for many, it is their only source of income, putting money in their hands twice a day throughout the year. In India, as in many other developing countries, the distribution of cattle among the poor is significantly more equitable than the allocation of land. Therefore, livestock play a crucial role in supporting and sustaining the livelihoods of a substantial number of poor individuals. As common property resources are increasingly appropriated for private gain, livestock is often the only subsistence option available to those without land. Rural dairy businesses in India are considered a “treasure” of the economy. There are numerous paths leading from dairying or animal keeping in general to the security of food and nutrition, both positive and negative. Dairy production directly affects household earnings, which raises the affordability of buying more food and a larger variety of foods. About 69% of India’s farming population considers dairying to be a secondary occupation. It generates almost one-third of the gross income of rural households and nearly half of the gross income of those without land, allowing people to get nutritious foods and ensuring food security.
