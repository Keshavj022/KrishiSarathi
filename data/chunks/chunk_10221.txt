 The dependency on imports has considerably reduced from 6.61 Mt in 2016 to 2.46 Mt in 2020. Several factors contributed to pulse revolution including R&D efforts for developing HYV and technologies, quality seed, extension and policy support. Amongst these, the most tangible effort is in developing/promoting a total of 716 HYVs (including 211 in chickpea, 145 in pigeonpea, 133 in mungbean, 67 in urdbean, and 46 in lentil) released so far with unique attributes and yield potentials to fit into various cropping systems/agro-ecosystem in the country. Indian Agriculture after Independence 80 3. Major achievements in various crops 3.1. Rice India is the second-largest rice-producing country with a share of 22% in the world after China. India has a production of official figures for 2020-21 is 124 Mt with average productivity of 2.7 t ha-1 of rice i.e., 4.1 t ha-1 paddy. While the rice area in the country remained almost the same (43-44 Mha) in the last seven and half decades, a steep increase in rice production has driven the country to a state of exportable surplus (Fig. 1). India has also become a major global exporter both for premium i.e., Basmati and general quality grades of rice while ensuring a steady supply of rice for more than 1.35 billion of people in the country. In the pre-independence era, rice cultivation was restricted to a single crop per year with low yield, and the cultivation was mostly done with photo- sensitive, lodging, disease, and pest susceptible traditional verities of very long duration (>180 days). During the Green Revolution era, with the discovery of the semi-dwarfing gene source sd1, there was a phenomenal hike in the genetic gain of rice. This semi-dwarf gene supported the green revolution ensuring the food security of the country. The first semi-dwarf high yielding variety developed was TN1 in Taiwan, which was followed by miracle variety ‘IR8’ developed by IRRI that transformed the fortunes of rice growers across the globe including India. During 1966 to 2021, a total of 1199 varieties including 127 hybrids of rice have been released and notified by Central Sub-Committee on Crop Standards, Notification, and Release of varieties. The 90s witnessed the development of rice hybrids using parental lines received from IRRI, Philippines and improved by several committed research groups in India and multi- location testing to validate their superiority over varietal checks in AICRIP. The hybrids showed superiority over inbred varieties by 10-15%. In the same decade, under AICRIP, non-basmati quality trials were also initiated with aromatic short grain rice varieties, targeting the export markets. Decoding of complete rice genome by International and Indian efforts in 2005 helped greatly in mapping and MAS for important traits (IRGSP 2005).
