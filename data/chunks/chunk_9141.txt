 Although, the Central Potato Research Institute (CPRI), Shimla, has come up in 1949 and the Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI), Thiruvananthapuram, in 1963. Research on coconut has been continuing since 1916 at Kasaragod, but the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI), Kasaragod, has come up only in 1970. The other institutes devoted to research on horticultural crops are: the Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (since 1984); ICAR Research Complex for Goa(since 1989); Central Institute of Temperate Horticulture (since 1994): and the Indian Institute of Spices Research, Calicut (since 1995). The Indian Institute of Spices Research started off as National Research Centre for Spices in 1985. On most horticultural crops (except potato, tuber crops, coconut, arecanut and some spices) systematic research is nearly two decades old. Regular bearing in mango — genetic and paclobutrazol-induced; high-density planting in mango, banana and pineapple; hardy rootstock in citrus; use of gibberellic acid to improve berry-size and quality of grape; commercialization of arid fruit crops ber, aonla and pomegranate; introduction and expansion of KINNOW mandarin in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh and standardization of softwood grafting in mango, cashew and sapota have led to marked improvements in production and productivity of the fruit crops. NEWER HYBRIDS OF MANGO... Dwarf, regular bearing, free-from-spongy-tissue hybrids of mango have been developed at the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), Bangalore. ARKA ARUNA (BANGANAPALLI x ALPHONSO). Suitable for high-density planting (400 plants/ha). Average fruit weight 400 g; TSS 20° Brix. Yield 20-24 tonnes/ha. ARKA PUNEET (ALPHONSO x BANGANAPALLI). Average fruit weight 225 g: flesh firm, good flavoured; pulp fibreless, deep orange in colour. Yield 10-12 tonnes/ha. ARKA ANMOL (ALPHONSO x JANARDHAN PASAND). Average fruit weight 300 g. Pulp fibreless; excellent sugar-acid blend. Yield 11-12 tonnes/ha. Mango ARKA ARUNA While several varieties have been identified in apple for commercial growing, many high-yielding varieties have been developed in mango (MALLIKA, AMRAPALI, ARKAANMOL, RATNA, SINDHU); banana (Co 1,H 1,H 2); grape (ARKAVATI, ARKA NEELMANI, TAS--GANESH, DILKUSH); citrus (PRAMALINI, VIKRAM, PKM 1 Mango ARKA PUNEET ONGOING BASIC RESEARCH ON MANGO... Though regular flowering has been induced at the IIHR, Bangalore, by spraying the trees five times with 200 ppm ethrel and 0.1% urea commencing mid- September, the trees become devitalized. Suitable alternatives are being looked for. Soil drenching of Paclobutrazol @ 5 g/tree promotes flowering and fruit-set during the off-years. Residual effect of the chemical in soil continues for 2-3 years and irregular bearing is offset; instead early and higher yields encouraged. Long-term effects of continued use of Paclobutrazol remain to be assessed.
