Good combiner and gives higher heterosis for yield and other desirable traits. Resistance is governed by single dominant gene, hence can be utilized for resistant hybrid development Marchâ€“April 2023 51 Cucurbitaceous crops Cucurbitaceae is among the important families providing large number of vegetables such as gourds, melons, pumpkin/squash and cucumbers. Among major crops, the cucurbits are important for the Indian region, including 38 endemic species. One example of unique germplasm in vegetable crops in India is the bitter gourd. The Indian variety of bitter gourd is known for its high tolerance to extreme weather conditions and its ability to produce fruits even in drought-like conditions. This makes it an important crop for farmers in arid regions of the country.
