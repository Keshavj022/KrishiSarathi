, 2023 used artificial neural network (ANN) models and Gradient Boosting Regres­ sion (GBR) for IWQI, with the ANN model demonstrating superior per­ formance compared to the GBR model. The coefficients of determination (R2 values) for both training and testing sets are 0.973 and 0.958, respectively. In this study area, previous studies were carried out on fluoride, perchlorate, and nitrate contamination in groundwater by (Karunanidhi et al., 2021a, karunanidhi et al., 2021b, Raj et al., 2025, Karunanidhi et al., 2024a, Karunanidhi et al., 2024b). There is no prior research study to incorporate an irrigation water quality index (IWQI) with a machine learning (SVM and KNN) algorithm. With this concern in mind, the main objectives of this study are proposed (1) to calculate SAR, Na%, PI, RSC, KR and MHR, parameters in the groundwater samples (2) to evaluate IWQI to train the models, (3) to develop SVM and KNN algorithm models, (4) to validate the models by means of statistical error values and precision, and (5) to find the best ML model to predict irrigation suitability based on irrigation water quality index in Arjunanadi River basin of south India. The results of this study will provide administrators with a comprehensive overview about incorporating modern technolo­ gies to enhance cost and time effective ways of managing, address groundwater quality issues, and develop innovative strategies for agri­ cultural practices. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area 2.1.1. Topography and climate The Arjunanadi River basin in Tamil Nadu, India is a drought-prone region. It lies between 9◦35′34.041″to 9◦31′20.115″ N and 77◦32′4.462″ to 77◦59′26.165″ E. It has an area of 1136.5 km2 in the districts of Madurai and Virudhunagar (Fig. 1). The highest elevation reaches 1266 m above mean sea level (MSL) in the western portion comprise of the Western Ghats, while the eastern area features a lowest elevation of around 25 m above MSL, indicating the presence of plains. The river flows in a northwest-to-southeast direction and joins the mainstream Vaippar near Sattur. The region experiences very hot and dry weather in the months of April to June, and in the months of December to January is a cold weather. The average annual temperature varies between 23.2 and 35.5◦C. The main source of rain is the northeast monsoon. It has an annual average rainfall of 956 mm, and the annual average evaporation rate ranges between 750–1500 mm (TWAD Board, 2024). 2.1.2. Geology and land use/land cover The study area covers most of the Archaean-Proterozoic Southern Granulite Terrain, Charnockite, Gneissic complex, Migmatite gneissic complex and smaller amount of Khondalite complex (GSI. 1995; GSI, 2018). The major types include charnockite and hornblende-biotite gneiss rocks. The three main types of soil are deep red loam, red sandy soil, and black soil (Geology and Mining Report, 2016).
