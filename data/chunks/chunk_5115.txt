 The mean value of total leucocyte count (Tlc) in apparently healthy cattle was 5,350.00 ą 38.88 per ml.The pretreatment means of total leucocyte count in foot-and- mouth disease-affected animals of treatment Groups I and II were 8,870 ą 66.12 and 8,820.00 ą 160.99 per ml respectively . The post- treatment mean values of total leucocyte count in sick animals of treatment Groups I and I I were 7,361.66 ą 99.70 and 5,670.00 ą 25.44 per ml respectively (Table 3). Analysis of variance showed that there was significant difference in mean total leucocyte count in pre-and post-treatment stages (P>0.01). However, there was no significant difference between treatment groups. The mean values of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils ofapparently healthy cattle were 1,703.23 ą 16.52, 3, 491.73 ą 24.49, 98.13 ą 6.75 and 76.87 ą 5.55 per ml respectively. Their pre-treatment mean values of sick animals in Group I were 4,001. 17 ą 36. 49 , 4,606. 47 ą 37.04 , 149.47 ą 9.73 and 115.90 ą 7.99 per ml respectively, and the post-treatment mean values of sick animals in Group-I were 3,084.17 ą 49.64, 4,160.82 ą 54. 95, 87.87 ą 7.77, 28.55 ą 6.52 per ml respectively , whereas there pre- treatment values of sick animals in Group II were 3,988.17 ą 77.48, 4,573. 40 ą 87.67 , 143.23 ą 9. 78 and 115. 83 ą 6. 81 per ml respectively . The post- treatment values of neutrophils , lymphocytes , monocytes and eosinophils decreased and there was an increase in lymphocyte count in both sick groups. Analysis of variance showed that there was a significant difference in mean neutrophils Table 3.

Sixty foot-and-mouth disease-affected animals were divided into two groups (Groups I and II) of 30 animals each. Group I was further divided into 3 subgroups A, B and C of 10 animals each.
