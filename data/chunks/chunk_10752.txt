   For the control of fruit spot/ rot problem spray Companian or Saaf @ 500 gm in 200 litres of water during second week of June   During first week of July spray Copper oxychloride 400 gm +Streptocycline 20 gm in 200 litres of water for the control of bacterial spot. Punjab Rice (Puddled rice)   Use high yielding and short duration of parmal rice like PR 131, PR 130, PR 113, PR 114, PR 121, PR 122, PR 123, PR 124, PR 126, PR 127, PR 129, HKR 47. Do not grow long duration varieties like Pusa 44, Peeli Pusa, HKR 127 as these varieties consume 15-20% more water and susceptible to most of the prevalent pathotypes of bacterial blight (demands at least 2 extra sprays of pesticides, thereby lowering the net profit).   Restrict to timely sowing of nursery (20 May-5 June) and timely transplanting (20 June-5 July) schedule for better grain quality, water saving and low build up of stem borers. For higher yield and better grain quality from PR 126 and PR 124, transplant 25-30 days old nursery.   Use laser land leveller for precise land levelling before puddling to enhance efficiency of water and other farm inputs. Apply fertilizers as per soil test. Omit phosphorus application in rice following wheat that received recommended dose of phosphatic fertilizer. Use nitrogen judiciously based on Leaf Colour Chart (LCC). Excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer encourages multiplication of insect pests and diseases hence should be avoided.   Continuous incorporation/retention of rice straw improves soil health and rice yield. Whenever, the soil organic carbon content come under high (as per soil test report) category or after 8 years, reduces urea by 20 kg per acre in rice.   To control Zinc deficiency, apply 60 kg of zinc sulphate heptahydrate (21%) or 40 kg zinc sulphate monohydrate (33%) per hectare at puddling in case previous crop in this field had shown the symptoms of zinc deficiency. Where the deficiency is noticed in the growing crop, apply this quantity of zinc sulphate as soon as possible. ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 10 Direct Seeded Rice (Unpuddled rice)   Farmers should adopt direct seeding of rice (DSR) as it has several benefits such as (1) 10-20% saving in irrigation water, (2) 10-12% higher ground water recharge, (3) saves labor during rice transplanting season, (4) less prone to infestation of diseases (e.g. sheath blight, foot rot), (5) provides 100 kg/acre higher yield of succeeding wheat as compared to conventional practice of puddled transplanted rice. Farmers need to adopt this technique only in medium to heavy textured soils. Its cultivation is not successful in light textured soils due to severe iron deficiency and lower crop yields.   Sowing should be done in the first fortnight of June and PR 126, PR 114, PR 121, PR 122, PR 127 are suitable varieties.
