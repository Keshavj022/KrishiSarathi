 So far the soil resource maps of 12 states and 2 union territories have been released. Thematic maps on various soil parameters for West Bengal, Gujarat and Pondicherry have also been brought out. = 22 =E~ India ===.

CROPPING SYSTEMS RESEARCH In our land of great diversity, the farmers grow a wide range of crops in Spatial and temporal arrangement depending on the natural resource endowments and socio-economic conditions. Cropping Systems Research has not only to focus increasingly on parameters affecting productivity of these diverse crops, but on year-round production as well without deteriorating the soil health. Suitable crop combinations have therefore to be developed for specific regions. OBJECTIVES @ Developing efficient and high-intensity cropping systems and compatible agrotechniques suited to different agro-ecological regions across the country @ Understanding crop-weather relationships that serve as a basis for preparing crop-weather production models and for disease and pest forecasting @ Diversification of cropping systems by inclusion of high-value crops for higher returns @ Promoting farming systems approach for enhancing biomass production and increasing income and employment while ensuring minimum risk in rainfed agriculture SE As Se. ACHIEVEMENTS \ eae Physics Laboratory, CRIDA Physiology Laboratory, CRIDA GIS Laboratory, CRIDA Cropping systems research has resulted in the development of sustainable multiple cropping systems —rice-rice; rice-wheat-greengram, pear|millet-wheat — capable of producing 10-12 tonnes to a hectare a year from irrigated areas. : Pe BP ies The multipurpose gooseberry (Emblica officinalis) Sorghum-pigeonpea are recommended as has been identified for regions experiencing spatial _intercrops and temporal variability in rainfall and soil resource The neem tree, known for its biopesticide value, has been proposed for growing interspersed in arable crops . .. DRYLANDS CONSTITUTE TWO-THIRDS THE ARABLE LAND Though the rainfed arable land is two-thirds at present, food produced from itis 40%. Predominantly cultivated in the rainfed or drylands (largely Alfisols), are coarse cereals (91%), pulses (91%), oilseeds (80%) and cotton (65%).
