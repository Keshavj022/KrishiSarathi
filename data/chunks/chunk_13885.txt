 The dataset compared the levels of six DAP metabolites between an exposed and a control group, with signiﬁcance set at 0.05. All metabo- lite levels were signiﬁcantly higher in the exposed group: DEP at 23.87 ±1.67, DETP at 2.05 ±0.33, D. Kumar, S.N. Sinha and K.

The ’n’ value indicates the number of pesticides observed. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classiﬁcation system, pesticides are classiﬁed based on their tox- icity as follows: extremely hazardous (class Ia), Highly hazardous (class Ib), moderately hazardous (class II), slightly hazardous (class III), unlikely to present any hazard (class U) and unclassiﬁed (class O). DEDTP at 1.49 ±0.25, DMP at 6.47 ±1.46, DMTP at 20.09 ±1.13, DMDTP at 7.22 ±0.06, DEP at 33.70 ±0.75, DMP at 27.41 ±1.07, and DAP at 61.18 ±0.91. In contrast, the values in the control group were lower: DEP at 13.56 ±0.58, DETP at 1.18 ±0.21, DEDTP at 0.74 ±0.06, DMP at 3.21 ±1.07, DMTP at 10.54 ±1.00, DMDTP at 4.10 ±0.36, DEP at 17.19 ±0.29, DMP at 15.12 ±0.81, and DAP at 23.41 ±0.55. In addition, AChE enzyme levels were measured in U/mL: the exposed group had an average of 23.12 ±3.06 U/mL, while the average of the control group was higher at 28.
