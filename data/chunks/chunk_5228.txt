 The interpretation of the values after comparing these with analytical results of the final food item after cooking showed little effect on the levels of different constituents of the food item (Table 4). It is evident that the nutritive status of the traditional food item bhaley, which included besides others, the local herbs, added value to the nutrients as compared to the values when herbs were not mixed with bhaley (Table 5.) A comparison of the analytical results obtained revealed that the local herbs affected the nutritive status of the food item in the following manner. 1. The protein content of bhaley was 13.8% without addition of herbs, whereas it increased to 27.8% by addition of bhabri and jhau. 2. Crude fibre level in the finished product was also greatly influenced by these local herbs (3.2% from 0.8%). 3. Marked improvement in the vitamin content was also obtained by a ddition of these herbs, i.e. vitamin C from 2.00% to 6.00%, vitamin B1 from 0.21 to 0.36%, and vitamin B 2 from 0.10% to 0.28%.

An analysis of the fatty acid profile of the final product (Table 6) shows that linoleic acid (54.1%), oleic acid (22.6%), palmitic acid (11.5%), linolenic acid (6.8%), stearic acid (4.1%) and lauric acid and myristic acid (0.5% each) added to nutritive value of bhaley with addition of herbs. Thus the values related to protein, ash, fibre content and all vitamins also were greatly influenced by the addition of these plant materials even in very low concentrations. Crude fibre level was affected the most, showing an increase of 3.2% from 0.80%. Similarly, there was 100% increase in protein and vitamin B 2 contents.
