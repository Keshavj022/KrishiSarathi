Mooventhan*, L. K. Verma, Uttam Singh, P. K. Ghosh and K. K. Mondal ICAR-National Institute of Biotic Stress Management, Raipur, Chhattisgarh 493 225 The Village Hatchery Unit (VHU) model is a sustainable approach to poultry farming developed under the Farmer FIRST Programme. It addresses the challenge of limited access to healthy chicks for small-scale and backyard farmers by providing village-based hatchery solutions. These VHUs empower local farmers and womenâ€™s self-help groups to hatch chicks at the community level, thereby reducing reliance on industrial hatcheries. VHUs foster self-sufficiency and support local economies, promoting sustainable practices in rural poultry farming. The model leverages automated incubators, proper hatchery management, and community-driven initiatives, ensuring the timely availability of quality chicks and enhancing local poultry production. This sustainable model is a practical and profitable solution, encouraging ecological balance, economic viability, and social equity in rural poultry farming. Keywords: Community-based, Farmer FIRST, Poultry, Rural, Small-scale, Sustainable, Village hatchery unit S USTAINABLE poultry farming approach prioritizes long-term ecological balance, economic viability, and social equity. The poultry business is heavily dependent on the availability of healthy chicks. However, non-availability of healthy chicks on time significantly impacts farming, particularly for small-scale farmers who rear backyard poultry and country breeds. Most industrial hatcheries prioritize supplying chicks to commercial farmers for large-scale operations, leaving small-scale and backyard farmers at a disadvantage. To overcome this issue, small-scale Village Hatchery Units (VHUs) are extremely beneficial. These units help ensure that healthy chicks are available at the village level on time. VHUs empower local farmers by providing them with the resources and knowledge to hatch their own chicks, reducing their reliance on industrial hatcheries and enhancing the sustainability of small-scale poultry farming. Most Kadaknath, duck, quail, and desi chicken farmers depend on chicks from outside sources, which comes with several issues such as high mortality rates, high cost of chicks and unreliable supply.
