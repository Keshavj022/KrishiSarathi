 Till date, activities undertaken are strengthening key digital infrastructures of the ICAR-AU system, such as the establishment of virtual classrooms at 18 AUs and effective implementation of the Agri-DIKSHA web channel, which has more than 20,000 e-contents developed and uploaded by partner AUs, the establishment of AR/VR labs at 10 partner AUs, the launch of KVC-Alnet and facilitate the AUs for ensuring the alum registration (so far more than 43,000 alumni have been registered on the portal), etc. are some of the key initiatives undertaken by Component-2 of the project. The major activities and achievements under the Monitoring and Learning component include Process Evaluation and Dipstick Surveys such as assessing the Graduate Income Index of 1-year graduate student, assessment of the measurable intermediate outcomes through mid-line survey specifically on facilitative units, development and implementation of AU Implementation Performance Scoreboard (AUIPS), satisfaction mapping of direct project beneficiaries, organizing M&E visits to select AUs, etc. In addition, PIU has also taken various initiatives to enhance the learning outcomes, such as Waste to Wealth and linking entrepreneurship, Clean and Green Awards, KRITAGYA AgTech Hackathon, Promoting Resilient Agricultural Education System (RAES), and Strategic study to assess the requirement of human resources in agriculture and allied fields for next 20 years, etc. The infrastructure developed, teaching, learning and skill upgradation initiatives under NAHEP are very much aligned with the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 formulated by the Government of India.
