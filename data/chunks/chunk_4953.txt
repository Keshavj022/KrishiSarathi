 Soil moisture was determined in tree basins at different depths after 3 days of rainfall, i.e. on 3 January 2003. The potential evaporation during this period was 1.1 mm/d. Subsequently, soil-moisture content under different moisture conservation treatments were determined on 13 and 21 April 2003. A 36 mm rain was received Fig. 3. Pine-needle mulch Fig. 4.

RAIN WATER MANAGEMENT shaping had significant effect on soil-moisture conservation. Soil moisture in all soil layers and at all dates was significantly higher in plant basins treated with terracing and trenching. Trenching enhanced water conservation through harvesting of runoff water, and utilizing water directly from the rains and snow. Terracing alone was also effective in conserving moisture by directing the flow of run-off towards plant basins. Effect of mulching The effect of mulching on soil moisture conservation is shown in Table. 4. The positive effect of mulching on soil moisture conservation is well known. Mulching retained more soil moisture than no-mulch control. Differences in moisture conservation due to different types of mulches, however, were small, but in many cases significant. Pine needle mulch had an edge over other mulch materials. The choice of mulch Fig. 10. Silpauline-lined tank Fig. 12. RCC tank material will depend on its availability, cost effectiveness and moisture conservation in the long run. Pine needles are easily available locally.
