 These advanced sensors, equipped with cutting- edge capabilities and integrated with modern technologies, offer a wide range of beneﬁts that contribute to more sus- tainable, efﬁcient, and resilient agricultural practices. Smart sensors deliver high-resolution, real-time data on key param- eters like soil moisture, nutrient levels, crop health, and environmental conditions. This abundance of data enables farmers to make decisions guided by information and cus- tomize their actions to precisely match the crop require- ments. By relying on precise and timely data, farmers can optimize their resource use, minimize waste, and boost overall productivity. The concept of precision agriculture revolves around treating each part of the ﬁeld individually, acknowl- edging that different areas have distinct needs. Smart sensors facilitate precision farming by offering detailed insights into spatial variations in soil and crop conditions [6]. This enables the targeted application of fertilizers, pesticides, and water, minimizing excess usage and ensuring that inputs are applied where and when they are most needed. With a growing global population and limited natural resources, the efﬁcient use of resources is imperative. Smart sensors play a critical role in promoting resource efﬁciency by enabling precise irrigation scheduling, optimizing nutrient application, and monitoring environmental conditions to prevent wasteful practices. By conserving water, fertilizers, and energy, smart sensor tech- nologies contribute to sustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture. Smart sensors for crop health monitoring have the capability to identify initial indications of diseases, pests, and stress factors. This permits prompt actions to be taken. Rapid detection and response to potential threats help prevent the spread of diseases and minimize yield losses. This proactive approach improves overall crop health and reduces the dependence on chemical treatments. As climate change continues to pose challenges to agricultural productivity, smart sensors assist in building climate resilience. By moni- toring weather conditions, soil moisture levels, and other environmental parameters, farmers can adapt their practices to changing climate patterns. This adaptability enhances the sector’s ability to withstand extreme weather events and ensures continuity in food production. Smart sensors generate vast amounts of data, which, when coupled with data analytics and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), offer valuable insights into crop performance and farm management. These analytics enable trend analysis, predictive modeling, and actionable recom- mendations that optimize agricultural practices and increase proﬁtability. Progress in smart sensor technology has resulted in the creation of sensor solutions that are both cost-effective and easy for users to operate.
