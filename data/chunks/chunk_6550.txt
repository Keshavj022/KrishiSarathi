 The thematic areas were nutrition management; animal disease management; livestock production management; feed and fodder management; evaluation of breeds; fish production; processing and value addition; small scale income generation and composite fish culture. Nutrition management (271 technologies assessed through 1,755 trials at 687 locations) and disease management (190 technologies assessed through 1,229 trials at 631 locations) were the major thematic areas. Farm and non-farm enterprises: KVKs could test 657 technologies under farm and non-farm enterprises at 2,493 locations through 4,685 trials. Technologies belonged to major thematic areas such as processing and value addition; mechanization; resource conservation technology; organic farming; entrepreneurship development; mushroom cultivation; drudgery reduction; small-scale income generation; storage techniques; health and nutrition and post- harvest management. Processing and value addition (120 technologies assessed at 241 locations through 708 trials), health and nutrition (73 technologies assessed at 222 locations through 620 trials), mechanization (68 technologies assessed at 1,325 locations through 327 trials) and drudgery reduction (51 technologies assessed at 140 locations through 428 trials) were the dominant thematic areas chosen by the KVKs for assessment. Women empowerment: As part of technology assessment, 339 technologies pertaining to farm women ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 167 were assessed through 3,066 trials at 1,344 locations. Value addition (143 technologies, 999 trials at 363 locations) and health and nutrition (70 technologies assessed through 875 trials at 240 locations) were the major thematic areas of technologies assessed with an aim to promote women empowerment. Frontline Demonstrations Cluster Frontline Demonstration Division of Agriculture Extension, ICAR, New Delhi implemented Cluster Frontline Demonstrations (CFLDs) programme through KVKs on major pulse and oilseed crops under National Food Security Mission (NFSM) of Department of Agriculture & Farmersâ€™ Welfare, Government of India, New Delhi to demonstrate the production potential of different technologies of these crops. The CFLDs on pulses were executed on chickpea, pigeonpea, lentil, blackgram and greengram and those on oilseed crops were executed on sesame, groundnut, linseed, soybean, mustard, sunflower in pulse and oilseed growing states, viz. Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Cluster Frontline Demonstration on Pulses: During the period under report, 31,515.46 ha area was covered under 72,807 demonstrations on pulse crops across the country. In kharif 12,811.79 ha area (30,912 demonstrations) was covered, while in rabi 14,854.27 ha (32,612 demonstrations) and in summer season 3,849.40 ha (9,283 demonstrations) area was covered. At national level, the average yield advantage in pulse crops was 35.
