96 BC ratio) in cumin. Standardization of drip irrigation interval and method of micro-nutrient fertigation in fenugreek: Drip irrigation at four-day interval along with fertigation of all micronutrients is recommended for higher yield and higher economic returns from fenugreek. The water use efficiency of 7.93 and 8.98 kg/ ha-1mm-1 were obtained at 4 days interval drip irrigation at Jobner and Ajmer, respectively. Evaluation of natural farming (NF) practices: Under the aegis of All India Network Programme on Organic Farming (AINP-OF), with ICAR-IIFSR as the lead centre, ICAR-CTCRI conducted a field experiment with nine treatments replicated thrice in RBD. The net income was the highest in NF-4, natural farming without whapasa ( 812234/ha). The B:C ratio was highest in NF-1, natural farming without beejamrit, Cluster heat map of the shared (a) phyla among the treatments [C: Control, Z1- 50; Z2- 200; Z3-500; Z4-1000 mg Zn kg -1 as nano ZnO; Z5-50, Z6-200, Z7-500, Z8-1000 mg Zn kg -1 as bulk ZnO] Vegetable cowpea (var.

Long term experimentation is required for conclusive results and confirmation. Organic nutrient management practices for Sarpagandha developed: Based on three consecutive years study, it was found that application of FYM (20 t/ha) recorded maximum primary root yield (10.40 q/ha), reserpine yield (78.95 kg/ha), net return ( 3,62,000/ha) and B:C (3.56) in Sarpagandha. Crop Protection Ceratocystis fimbriata specific primers developed: Mango wilt disease caused by the fungus, Ceratocystis fimbriata has become a great constraint in most of the major mango growing regions of the country. Early detection of the pathogen in orchards is necessary for wilt management. ITS1 and ITS4 primers were used for specific detection in two isolates, CF-1 (583 bp) and CF-4 (611 bp). The sequences thus obtained were aligned using C. fimbriata CISH isolate (MF062274.1) and C. fimbriata isolates from other host plants like pomegranate, loquat, coffee, apple, and fifteen Ceratocystis spp. through ClustalW tool. Sequence variations were observed among the three isolates and the conserved regions were useful in designing specific primers. C. fimbriatomima, C. manginecans and C. eucalypticola were found more than 90% similar to the C. fimbriata isolates infecting mango and other host plants. Other than these three species, all other species were significantly distinct from C. fimbriata. Primer sequences which were unique to C. fimbriata were identified and produced the specific amplification of ~470 bp and ~350 bp, respectively in case of C. fimbriata DNA and absent in all other fungal DNA as well as negative control. This method is able to detect C.
