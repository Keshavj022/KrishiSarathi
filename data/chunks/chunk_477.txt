Direct seeding is either done manually or through seed cum-fertilizer drill machine in shallow furrows of 3-5 cm depth @ 25-30 kg/ha. For good crop stand, recommended row spacing is 20 cm apart. It is advisable to go for light irrigation just after sowing to ensure proper germination. Progressive application of pre-emergence herbicide Pendimethalin 30EC @ 1.5 kg/a.i./ha within 1-2 days of sowing followed by Bispyribac sodium 10% SC @ 20 g a.i./ha at 3-4 leaf stage of weeds between 15-20 DAS is advisable for proper weed control. If required, one or two hand/ mechanical weeding at 40 DAS and 60 DAS may be done. Inter- cultivation operation may be carried out when needed for effective weed management.
