 During the current year (2018-19), 35 employees (32 ICAR + 3 Non-ICAR) of such category staff of 31 ICAR-Institutes have participated in the said training programme commenced from 14 September, 2018. 7.3.8 New Training Programme for Regular Drivers (Tech. Gr.) Training programme for regular Drivers in Technical grades in ICAR was not existing and even it was never thought earlier to have a proper training programme for this group of employees. Besides, automobile maintenance has been identified as one of the important training need area for this category of staff. Further, they are not well versed with the latest skill for automobile maintenance, road safety as well as other related soft skills. Most of the employees in this category did not undergo any suitable training after their joining the ICAR services. Keeping this in mind, for the first time a new training programme ìAutomobile Maintenance, Road Safety and Behavioural Skillsî was designed, developed and organized by CIAE, Bhopal during 2016-18 (Table 4). So far total 153 regular Drivers undergone training in 06 Batches, out of which 90% Drivers got first time opportunity after joining ICAR service. Such programmes have been appreciated by DoPT. The Drivers were so happy that they collectively facilitated the Director, CIAE and others who were associated with the organization of the programme. Table 4.

Thirty five Technical staff from ICAR Institutes and 01 from SAU were trained, out of which 89% attended first time after joining services (Table 5). Table 5.
