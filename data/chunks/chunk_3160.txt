/ha or pre‐emergence application of alachlor @ 1.25 kg a.i./ha is equally effective under irrigation. www.icar.org.in 24 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science E. Important insect pests of castor and their management Insect Nature of damage Period of activity Cultural management Chemical control Red hairy caterpillar (Amsacta albistriga Wlk.) Larvae defoliate the crop. Major damage is caused by migrating caterpillars. More destruction to young crop. Active during June to August. Setting of light traps on community basis with the first monsoon rains to attract the moths and kill them, sowing cucumber along with castor. Placing the twigs of Ipomoea, Jatropha or Calotropis to attract the migrating caterpillars & kill them mechanically, opening deep furrows around field area and dusting methyl parathion/ quinalphos/endosulfan Spray of monocrotophos (0.05%) fenvalerate (0.02%), quinalphos (0.05%), or methyl parathion (0.05%). Semi‐ looper (Achoea janata L.) Damages crop by defoliation. Older larvae are voracious feeders and leave bare stems and veins. July to September Hand picking of older larvae during early stages of crop growth, avoid chemical spray when 1‐2 larval parasitoids (Microplitis sp.) are observed per plant. Spray monocrotophos (0.05%) or endosulphan (0.07%), if more than 25% defoliation is observed. Tobacco caterpillar (Spodopte ra litura F.) Damage is mostly by defoliation. Active during August to October. Collect and destroy egg masses and gregarious stages of the larvae along with damaged leaves. Spray chlorpyrifos (0.05%) or monocrotophos (0.05%) if defoliation is above 25% Hairy caterpillar (Euproctis sp. Spilo‐ soma obl‐ iqua Wlk.) Damage is mostly by defoliation, often capsules get damaged. Active during October to December. Collect & destroy egg masses and gregarious stages of the larvae along with damaged leaves. Spray chlorpyrifos (0.05%) or monocrotophos(0.05%) if defolition is exceeding 25% Capsule borer (Cono‐ gethes (Dicho‐ crosis) punctiferal is Guenee) Larvae bore the capsules & chara‐cteristic webbing of capsules along with excreta is seen. Infestation starts from flowering stage. Usually active during Nov. to March Good agronomic management with no or less use of insecticides on the crop usually keeps the borer at low level. Spray monocrotophos (0.05%) or endosulfan (0.07%) or dust the spikes with quinalphos (1.5%) or methyl parathion (2%) if at least 10% capsules are damaged. If the damage is severe, spray delta methrin (0.03%) or acephate (0.075%). Repeat the spray after 2‐3 weeks if required. Leaf hopper (Empoasca flavescens Distant) Both nymphs and adults suck sap from plants. Hopper burn symptoms are noticed if Jassid infestation is severe. Peak infestation is during November to January. Growing double/ triple bloom genotypes like GCH‐4, DCS‐9, GCH‐5, 48‐1, DCH‐32 etc. which usually do not express damage symptoms. Spray monocrotophos (0.05%) or dimethoate (0.05%).
