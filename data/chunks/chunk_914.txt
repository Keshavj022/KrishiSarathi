 The presence of higher amount of folic acid also helps in increasing the blood hemoglobin level in human beings. The grains are gluten free and act as a good food supplement among the patients suffering from celiac disease. Amaranth is thus an ideal crop having better nutritional properties and endowed with C4 metabolism suited to survive and thrive in an environment affected by climate change. The protein in amaranth seeds being of high quality, AMA-1 gene has been isolated from this crop and is being introduced into other important food crops like rice and potato. In potato, the product with higher yield and protein content has been found to be safe. The product has cleared tests related to toxicity and other side effects. The leaves are also rich in protein and are extremely useful from the human nutrition viewpoint. Uses • Amaranth's tender leaves are used as vegetable. • The grains are used in various culinary preparations. Popped grains are used in the form of pudding or are mixed with sugar syrup to make sweet balls (laddoo) and for making candy. The grains can be used in the preparation of breads, biscuits, flakes, cake, pastry, crackers, ice-cream and lysine rich baby foods. • Amaranth oil containing squalene, a cosmetic ingredient and skin penetrate, is also used as a lubricant for computer discs. • The tribal people use its grains for the treatment of measles and snakebites as well as for foot and mouth diseases of animals. The stem and leaf extracts are used in the treatment of kidney stones. Varietal development Research on grain amaranth is undertaken through All India Coordinated Research Network (AICRN) on Potential Crops (formerly Under Utilized crops) and more than 1000 germplasm accessions have been evaluated at multi-locations since the inception of the program. Out of these accessions, 25 varieties have been developed and released for both hill and plain region through selection. The details of the varieties and year of release are given in Table 1.
