5% Zinc sulphate has been recommended during October & November months for uniform flowering andfruiting every year.   Mango harvesting All the fruits harvested with pedicel avoiding injury to thefruits. Avoid shaking and injuries to branches and thus no loss by way of fruit drop from trees during harvesting.   Mango nutrient Apply 100g each of NPK per one-year-old plant (217g Urea + 625g SSP + 167g MOP). Increase 100g each of NPK every year up to 10 years. For 10 years and above old plantationapply 2.17 kg Urea + 6.25 kg SSP + 1.67 kg MOP per tree. 12. Livestock During Extreme Summer   During extreme summer wallowing arrangement should be made in the farm itself.   On large commercial dairy farms various cooling devices viz. fans, wet curtain or panels, air cooler or conditioners etc. can be used during extreme hot condition.   Provision of cooled potable drinking water reduces heat load during extreme summers ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 62   Shaded water troughs in sufficient numbers should be provided to the animals at convenient place.   Concentrate mixture containing more than 18% Digestible protein and 70% Energy contents along with palatable, digestible and laxative fodder should be offered to the animals   Proportion of green fodder should be increased and Long fodders must be chopped before feeding Soaking of concentrate in equal amount water for 20-30 minutes will increase nutrient utilization   Dietary mineral and vitamin supplementation should be increased during summer   Supplementing dietary sodium and potassium increases milk yield during the period of heat stress During Mansoon   Always try to keep the roof of animal sheds leak-proof as well as clean.   Livestock farmers must chop some of the young grass of rainy season & before feeding, dry it up in sunlight. It will soak water from the grass and will turn it into a good feed.   De-worming should be done in the beginning of the monsoon season and throughout the season as worms develop at a greater rate during this period.   Livestock farmers must spray their animals frequently for removal of ectoparasites & cut all bushes near their sheds.   Farm must be disinfected using a disinfectant regularly.   Make sure you have kept or stored the feeds in a dry place. 13. Goat Husbandry   Avoid any 'rhododendron’ type plants which may cause different kinds of sick conditions and finally results in death. If your goats consume these types of plants, you must seek immediate veterinary care.   Goats are highly susceptible to external & internal parasites, they must be de-wormed frequently. If the goats are not de-wormed frequently, it may result in weight-loss, reproductive failures, poor hair coat, and health problems. Farmers should make sure the goats herd is de-wormed at least once 2 to 3 months. Young goat kids should be given deworming medicine at the age of 7 to 8 weeks.
