 The major challenge for Indian jute breeders was to develop varieties suitable for new areas having wider adaptation. After 1947, research on jute were carried out initially at Rice Research Station, Chinsurah, Hooghly of West Bengal from 1948-52. The Jute Agricultural Research Institute came into existence at Barrackpore, West Bengal during 1953 and was renamed as Central Research Institute for Jute and Allied Fibres in 1990. The concerted breeding efforts in post-independent India resulted in the development of 47 varieties of jute. The release and commercial cultivation of jute variety JRO 524 in 1977, converted the existing white jute area to tossa jute area. TJ 40 released in 1983, was the first commercial tossa jute variety developed through mutation breeding approach. Another milestone in 2004 was the development of MT 150 the first kenaf variety suitable for paper pulp. JRO 204, a high yielding tossa jute variety with premature flowering resistance and better fibre quality was released in 2007. JRO 524 and JRO 204 occupy more than 70 percent of the jute area of the country. Scientists from ICAR- CRIJAF in collaboration with ICAR-National Institute for Plant Biotechnology (NIPB) successfully accomplished whole-genome sequencing of Corchorus olitorious cv. JRO-524 (Navin) with a draft genome of 377.3 Mbp, which is a popular Indian tossa jute variety (Sarkar et al. 2017). This will pave the way to develop innovative varieties of jute using gene and molecular marker technology. Table 9. Milestones in jute improvement Year Milestone 1948 Jute research in India started at Rice Research Station, Chinsurah, West Bengal. 1953 Jute Agricultural Research Institute came into existence at Barrackpore, West Bengal. 1954 First jute varieties JRC 212, JRC 321 and JRO 632 were developed. 1977 Development of tossa jute (Corchorus olitorius) variety JRO 524 (Navin), which is cultivated across India and replaced 90% capsularis jute because of high yield and shorter duration (120 days) and premature flowing resistance. 2007 Development of high yielding variety of olitorius jute JRO 204 (Suren), which replaced JRO 524. 2017 Whole Genome Sequencing of a leading Indian tossa Jute Variety JRO 524. 3.10. Fodder crops The major cultivated fodder crops in India are sorghum, maize, bajra, cowpea in kharif season, and oats, lucerne, berseem in rabi season. Among the perennial crops Bajra-Napier Achievements in Field Crops in Independent India 105 hybrid, Guinea grass, perennial lucerne, perennial sorghum, Stylosanthes, Desmenthus are popular in different parts of the country. Twenty major fodder crops are cultivated in around 9.0 million ha which has almost remained static for the last 3-4 decades. An additional 48 m ha of wastelands and degraded soils, 12 Mha pasture lands have the potential to be used for increasing forage resources.
