 In these centres, training is imparted through work experience, lectures, field visits, demonstration and discussions. During the year, 188 training courses were organized benefiting 2,893 participants and two more TTCs in the areas of vegetables and citrus have been sanctioned. SEED/PLANTING MATERIAL The KVKs produced 2816.2 tonnes of seeds of cereal crops, 264.8 tonnes of oilseeds, 563.9 tonnes of pulses and 160.3 tonnes of vegetables. In addition, 0.59 million fruit saplings, 11.32 million vegetable seedlings, 0.085 million spices seedlings, and 0.617 million seedlings of forest species, ornamental and other plantation crops were produced. A total of 669.2 tonnes of sugarcane sets, 29.8 bottles of mushroom spawn and 39,123 fodder crops were also produced. TECHNOLOGY EVALUATION AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT PROJECT The Division jointly with the Division of Crop Sciences has been implementing an All India Co-ordinated Crop Improvement Project for multi-locational trials across various crop production ecologies in different parts of the country to identify superior-yielding varieties. The yield data revealed that wheat variety PBW 343 (5.717 tonnes/ha) and UP 2556 (5.717 tonnes/ha) recorded the highest yield at KVK, Patiala (Punjab) closely followed by CBW 14 (5.614 tonnes/ha) and PBW 502 (5.608 tonnes/ha). Another trial was conducted to identify the high-yielding genotype of durum wheat with broader adaptability in Faridabad, Haryana, the variety PBW 283 recorded highest yield. At Faridabad, the wheat variety PBW 502 recorded the highest yield of 5.863 tonnes/ ha followed by variety PBW 492 (5.84 tonnes/ha). In another trial of pigeonpea, the variety V 30 gave 1.20 tonnes/ha and V 31 gave 1.14 tonnes/ha. l TTCs organized 188 training courses benefiting 2,893 participants. Two more TTCs sanctioned in the areas of vegetables and citrus.
