 However, co-expression pattern was not identified in CSR10 @ 18 dsm-1 and in contrast trehalase gene was differentially expressed in salt stress. Differential co-expression of trehalose biosynthesis genes could be one of the major mechanisms for hypersalinity tolerance in Urochondra and Dicanthium. Next, dehydrin gene from Urochondra was cloned in pCAMBIA1304 binary vector and transformed in CSR10. Molecular mapping and identification of candidate genes for anthracnose fruit rot disease resistance in chilli (Capsicum annuum L.): A total of 357 F2 segregating populations along with contrast parents were genotyped. Based on GBS analysis, aligned with Capsicum baccatum_CM008444.1 and Capsicum baccatum_ PBC81, whole genome sequence data, 8644 SNP markers were identified and consensus linkage map was developed. The distribution of SNPs observed across the 12 chromosomes. The SNPs located on Chr2 and 6 were validated in F2 and F2:3 phenotyped populations using the SSR primers designed specific to the regions where SNPs are present. The candidate genes (2 each located on Chr 2 & 6) linked to anthracnose fruit rot resistance were identified. Through GWAS, two major genomic regions were identified which are located on chr2 and chr6 as candidate resistance loci associated with anthracnose fruit rot in chilli. A total of 19 SNPs (QTNs; Quantitative Trait Nucleotides) were found to be significantly associated with fruit rot resistance (at â€“log10 (p) value >2.82 for % lesion area), of which five SNPs were located on chr2 (physically positioned at 12666827bp to 141379584bp) and seven SNPs were located on chr6 (physically positioned at 247161384bp to 252255814). Resistance related genes within the candidate genomic regions on chr2 (major locus) were searched on pepper pangenome, which revealed a cluster of nucleotide biding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domain involved in disease resistance in plants. The identified SNPs associated with candidate resistance loci were validated in the segregating populations and could be used in Anthracnose Fruit Rot Resistance (AFRR) breeding program. Chemotyping of bioactive metabolites in Hemidesmus indicus and Costus speciosus: The germplasm and rhizospheric soil of 141 samples of Costus speciosus (rhizome) and 96 samples of Hemidesmus indicus (root) were collected and passport datasheet was prepared and all the GPS coordinates were documented for each collection after mapping and actual field assessment. The collected rhizome/root samples were evaluated for quality parameters as per guidelines of The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India. Diosgenin and Vanillin are the bioactive 1- Resistant parent 1 (PBC 80); 2 - Susceptible parent (Belly); 3- Resistant parent 2 (PBC81) Amplification pattern of SSR markers in PBC-80, PBC-81 and Belly type chilli lines.
