Increasing growth rate of rohu in farmers’ ponds: The trials were conducted on different feeds such as cow dung, poultry litter, rice bran+mustard cake (1:1) in four ponds measuring 0.20 ha each in Jamui districts of Bihar. The pH value of all the ponds ranged from 7.4-8.8. Cow dung and poultry litter were used @ 40-50 kg/ha and rice bran+oil cake @ 1:1. The results based on the body weight of fish taken at DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 176 3-months intervals indicate that the maximum body weight of fish from the pond with rice + mustard oil cake was 248.2 gms followed by poultry litter (223.8 gms) and cow dung (203.5 gms), against 123.5 gms without feeding. Similar growth rate was also observed in next 6th month and 11th month. Thus rice bran + mustard oil cake gave best result than poultry litter and cow dung. However, poultry litter and cow dung could be used as fish feed to get additional production where the farmers can not provide rice bran + oil cake.
