 Ultimately, the Farmer FIRST Programme is a model of farmer participatory research. It empowers farmers to take an active role in problem-solving and decision-making, with scientists providing the necessary guidance. As India continues to evolve its agricultural strategies, this programme represents a beacon of hope for enhancing the livelihoods of the farming community through innovation, collaboration, and sustainable practices.

Malik, Z. A. Dar, Zahida Rashid and F. Rasool Krishi Vigyan Kendra Kupwara, Tangmarg, District Baramulla, Jammu and Kashmir 193 404 Maize (Zea mays L.), often termed the 'queen of cereals', has a high yield potential, yet in the Kupwara district of Jammu and Kashmir, productivity remains low due to factors like reliance on traditional varieties, limited seed replacement, and inadequate farming practices. In response, Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Kupwara, initiated a hybrid seed production program for Quality Protein Maize (QPM) variety Pusa Vivek-9 to address these challenges. Starting in 2021, this initiative expanded across multiple villages, demonstrating significant improvements in yield and income. The participatory program, which yielded 25 quintals of hybrid seed over three years, proved economically beneficial for local farmers. Farmers earned substantial income, with some achieving `1 lakh/0.25 ha and a benefit-cost ratio of 1:4. Beyond economic gains, this initiative improved food and nutrition security, making QPM a valuable component of local farming. The success of the project has motivated farmers in the district, with many adopting this technology to enhance their livelihoods. Keywords: Hybrid seed production, Maize, Pusa Vivek-9, Quality protein M AIZE (Zea mays L.), a C4 plant, has a yield potential far higher than other cereals, earning it the titles 'miracle crop' and 'queen of cereals.' Maize is a major cereal crop adaptable to diverse agro-climatic conditions worldwide. In India, it is the third most important crop after rice and wheat, occupying 8.67 million hectares with an average productivity of 25.7 q/ha, compared to the world average of 49.40 q/ha. In the Kupwara district, maize is a key kharif crop grown on 17,000 ha with an average yield of 18.5 q/ha, well below the national average. Challenges such as erratic rainfall, rainfed farming, small land holdings, reliance on local cultivars, imbalanced fertilizer use, and lack of plant protection and weed management practices have hindered productivity. One major issue contributing to low productivity is the unavailability of improved hybrid seeds and a low seed replacement rate. Traditional seed varieties no longer meet the needs of agricultural households in Kupwara, where drought reduces crop productivity, leading to food insecurity and malnutrition.
