The highest number of candidates appeared for the stream PCB (57.98%) followed by those in the streams ABC (25.67%), PCM (14.47%) and PCA (1.86%) (Table-2). The number Landscape of Higher Agricultural Education in India 19 of candidates opting for Agriculture stream was insignificant with < 2% of the total candidates having appeared in this stream. This could be attributed to the reason that Agriculture as a subject in school curriculum is available only in very few states and that too is optional instead of being compulsory. The average score obtained for PCM, PCB, PCA and ABC subject groups/ streams was 103.27, 153.65, 94.66 and 146.76, respectively (Table-3). Frequency distribution of marks secured by the candidates indicates that the highest number of candidates securing marks above 60% belonged to Stream PCB followed by those with Stream ABC and PCM, respectively. None of the candidates from Stream PCA could secure>60% marks (Table-4).
