 Monterisi et al. (2024) employed a multi-omics approach to investigate the role of protein hydrolysates (PHs) in nitrogen-limited lettuce plants. Their findings showed that PHs, particularly the low- molecular-weight fractions, act through hormone-like mechanisms to enhance nitrogen utilization, even under suboptimal nitrogen availability. These effects were linked to the upregulation of auxin and cytokinin bio- synthesis pathways, the activation of multifaceted antioxidant responses, and enhanced cell wall plasticity, which collectively boosted plant growth and biomass accumulation under low nitrogen conditions. Pathak et al. (2024) demonstrated the synergistic potential of combining microbial and non-microbial biostimulants in wheat. They developed bioinoculants that significantly improved germina- tion, root architecture, and nutrient content by integrating a func- tionally competent synthetic microbial community with humic acid or seaweed extracts. Their field trials revealed that wheat plants treated with these integrated biostimulants achieved a 40% increase in grain yield and a substantial increase in macro- and micronutrient profiles. This study underscores the importance of blending microbial diversity with biostimulants to combine agricul- tural productivity and sustainability. Velasco-Clares et al. (2024) investigated the application of a seaweed-derived biostimulant enriched with bioactive anti-stress compounds under optimal growth conditions. Lettuce plants treated with the biostimulant at an optimal dose of 300 mL/hL showed improved biomass produc- tion, enhanced photosynthetic activity, and enriched phytohor- mones, amino acids, and mineral nutrient profiles. The treatment also stimulated nitrogen assimilation, antioxidant capacity, and concentrations of key antioxidant compounds, contributing to higher crop quality and potential stress resilience. However, the study highlighted the risk of phytotoxic effects at higher doses, such as 500 mL/hL, emphasizing the critical importance of proper dosage for maximizing the benefits of biostimulants.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, Bahmani and Prithiviraj (2024) demonstrated that extracts from Ascophyllum nodosum regulate flowering time through the “MIR156-mediated age pathway”, a central mechanism in develop- mental transitions. These extracts modulate the balance between key flowering regulators by repressing MIR156, a negative regulator, and enhancing SPLs and MIR172, which promote flowering while downre- gulating floral repressors like AP2-like genes.
