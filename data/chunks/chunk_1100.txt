4% total fat, and 1.3–2.7% total ash content. The total dietary fibre content of millet grains ranges from 6–12%. Millets are good source of micronutrients including minerals and B-vitamins as well as phytochemicals with health benefits. Indian Farming 73 (01): 88-90; January 2023 Millet grains Source: ICAR-IIMR Indian Farming 89 January 2023 Carbohydrates: Similar to other cereals, carbohydrate forms the major nutritional component of millet grains. Starch constitutes the major carbohydrate in millets and represents about 55–78% of grain weight. Soluble sugars including sucrose, glucose, fructose, raffinose, stachyose form the minor carbohydrate fraction of millets. Dietary fibre: The dietary fibre components are concentrated on the pericarp and endosperm part of the grain. Millets are good source of dietary fibre. Both major and small millets possess dietary fibre higher than rice while, pearl, finger and barnyard millet possess dietary fibre comparable to or better than wheat. Proteins: Millet grains are good source of protein. They possess higher protein content as compared to rice and maize, and on par with wheat. Among the millet grains, foxtail and proso millet have the highest protein content (~12.3 and 11.5%, respectively), which is higher than the protein content of wheat (10.6%). Regarding the amino acid composition, like most cereals, millets are deficient in lysine. Pearl millet has a balanced essential amino acid composition, among the millet grains. Being gluten-free, these grains are a source of protein for people who suffer from celiac disease. Fat: Fat or lipids are mainly concentrated on the germ layer of millet grains. The fat content of these grains varies from 1.7% in sorghum to 5.4% in pearl millet. The relatively higher fat content of the pearl millet partly explains the shorter shelf-life of pearl millet flour. Regarding the fatty acid composition, millets contain unsaturated fatty acids including the essential fatty acids, viz. linoleic acid and linolenic acid. Micronutrients: Millets are rich sources of micronutrients including minerals and vitamins, especially the B-vitamins. The important minerals found in millet grains are presented in Table 2. Most millets contain good amount of phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K) etc and finger millet is a rich source of calcium (Ca). In fact, the calcium content of finger millet (364 mg/100 g) is the highest known for any cereal. One hundred gram of finger millet is sufficient to meet more than a quarter of the RDA of calcium of an adult human being. Also, millets, especially, pearl millet is a good source of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). Table 2.
