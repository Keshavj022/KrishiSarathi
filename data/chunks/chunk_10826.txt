Fertilizer mixture comprising 180 g N + 100 g P2 O5+ 250 g K2O per plant/year is ideal. The full dose of phosphorus and half dose of potassium is applied at the time of planting while nitrogen is given in 3 split doses at 2, 4 and 6 months after planting.   Daughter-suckers should be removed promptly until the mother-plant flowers.   The removal of dry leaves and useless pseudostems.   The propping of plants with bamboo poles after flowering is also necessary.

If pallet feed not available use locally available materials such as Rice bran and Mustard oil cake @ 1:1   Fish Seed Management - Keep fish seed healthy and monitor the growth daily. If the fish seed could not be sold out in time shift to bigger size pond and manage it properly.   Fish Disease Management - Observe fish health regularly.
