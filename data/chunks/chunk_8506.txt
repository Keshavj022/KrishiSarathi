 At Bihar, maximum total cured leaf and first-grade leaf yields of chewing tobacco have been recorded when 50% of N as ammonium sulphate and 50% as castor-cake were applied. Crop Protection Three alley crops, jowar, maize and bajra, grown as border to tobacco, were significantly superior to when they were grown as strips in reducing stem-borer, tobacco caterpillar, tobacco budworm, tobacco leaf-curl vector and tobacco aphid in tobacco. Budworm Helicoverpa armigera damage to FCV tobacco was more when high N was applied, but K application reduced the incidence and damage. Tracer 48 SC, Avaunt 14.5 SC, Cascade 10 DC, Rampage 10 SC at 100 g a.i./ha and Larvin 75 WP at 750 g a.i./ha are found effective against tobacco budworm. Entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae talc-based formulation was found effective at 1 × 105 IJ/m2, in succession with NPV at 1.5 × 1012 PIBs/ha to contain seedling damage caused by Spodoptera litura (15.33 seedlings). EPN alone FCV tobacco variety Hemadri has been recommended for identification for traditional black soils in rainfed areas of Andhra Pradesh. It has showed a yield potential of 2,500 kg/ha Burley tobacco variety Sweta has been recommended for identification for light soils of Andhra Pradesh in monsoonic conditions. It has a yield potential of 2,000 kg/ha DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 46 was effective at 4 × 105 IJ/m2 with seedlings damaged totalling to 22/m2 compared to control (121.66 seedlings). Five accessions MD 40, 872, 201, Coker 129 and Speight G 41 have been graded as resistant to TMV; 9, Coker 129, 297, 371, MD 10, 872, NC 73, 2326, DB 10 and Va 310 resistant to black shank and 5, MD 609, NC 2326, HV 92 2, 92 4 and VR 2 showed resistance to root-knot nematode (RKI <1). In FCV tobacco nursery, bordeaux mixture at 0.5% up to 35 DAS, followed by 2 foliar sprays with Propiconazole (Tilt 25% EC) at 0.05% have been recommended for controlling leaf and stem infection phases of anthracnose. SEED PRODUCTION AND TECHNOLOGY BREEDER SEED PRODUCTION During 2001–2002, a total of 3,064.36 tonnes of breeder seed have been produced; major quantities belonged to oilseeds (1,335.72 tonnes) and cereals (1,101.13 tonnes), followed by pulses (562.53 tonnes), forages (45.82 tonnes) and fibres (19.16 tonnes). Besides, additional breeder seed was also produced against indent of state- level varieties. Seed Technology Diagnostic characterization. A massive programme on variety characterization major field crops has been taken up for morphological characters, chemical tests and electrophoretic banding pattern. The work is being harmonized with the National Test Guidelines for DUS. Economics of hybrid seed production. In cotton, the cost:benefit ratio is economical in Hyderabad (1 : 2.22), Dharwad (1 : 1.95) and Akola (1 : 1.8) for hybrid seed production. Hyderabad is also beneficial for castor and sorghum, and Bangalore is ideal for sunflower hybrid seed production. Seed coating.
