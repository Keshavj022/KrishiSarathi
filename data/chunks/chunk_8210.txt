 Average emission of all GHGs (g/ha/day) was higher in fish culture ponds (CH4 –3.62 to 7.86; CO2 – 1056 to 1758; N2O – 0.31 to 1.11) compared to shrimp culture ponds (CH4 – 1.88 to 5.14; CO2 – 423 to 883; N2O – 0.07 to 0.35). GHGs emission in terms of CO2 eq. in nursery (up to 300 g), growout 1 (up to 1 kg) and growout 2 (up to 3 kg) ponds of Lates calcarifer ranged from 78 to 190, 118 to 224 and 155 to 245 kg/ha, respectively. Overall, emission was higher during summer compared to winter and significantly reduced during rainy season. Aquaculture ponds acted as sink during low temperature conditions and rainy days. Shift in fish catch structure along lower Sundarbans: Changes in environmental parameters, viz. water and sediment quality, salinity, nutrient cycling, plankton and macro-zoo-benthos abundance, etc. have triggered changes in finfish and shellfish diversity in Sundarban estuary. Though, there is an overall increase in total fish landings from 7,431 tonnes during 2009- 10 to 11,962 tonnes in 2015-16, the catch compositions indicated a gradual replacement of commercially important species by relatively low priced fish species with short life span. The percentage contribution of Harpadon nehereus, a most dominant species in winter bag net fishery, has reduced from 27.25% in 2009–10 to 12.33% in 2015–16. The winter fish catch is dominated by low priced species, Secutor insidiator, which recorded a marked increase in landings from 0.09% in 2009–10 to 17.90% during 2015–16. Similarly, increase in catches of sardines (Sardinella gibbosa, S. longiceps and S. fimbriata) was recorded from 0.48% in 2009–10 to 10.66% in 2015–16. The bag net catches are dominated by invertebrates (73.5%) comprising prawns (58.5%), crabs (11.65%), stomatopods (2.10%) and cephalopods (1.26%). Non-penaeid prawns (mainly Acetes spp.) have emerged as one of the most dominant fisheries. ❑ 4. Genetic Resources Crops Germplasm augmentation, conservation and use: Seventeen explorations were undertaken in eight states and 1,115 accessions, including 531 of wild species, were collected. Three hundred and eighty-seven herbarium specimens were added to the National Herbarium of Cultivated Plants. The National Gene bank germplasm for long-term storage comprised 10,224 accessions of orthodox seed species; along with cryopreservation of 14 shoot tips/ meristems of vegetatively propagated species and 14 accessions in in-vitro Gene bank. A total of 31,110 accessions were imported from 39 countries, which included international trial material (32,684 accessions). Promising introductions were: rice with high yield (EC 881897- 903), salinity (EC 881904-1905) and submergence tolerance (EC 881906 and EC 887557) from the Philippines; maize with red coloured cob (PI 550473 and PI 558532) with genes Vip3Aa20, Cry2A.127 (Mod E) and Cry1A.
