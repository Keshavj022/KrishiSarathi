 The seeds are either sown directly in the field or the seedlings are raised in the polythene bags or plug trays in mid December to mid January for early summer crops. The 1-2 true leaf stage of seedlings is transplanted in the main field. The best time to plant bottle gourds is late June or early July for kharif season while in spring- summer, sowing should be done in the month of February-March. For direct sowing, four seeds are sown in each pit at a depth of 2 cm. About 1-1.5 kg seed is required to cover 1 ha area. The pointed side of the seed facing down is good for better germination and the seeds start germinating after 4th day. After germination, Lalu Prasad Yadav*, Gangadhara K, V V Apparao, A K Singh and D K Samadiya Research Thar Avani: A novel variety of round shape bottle gourd Thar Avani was developed at ICAR-Central Horticultural Experiment Station (CIAH- RS), Godhra, Gujarat through hybridization followed by selection. The fruits are round in shape with 22.8 cm length, 39.4 cm girth, 8.1-8.7° TSS, 21.6 mg/100g ascorbic acid and 12.91 kg fruit weight. It has comparatively higher antioxidant contents and activity in fruit, epicarp, mesocarp and leaves. It also recorded comparatively higher potassium (1641.14), magnesium (155.36), iron (12.42) and copper (0.24) in fruit, and calcium (610.73), magnesium (158.17), iron (1.86), and copper (0.29) in leaves (mg/100 g dw). Thar Avani fruit ready for culinary purpose Indian Horticulture 4 the two healthy seedlings are maintained in each pit and the remaining unhealthy seedlings are thinned out. It grows up to 3.0 m; hence more plants can be accommodated by planting at 2.0 × 1.5 m or 2.0 × 1.0 m spacing. Training and pruning It requires proper training and pruning for getting good quality fruits with higher yield. Training plants to bower helps to tap sunlight more effectively to increase yield. After germination of seed, the vine is to be trailed on bower system with the help of jute string. Axillary buds of growing vines should be removed till vines reach the bower height. When vine is likely to touch bower, apical bud is removed at 10-15 cm below bower to allow 2 or 3 branches to spread over bower. After formation of 4-5 fruits, vines are again pruned allowing 2-3 axillary buds only to grow on primary vines. It is also advisable to remove all yellow and pale coloured older leaves near bottom portion. field preparation with half dose of nitrogen and full dose of phosphorus and potassium. The application of 60-80 kg N, 40-60 kg P and 60-80 kg K is ideal recommended dose/ha. The application of 50:25:50 g urea, single super phosphate and murate of potash, respectively to each pit at 30 days after sowing is used to enhance the yield. Irrigation Bottle gourd is a deep rooted crop, it has been observed that the roots may reach even 1.5 m below ground level to get water; hence, it can tolerate dry conditions fairly well.
