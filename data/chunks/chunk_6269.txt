INTRODUCTION Indigenous Technical Knowledge (ITK) in agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries and other land-based activities is being used since ages by the farmers, animal owners and other practitioners. Advancement in scientific knowledge in agriculture has questioned on rationality of ITKs and replaced these ITK-based practices. The problems of sustainability of modern scientific technologies and their impact on ecosystem and environment has evoked the interest on ITKs during the recent past. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) implemented a Mission Mode Project on ‘Collection, Documentation and Validation of Indigenous Technical Knowledge’ under National Agricultural Technology Project (NATP) in 2002. The project aimed at collecting and documenting the ITKs in agriculture and other land-based activities as well as studying their efficacy and validity through experimentation for establishing scientific rationality. The project activities were guided, monitored and supervised by an apex level committee (ITK Information Committee) with all DDGs of ICAR and eminent scientists as members. Information on ITK were initially collected from the secondary sources like journals, reports, thesis, etc. and documented in a 411-paged publication entitled ‘Inventory of Indigenous Technical Knowledge in agriculture - Document 1’. Subsequently, information on indigenous knowledge-based practices were collected from primary sources through voluntary disclosures. These have been documented in three publications entitled ‘Inventory of Indigenous Technical Knowledge in Agriculture - Document 2’ and its supplements 1 and 2.
