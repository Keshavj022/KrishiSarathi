 In liquid medium using zinc phosphate as substrate, the solubilizing capability among the bacterial isolates ranged between 11.17 to 13.59 ppm and that of fungal isolates were up to 13.18 ppm. Identified bacterial zinc solubilizers are different species of the genus Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Microbacterium. CAM transition in groundnut for achieving drought tolerance: Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) transited groundnut genotypes have been identified which can be cultivated with 20–70% less water without any significant loss in yield. These are variants of a popular groundnut variety TG37A. Seven drought-tolerant CAM variants of a popular groundnut variety TG37A such as DGRMB 3, DGRMB 5, DGRMB 13, DGRMB 17, DGRMB 19, DGRMB 29 and DGRMB 31 were evaluated alongside TG37A with only two irrigations after emergence equivalent to 120 mm rainfall. While the pod yield reduction in TG37A was around 49%, it varied between 32–40% in the CAM variants. CAM variants such as DGRMB 19 (4,110 kg/ha), DGRMB 24 (4,040 kg/ha), DGRMB 32 (4,000 kg/ha) and DGRMB 5 (3,920 kg/ha) out-yielded pod yield of TG37A (3,177 kg/ha) under rainfed conditions (around 700 mm of rainfall during crop growth). Two of these CAM variants of TG37A (DGRMB 5 and DGRMB 19) also exhibited salinity tolerance. The Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) model: The IFS models, viz. Agri (0.8 ha)- horti (0.2), Agri (0.8)-api (0.1) system, Agri (0.8)-mushroom farming (0.1), Agri (0.8)- horti (0.2)- api system, Agri (0.8)- horti (0.1)- mushroom farming (0.05), Agri (0.8)- api- mushroom farming (0.2) were developed. The highest net income was found under Agri (0.8)- horti (0.2)- api system with net income ` 5,62,943. Post-harvest management of sucrose losses in sugarcane: Four promising sugarcane varieties, viz. CoLk 94184, CoLk 09204, CoPK 05191 and Co 0238 were established following normal agronomical practices, and post-harvest sucrose losses and their management using chemical formulation (0.1% SMS + 0.2% BKC) were carried out. Among these varieties, post-harvest deterioration (after 11 days of cane harvest) in terms of reducing sugars (RS) and sucrose % juice was observed maximum in CoLk 09204, an increase of RS from 0.94 to 20.33 and decrease of sucrose % juice from 17.59 to 12.19 in control and 0.94 to 13.67 in RS and 17.59 to 15.78 in sucrose % juice in SMS+BKC treated canes. The least increase in RS was observed in Co 0238 (0.44 to 10.80 in control and 0.44 to 9.10 in treated), whereas most responsive variety to formulation was CoLk 94184 where RS reduction from control to treated cane was from 14.86 to 8.82% (6.04%) after 11 days of post-harvest. Maximum reduction in sucrose % juice due to delayed crushing in comparison to fresh crushing in control condition was observed in CoLk 09204 (17.59 to 12.06 on seventh day) and minimum reduction was observed in CoLk 94184 (17.59 to 16.84 on eleventh day).
