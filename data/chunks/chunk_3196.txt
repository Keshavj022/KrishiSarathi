 • For the benefit of residue research in the country, all the methods developed and validated in the AINP on Pesticide Residues has been compiled and published in the form of book “Pesticide Residues Analysis Manual” . • The strengthening of residue research in the country is one of the main objectives of AINP on Pesticide Residues. Various training programmes on the techniques of pesticide residue analysis have been conducted at the project coordinating cell. The repository of certified reference material of pesticides is also maintained at the PC cell from where CRM are distributed to laboratories all over the country every year. • This AINP is also enabling the National Pesticide Residue Monitoring Programme, undertaken by Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, GOI. www.icar.org.in 73 2002 ‐ 2007 All India Coordinated Research Project on Pigeonpea 1.

Research Achievements (New varieties/Technologies Developed/validated and being practiced in the last five years) (2002‐2007): • During last five years seven high yielding varieties of pigeonpea namely MA 6, GAUT 001E, MAL 13, GTH 1, CORG 9701, NDA 98‐1, NDA 99‐6 and one CMS based hybrid (For Gujarat state) have been developed • Application of 20 kg sulphur with 100 kg DAP/ha was beneficial to enhance the productivity of pigeonpea. • Application of Pendimethalin @ 1.25 kg a.i./ha for weed control was found most effective. • Production of Pigeonpea can be increased by 15% by inoculation with rhizobium culture. • By ridge bed sowing production of pigeonpea can be increased by 15‐20%. www.icar.org.in 74 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science All India Coordinated Research Project on Plant Parasitic Nematodes With Integrated Approach for Their Control 1.
