The food processing sector is one of the most labour intensive sector and thus generates gainful additional employment. ICAR pioneered the concept of Agro-Processing Centers (APC) since 1980 in production catchments by providing technical guidance and monitoring. These APCs have an impact in terms of reduction of storage and processing losses, higher recovery, cost saving, energy saving, timeliness of operation, premium price for better quality, maintaining hygienic conditions and improved comforts and social and economic wellbeing of different stakeholders. Two hundred and sixty APCs have been established through explicit intervention of ICAR, each of which generates direct employment to 4-6 persons and average annual profit of Rs. five lakhs. 5.4.2. Protected/covered crop cultivation The Department of Chemicals & Petrochemicals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, first considered the promotion and development of use of plastics in agriculture and irrigation for improving agricultural yields, quality of produce and improving input use efficiency in 1977. National Committee on use of Plastics in Agriculture (NCPA) was set up in 1981 to identify areas for use of plastics in agriculture, R&D programmes and to suggest plan for implementation. Plasticulture Development Centres (PDCs) were started in 1985- 86. NCPA was transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare in 1993. NCPA was renamed as National Committee on Plasticulture Applications in Horticulture (NCPAH) and the PDC was renamed as PFDC (Precision Farming Development Centre). At present there are 22 PFDCs all over India. Fig. 4.
