 The availability of high yielding varieties with efficient plant type for different situations can provide 3-2.0 tons/ ha stable seed yield to compete with other crops. Major biotic stresses in West Bengal are wilt, root rot and BGM. These biotic stresses reduce the productivity of the crop by 30-50%. Other important constraints are terminal moisture and heat stress, non-availability of quality seeds of improved varieties, non-adoption of improved production technologies, inadequate and unbalanced use of fertilizer, delayed sowing, poor plant population due to low seed rates and weed infestation.   West Bengal has been the highest producer of jute and produces nearly 70% of the country’s raw jute fibres. With its insignificant coverage, it plays a predominant role in the country’s economy by generating employment, using in the textile as well as paper industries, improving soil fertility, earning foreign exchange etc. Jute is cultivated by small and marginal farmers. Thus, the investment capacity is poor. Technically, there is poor adoption of technology, imbalance fertilizer application, poor plant protection measure in jute cultivation. There is shortage of improved variety seed. Jute cultivation is labour intensive for weeding, thinning, extraction of fiber cutting / soaking, stripping, washing and drying. 639 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022   Potato production in West Bengal has witnessed a five -fold increase in the last 40 years. The State is second largest producer of potato with high yield (19.73 t/ha) second only to Uttar Pradesh (22.8 t/ha) and produces 30% of the total potato in the country. The importance of potato cultivation has increased day by day and the farmers have shifted from traditional rice -based cropping system to high value cash crops like potato in the rabi season. Per hectare yield in potato is higher in the Statethan at all India level. However, the State is totally dependent on other States like Punjab for meeting the seed potato requirements. Absence of exclusive cold storage facilities for seed potato is affecting seed quality and viability. Potato in the West Bengal is grown mainly by small and marginal farmers who face problems of getting remunerative market price, sufficient credit/bank loans and cold storage facilities.   The horticulture sector in West Bengal is wide ranging and produces considerable amounts of vegetables, fruits and nuts, spices, medicinal plants, aromatic plants, mushroom etc. under different agro-climatic conditions. West Bengal is the leading vegetable growing State in India. The State has immense potential for development in horticulture sector both through horizontal (area expansion) and vertical integration (productivity improvement). Despite the impressive achievements, still low productivity of vegetables in the State is a challenge and matter of concern.
