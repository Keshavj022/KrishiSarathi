 California Mastitis Test (CMT) was carried out before treatment and 10 days after treatment (PT). (Schalm et al. 1971). CMT was carried out immediately by the side of the cattle at the time of milking, by mixing equal quantity of milk and CMT reagent. 2. Somatic Cell Count (SCC) was done before treatment and 10 days PT. (Schalm et al. 1971). SCC was done by preparing milk smear over the clean microscopic slide and stained by New Man's Lampert stain. 3. Bacterial isolation was done before treatment and 10 days PT (Griffin et al. 1974). it was done in bovine blood agar and on Tryticase agar. Table 1.

The farmers were asked to assign scores out of 10 to represent the utility of C. album as compared to allopathic and homoeopathic RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PRA and field study Matrix was developed to compare the efficacy of C. album in terms of reduction in swelling of affected quarters (hours after treatment), as also in terms of recovery in days after treatment (PT) in comparison to homoeopathic and allopathic treatments with which farmers were well   VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Fig. 3.
