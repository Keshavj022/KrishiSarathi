 Establishing linkage to the National Level portal related to scientific equipment â€” use and management: The Government of India has established a web portal called as LSTEM (Indian Science Technology & Engineering facilities Map). The web site of this portal is www.istem.gov.in. The main objective of this portal is linking researchers and resources of all research organizations in India. All the ICAR Institutes must ensure (mandatory) to list all their scientific equipment costing more than &2.5 million on this portal. ICAR institutes will follow I-STEM guidelines as given in the I-STEM portal. Important Note: 1. The Director/Competent Authority will certify and submit a report annually, with respect to adherence to the guidelines provided in the scientific equipment policy and difficulties, if any, to the DDGs of the respective SMDs with a copy to ADG (ICT). 2. It is also advised that the Director/Competent Authority may adopt a flexi approach, depending upon the scientific strength and available facilities in the respective institute, for effective implementation of the guidelines on Scientific Equipment Policy. 19 HDT ICAR SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT POLICY Annexure-I LIST OF ICAR - ADVANCED NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC FACILITIES IN DIFFERENT INSTITUTES SI.
