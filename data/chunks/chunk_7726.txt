 Phylogenetic analysis of serotype O virus revealed extended and exclusive dominance of lineage Ind2001 strains. The lineage Ind2001 is dominating the scenario since 2008 with emergence of sub-lineage Ind2001d in 2008 and sub-lineage Ind2001e in 2016. At present the National FMD virus Repository holds 2,278 isolates (O- 1574, A-323, C-15 and Asia 1-366). Under National FMD Serosurveillance, overall seropositivity in 20.02% samples/animals was observed, which is comparatively lesser than the previous year’s average of 21.2%. To assess the effectiveness of vaccination under FMDCP seromonitoring program, 231,983 serum samples were tested. The results were communicated to DAHD. Vaccine candidate strain: A total of 34 serotype O were antigenically characterized. The field situation Pulling capacity and biochemical indices of Halari donkeys The study showed that Halari donkeys may pull draught of 33 kg for 3 hr; 44, 55, 66 kg for 2 hr; 77, 88 kg for 1 hr without much stress to donkeys as fatigue score was less than 7. The fatigue symptoms (tongue protrusion and frothing) were not present in donkeys as heat loss in donkeys is by sweating and not by panting. Halari donkeys could be used in pulling the load till the animal is tired means when the fatigue score is less than 14. However, for using the donkeys in continuous and regular type work, the fatigue score should be less than 7 for keeping the animal healthy and productive. Bacteriophages against Staphylococcus spp: The experiments revealed that the synergistic effect of bacteriophages and antibiotics may provide a better alternative to kill virulent bacteria than either treatment given individually in mastitic bovines. Characterization of bacteriophages against Klebsiella pneumonia: A new bacteriophage (VTCCBPA119) was isolated against Klebsiella pneumonia. The phage is temperature tolerant in the range of 4°C to 55°C and within a narrow pH range of 6 - 9. The biological activity assessment of the phage showed it to be strongly lytic against only two (2/10) of K. pneumonia tested. A new phage against a laboratory induced resistant mutant was obtained. The resistant mutant of Staphylococcus spp (RM Fop 171A) was generated. Diagnosis of glanders and equine infectious anaemia (EIA): ICAR-NRCE developed a recombinant Hep1 antigen ELISA. It has been duly validated in India and the OIE Reference Laboratory, Germany and showed excellent sensitivity (97.2%) and specificity (99.6%). This technology was transferred to 8 State Disease LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 83 suggested that majority of the isolates were antigenically homologous to currently used vaccine strain INDR2/ 1975. The isolates of serotype Asia1 were also antigencially covered by currently used vaccine strain IND63/1972.
