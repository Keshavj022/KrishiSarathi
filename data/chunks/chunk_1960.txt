Remote Sensing and Satellite Imagery in Agriculture Remote sensing involves the collection of information about objects or areas without direct physical contact. In agriculture, it can play a pivotal role in monitoring and managing crops, soil, and environmental conditions. Satellites are a crucial platform for remote sensing applications. In agriculture, satellite imagery can provide a comprehensive view of large agricultural landscapes. Remote sensing and satellite imagery are integral components of precision agriculture, which can offer valuable insights for farmers and agricultural stakeholders. These technologies may contribute to data-driven decision-making, optimized resource usage, and enhanced overall farm management.
