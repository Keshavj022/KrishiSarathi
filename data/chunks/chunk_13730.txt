However, ZT without residue incorporation re- sulted in poor soil fertility and inﬁltration (Verhulst et al., 2011) which provide unfavorable environment for weeds to emerge and grow. Our results are conﬁrmed by Dash et al. (2020) who stat- ed that IWM practices are more compatible and viable to control diverse weed ﬂora in conservation agriculture production system. IWM treatment inclusion of crop rotation breach life cycle of weeds and reduce their persistence (Rao, 2000); hand weeding re- duces the enrichment of weed seed bank which counteract diverse weed ﬂora (Baghel et al.
