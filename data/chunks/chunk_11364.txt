 Besides hand weeding, weeds can be controlled by various pre-planting herbicides like oxyfluorfen) @ 0.50L a.i./ha or pendamethalin @1.5 L a.i/ha followed by one hand weeding after 45 days of transplanting. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 56 KAsHmIR RegIoN Wheat Recommended varieties are Shalimar Wheat -1, VL-738 and HS- 240. Field should be ploughed at proper moisture condition. After 2-3 ploughings, one planking is desirable. For wheat, urea @ 4 kg/kanal, DAP @ 6.5 kg/kanal, MOP 2.5 kg/ kanal and zinc sulphate @ 0.75-1.0 kg/kanal should be applied as basal dose at the time of last ploughing and then level the land by planking before seed sowing. Sowing should be done in rows keeping row to row distance of 23 cm and at a depth of 4-5cm and completed between 10th to 20th October. Seed rate of 100 kg/ha is recommended. However, in case of delayed sowing seed rate may be increased by 20 % i.e 120 kg/ha. Weeds can be controlled by application of post emergence herbicide like sulfosulfuron @ 30 g a.i./ha or Isoproturon 1.5 kg a.i /ha + 2,4- D @ 0.5 kg a.i /ha at 30-35 days after sowing. During Feb-March as soon as the growth starts in the last week of month apply top dose of urea @ 3.25 kg/kanal Brown Sarson Recommended varieties are Shalimar Brown Sarson-1, Shalimar Brown Sarson-2, Shalimar Brown Sarson-3. Apply well decomposed compost or FYM uniformly @ 10-15 t/ha. Application of vermicompost @ 2.5 t /ha will replace 5 t FYM/ha and 25% NPK from recommended dose of fertilizers. For brown sarson urea @ 2.2 kg/kanal, DAP @ 5.5 kg/kanal, MOP 3.35 kg/kanal, Gypsum @ 6.25-7.5 kg/kanal and Borex @ 0.5 kg/ kanal should be applied as basal dose before sowing of seeds. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 57 Pre-sowing irrigation for quick germination of crop is desirable where soil moisture is low. Pre-emergence application of pendemethalin @ 1 kg a.i./ha within 2-3 Days After Sowing. Seed can be sown in first fortnight of October with a spacing of 30 cm row to row x 10 cm plant to plant andshould be treated with Captan @ 2-3 g per kg for control of seed borne diseases. For line sowing7.5 kg/haseed is required, for broadcasting10-15 kg/ha Partial thinning along with hand weeding should be done at 25-35 days after sowing of brown sarson. During Feb.-March apply top dose of urea @ 2.25 kg/kanal. Field Pea Recommended varieties are Shalimar Pea-1, Rachna and Prakash, HUDP-15, VL-45, &HFP-715 For pea cultivation 2-3 ploughings accompanied by planking will be sufficient to obtain desired seed bed. Apply well decomposed compost or FYM uniformly @ 10-15 t/ha at the time of land preparation. Application of vermicompost @ 2.5 t /ha will replace 5 t FYM/ha and 25% NPK from recommended dose of fertilizers. For pea, urea @ 0.75 kg/kanal, DAP @ 6.5 kg/kanal, and MOP 3.4 kg/kanal should be applied as basal dose at the time of last ploughing and then level the land by planking before seed sowing. Seed can be sown from 15th October to ending November@60 to 65 kg /ha.
