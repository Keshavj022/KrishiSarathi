 Crop Production Guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) - taramira (Eruca sativa) sequence with 40 kg S/ha to taramira has been found more remunerative than fallow-taramira sequence, ● ●● ●● An early-maturing, Spanish groundnut VG 9521 has been released for Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and southern Maharashtra for kharif. ● Epicuticular wax load can be used as a selection criterion for drought tolerance in groundnut. ● ●● ●● Gobhi sarson TERI (OE) R 03 with low erucic acid (< 2%) has been identified for release. GROUNDNUT GENOTYPES IDENTIFIED FOR IMPORTANT TRAITS Ca-efficient NRCG 7085-1, 6820, 6919, MOR 161, ICGHNG 88448 P-efficient NRCG 7085-1, 1308, 6155, PBS 13, PBS 18057, 20016, MOR 204, PBS, 11037, 20016, 20057 and MOR 139 Tolerance to ICG 813, 1001, aluminium toxicity 1021, 1048, 1056, 1064, 1355, 3606, 10964, 11183 High oil content ICGV 86590, (> 51%) ICGS 1, ICGS 21, HNG (HPS) 2, GG 12 and CSMG 884 DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 28 and has been recommended for semi-arid eastern plains zone of Rajasthan. Jute (Corchorus olitorius) -toria (Brassica campestris var. toria), followed by rice (Oryza sativa)-toria, with 40 kg S/ha to toria proved remunerative and have been recommended for Assam. SOYBEAN Crop Improvement Soybean MAUS 61 with moderate resistance to soybean rust, has been identified for southern Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and other parts of peninsular India. The variety also possesses marginal yield superiority over ruling varieties. Soybean LSb 1 for Andhra Pradesh and Palam Soya for Himachal Pradesh have been released. The National Active Germplasm Site (NAGS) of the National Research Centre on Soybean maintains nearly 2,500 germplasm lines collected/introduced from diverse sources. Superior breeding lines, Doko (Brazil) for resistance to mechanical damage; EC 391339, EC 394839 (PI 240644), EC 394837 (Sant Maria) for long juvenility; EC 34500 and DS 396 for insect resistance have been identified for use in breeding programmes. Hardee and Punjab 1 showed lowest level of trypsin inhibitor among Indian varieties. This trait will enhance food uses of soybean. Fourteen new soybean releases have been conserved at the National Gene Bank for the long-term storage. Crop Production In soybean-wheat system, application of FYM at 10 tonnes/ha along with recommended inorganic nutrients gave net returns of Rs 44,346/ha with C : B ratio of 1 : 2.16. Significant soybean equivalent yield could be obtained in soybean-wheat cropping system than soybean-chickpea and soybean-mustard systems. Soybean-linseed system was comparable with soybean-wheat. Maximum net returns (Rs 23,743/ha) could be obtained in soybean-wheat system and the highest C: B ratio (1 : 3.26) was observed in soybean-linseed. The highest soybean equivalent yield was recorded with minimum tillage. This indicates the possibility of reducing tillage for crop sequence, and thereby minimizing cost of production.
