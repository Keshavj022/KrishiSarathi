 This involves monitoring the model’s performance and retraining it periodically to adapt to changing conditions and ensure its relevance Predictive models for precision farming Step 3: Feature engineering In this step, domain experts and data scientists select or create relevant features (variables) from the preprocessed data that have a significant impact on the agricultural outcomes. These features could include soil pH, moisture content, temperature, precipitation, crop type, historical yield data, etc. Step 6: Model evaluation After training, the model’s performance is evaluated using validation data that the model has not seen before. The evaluation helps to determine how well the model generalizes to unseen data and whether it meets the desired accuracy criteria FIGURE 3: Process diagram of creating predictive models for precision farming.

Data analytics and AI integration: The vast amount of data collected by drone-based sensors requires sophisticated data analytics and AI algorithms for processing and extracting meaningful insights. AI- driven image recognition and pattern detection can automate the analysis of aerial imagery, enabling fas- ter, and more accurate decision-making. Drone-based sensors have proven to be versatile and indispensable tools for remote sensing and aerial data acqui- sition across various industries. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more advanced sensors and capabilities, further expanding the applications and beneﬁts of drones in diverse ﬁelds. 4.2. Hyperspectral Imaging: High-Resolution Crop Monitoring and Analysis. Hyperspectral imaging is a powerful technology that has revolutionized high-resolution crop monitoring and analysis in precision agriculture. Unlike conventional RGB cameras that record three main color wavelengths (red, green, and blue), hyperspectral cameras record numerous narrow and adjacent spectral bands across the electromagnetic spec- trum. This capability allows for detailed spectral signatures of crops and vegetation, providing valuable insights into their health, nutrient content, stress levels, and overall condition.
