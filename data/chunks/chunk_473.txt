Millets may contribute to sustainable agriculture practices, preserve water resources, increase soil health, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by adding them into farming systems. Declaring an International Year of Millets can raise awareness of the importance of sustainable agricultural practices and encourage their widespread adoption. Biodiversity conservation: Millets are part of the world’s agricultural biodiversity and are available in various types, colours, and sizes. Encouraging the cultivation and consumption of millets can contribute to the preservation of traditional and indigenous seed varieties, conserving agro-biodiversity, and safeguarding cultural heritage associated with these crops. Economic opportunities: Millets have the potential to generate economic opportunities, particularly for smallholder farmers and rural communities. By promoting the production, processing, and marketing of millets, the International Year of Millets can raise awareness about their economic value, create market demand, and support income generation in rural areas. Future thrusts Despite their high nutritional value, millets are consumed at a lesser rate than other basic crops. This tendency is influenced by a variety of things. For instance, customers, particularly in metropolitan areas, are unaware of the health advantages and nutritional worth of millets. Traditional millet consumption knowledge and cultural practices have also declined over time. To remedy this, it is critical to improve public awareness and educate people about millets’ nutritional advantages and culinary flexibility. Urbanization and globalization have resulted in a shift in dietary choices towards processed and convenient meals. Millets, being ancient grains, have fallen out of favour with newer generations who are more exposed to modern dietary options. Furthermore, the assumption that millets are linked with lower socioeconomic level has led to their consumption fall. Millet consumption is further hampered by a lack of availability and accessibility. Historically, agricultural policy and market focus have favoured high-yielding crops like rice, wheat, and maize, resulting in restricted supply and selling prospects for millets. This makes it difficult for customers to include millets in their diets. Overall, the designation of an International Year of Millets can help raise awareness, mobilize support, and catalyze actions at the national and international levels to promote sustainable agriculture, enhance food security, improve nutrition, and preserve agricultural biodiversity. SUMMARY The resurgence of millets in modern agriculture signifies a return to ancient wisdom in addressing contemporary challenges. In conclusion, millets stand as ancient grains with a multitude of advantages for fostering sustainable food systems.
