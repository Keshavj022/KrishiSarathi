 Additionally, lengthy publication lists may inadvertently lower journal rankings. Understanding that impact factor calculations hinge on total citation counts in the numerator and the total number of papers published annually in the denominator, the key to mastering impact factor lies in a simple mantra: publish select papers, focusing on rapidly evolving fields, to enhance impact factor and ensure optimal visibility and recognition. In an editorâ€™s journey, the impact factor is and will always be (being too conservative) a constant companion and so will be the pressure to spew a respectable figure. The discussion on citations and impact factors is endless, yet, amidst this, journal editors will always be the ones grappling with the impact factor's implications. It is we who stands at the crossroads, entrusted with charting a course that balances the demands of impact with the commitment to scholarly discovery. Best of luck to all my fellow Editors-in-Chief as we continue this journey together.
