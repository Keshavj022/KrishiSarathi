67 million ha and thereby showing the availability of at least 1,500 ha of water area for installation cages by taking only 0.1% of the available water area. Surveys in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha and Jharkhand showed that an entrepreneur/fisherman could earn a net return of Rs. 60,000-1,50,000 cage-1 year-1. The cage culture technology has been further refined and diversified with GI Model Cage for better adoption and profitability. At present, there are about 20,000 floating cages in place producing over 50,000 tons of fish and generating employment of 0.8 million man-days year-1. The technology has paved new avenues for entrepreneurship development due to high production and profitability. Wetlands or beels are among the most productive resources offering multiple ecosystem goods and services. The fish yield realized from floodplain wetlands was low, between 50-200 kg ha-1 yr-1 during 1990-2000, due to a lack of scientific management guidelines. With the intervention of ICAR-CIFRI, culture-based fisheries were adopted in various wetlands which resulted in increasing the fish yield to 200-400 kg ha-1 yr-1 in the Eastern and North-Eastern regions. The adoption of ecosystem-based integrated wetland fisheries management and the funding support from the National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB) has resulted in further improvement in fish production and an average fish yield of 400-800 kg ha-1 yr-1 was realized during 2010-20. Recently ICAR-CIFRI has also commercialized CIFRI HDPE Pen and developed policy guidelines for sustainable wetland fisheries management. Table 2.

Coldwater fisheries management The water resources of high-altitude harbour rich Ichthyofaunal diversity, of which the majority are food fishes while others have potential ornamental and sports value.
