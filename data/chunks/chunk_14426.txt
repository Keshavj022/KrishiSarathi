 Also, it is difficult to separate crop fields from forested areas in this region as many fields are inside forest boundaries. Hence, we excluded the eight Northeast states (Sikkim, Assam, Aruna­ chal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and Nagaland) from our study. The decade of 2011–2020 has been very dynamic for India's agri­ cultural sector. India increased its total foodgrain production by about 36 %, from 218.11 Mt in 2010–2011 to 296.65 Mt in 2019–2020. On the other hand, possibly due to the structural transformation of the Indian economy, the agriculture sector's contribution to the country's GDP declined from 16.40 % in 2010–2011 to 14.40 % in 2019–2020 (Agri­ cultural Statistics at a Glance, 2021; Economic Survey 2020–21). Technological advancements, such as the use of combine harvesters, direct seeding machines in rice and wheat, and laser-assisted precision land levellers, were popularized during this period to increase cultiva­ tion efficiency (TERI, 2021). The Ministry of Agriculture developed the National Policy for Management of Crop Residue (NPMCR) in 2014 to tackle agricultural residue burning, followed by the establishment of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2015 to address the issue of residue burning through recycling initiatives and awareness campaigns (Datta et al., 2020). The NGT has banned crop residue burning in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab. Residue burning is also a punish­ able offence under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981 (Kaushal, 2020). However, India has witnessed an abrupt increase in paddy residue burning over the IGP during 2020, which seems to be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic and poor compliance by regulatory authorities (Ravindra et al., 2022). Overall, India's agricultural sector underwent significant changes between 2011 and 2020, which moti­ vates the choice of this decadal period for our analysis. 3. Methods and data 3.1. Agricultural activity data Crop statistics were obtained from the Crop Production Statistics Information System (https://www.aps.dac.gov.in) from 2011 to 2020. The Government of India (GoI) portal provides district-wise crop statistics for five cropping seasons: Kharif, Rabi, Summer, Autumn and Winter. The statistical data includes area under cultivation, production and yield information for crops cultivated across India during each of the respective seasons. Not every crop's residue is burned, so we selected crops with CRB potential based on IPCC recommendations, available literature and ground surveys (IPCC, 1996; Jain et al., 2014; Sahai et al., 2011; Venkatramanan et al., 2021). Seven crops – wheat, rice, sugar­ cane, maize, jute, groundnut and cotton – were identified as significant CRB contributors based on their high production potential, residue-to- crop ratio, and the lack of other cost-effective residue management options.
