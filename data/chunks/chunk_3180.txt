 Exotic and indigenous materials are being regularly screened against important pests and diseases under artificial conditions or at hot spots. It has resulted in identification of sources of resistance to specific diseases and pests. Many of these materials have been used for developing maize cultivars resistant to diseases and pests. Chemical and biological control measures have been devised to combat pests and diseases.
