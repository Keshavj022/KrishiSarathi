 The availability of accurate price and other market information helps to reduce risks and transaction costs and enables market participants to plan and coordinate more effectively their production and trading activities. Although market information has public good elements, most of the efforts to develop public sector market information systems have failed, as most systems have lacked commercial utility and have been unsustainable.  Benefits of well-coordinated supply chains derive from stable markets that can result in greater profitability and employment. Supply chain coordination can:  Provide access to new market outlets and thus increase producers’ ability to match production and demand.  Provide access for producers and small-scale enterprises to information on technology, financing, and market requirements for qualities and quantities.  Better control product quality and safety through tracking, tracing, and certification.  Share risks among chain partners, especially for large investments.  Reduce lead-time and losses of perishable products through joint planning and coordination of supply.  Provide a means to pool production and thus develop economies of scale.  Increase employment from enhanced participation in value-adding activities.
