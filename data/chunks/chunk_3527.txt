 Thereby, it was thought that if Banaskantha district of Gujarat can flourish by adopting potato crop, why not Bikaner district of Rajasthan with similar abiotic situations? ICAR-Central Institute for Arid Horticulture, Bikaner and ICAR-Central Potato Research Institute, Shimla has made systematic efforts to introduce potato crop in Thar Deserts of Rajasthan and to assess their suitability in sandy soils of Thar Desert under drip and sprinkler system of irrigation. Proper management of soil moisture in sandy soil is a crucial factor in potato cultivation, as moisture holding capacity of sandy soil is very poor, besides poor fertility status. Thereafter, a series of experimentations were conducted including varietal screening, standardization of sowing time, irrigation management, fertilizer application, etc. Considering above in view, the technology of potato cultivation in hot arid region was standardized and several demonstrations were taken on farmer’s fields for their quick dissemination and adoption by the farming community. Performance of potato varieties The performance of potato varieties under microsprinkler and drip system of irrigation in the arid region (Table 1). The tuber yield is expressed on pooled basis and economics was calculated on prevailing input and output cost in local market. In general, tuber yield under microsprinkler system was more than drip system of irrigation in arid region. Among different varieties, the highest tuber yield was recorded in Kufri Chipsona-4 (534.8 q/ha) followed by Kufri Frysona (479.7 q/ha), Kufri Jyoti (465.1 q/ha), Kufri Garima (430.9 q/ha), Kufri Surya (398.6 q/ha) and Kufri Khyati (387.6 q/ha) Table 1.
