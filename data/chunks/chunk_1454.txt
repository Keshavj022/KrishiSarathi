 Overall, the jalkund technology plays a vital role in the livelihood improvement of the hill farm households by providing water, especially during the post-rainy season. CONCLUSION A Jalkund, scientifically designed to store a significant volume of rainwater, could sustain irrigation for a 450 m2 cultivated area. With this supplementary irrigation, farmers were able to grow high-value vegetables and meet the water needs of pig and poultry farming during the off-season. This water source was crucial for crop cultivation, enabling the production of substantial quantities of vegetables. Additionally, pig farming, a primary livelihood for many Meghalaya farm households, benefitted from the water stored in Jalkund during dry periods. The water also supported other farm activities, contributing to the overall farm income and enhancing livelihood sustainability. The average total farm income saw a significant increase, with Jalkund playing a vital role in reducing off-season migration by creating employment opportunities. Therefore, implementing and promoting water storage systems like Jalkund can significantly enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability by providing a reliable water source for irrigation and livestock during dry periods, helping farmers cultivate high-value crops, improving farm income, and reducing dependency on seasonal rainfall. Additionally, developing integrated farm support programs that include water storage solutions, training on high-value vegetable cultivation, and livestock management can lead to substantial economic benefits for farmers, increasing farm income and productivity, generating employment, reducing off-season migration, and contributing to overall rural development and stability. *Corresponding author email: chikkathimme.hr@icar.gov.in Table 1.
