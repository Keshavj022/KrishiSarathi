 Since it is mainly in large size tubers, cracking loss can be reduced to minimum by reducing fertilizer doses or haulm cutting at an early date say at 70 days stage thus not allowing the tubers to become very large. Here, rottage was mainly due to soft rot development in deeply cracked tubers. Rodent and cutworm damage was same as in Kufri Pukhraj. Yield After thorough sorting, the actual healthy tuber yields, losses due to individual factors and possible yields without losses are given in Table 1. Findings of this field trial revealed that even after losses due to several factors, the yields of healthy produce was quite encouraging viz. 13.80 t/acre in Kufri Pukhraj and 9.24 t/acre in Kufri Jyoti with average yield of 11.62 t/acre in two varieties. It is clear that the factors causing losses are such which can be controlled to great extent. The yields thus can be increased up to 17 t/acre in Kufri Pukhraj and 12 t/acre in Kufri Jyoti. In case of farmer’s plot, harvesting was done in parts and completed on 1st March 2021. Total production was 1900 kg (38 bags of 50 kg each) from 0.5 acre area. Thus the yield was 3.8 t/acre. Future scope This trial should be repeated in larger plot (about 3 acre) and preferably at a place where mechanized farming can be done. Also effect of lime application to increase soil pH should be studied. Soil is to be tested not only for the freedom from Ralstonia solanacearum but also for nutrients availability to decide upon the optimum doses of fertilizers to be applied. Also, the farmer should grow the same varieties (procured from local sources) as being grown by UTIPL for better comparison. SUMMARY Assam is among the top 10 potato producing states of India but yields are very low as compared to national average due to several constraints. Utkal Tubers India Private Limited, Bengaluru conducted a trial in a farmer’s field in Assam with its seed and technology during 2020- 21. Average yields of two varieties (Kufri Pukhraj and Kufri Jyoti) was 11.62t/acre (28.70t/ha) and that of farmer’s local variety and traditional method, it was 3.8 t/acre (9.39 t/ha). In UTIPL’s case, yield is 3 times more than farmer’s own case and higher than national average with further scope to increase it to about 4 times of farmer’s yield. The study shows that there is tremendous scope for improving the yields in Assam.
