 The energy necessary for soaking was evaluated as the heat required to bring the soaking water to the desired temperature from its ambient temperature. The steaming energy was also measured as the heat gained by the paddy’s dry mass and the moisture gained by the paddy grains. Selecting a pressure parboiling system instead of a traditional hot soaking approach will increase energy consumption [39]. Table 2. Several parboiling systems and energy consumption.

(2006) evaluated energy consumption utilizing rice husk as fuel in direct combustion systems for total parboiling (pre-steaming and steaming) [40]. They reported 2583, 2758, and 1659 MJ/t for the vessel, small-boiler, and medium-boiler processes, respectively. Combining processing techniques has been suggested as an ap- proach to reduce energy use. They studied the cost and energy consumption of a regional parboiler for rice. The rice produced by the local boiler had a high market value, but its energy consumption was extremely high. Work on reducing parboiled rice processing energy was also conducted by Bualuang et al. (2013), who compared hot air and infrared drying of parboiled rice and discovered that drying energy consumption could be reduced by 4.6 times when infrared drying is combined with hot air [41]. However, this technique decreased the quality of the ﬁnal product due to the yellowing of the rice. Apart from that, tempering rice during drying also reduced energy during rice processing. Golmohammadi et al. (2015), who studied the effect of intermittent tempering on rice, discovered that tempering reduces breakage and drastically cuts energy consumption [42].
