Higher education in agricultural sciences should be treated at par with education in other faculties. Agricultural scientists in non-teaching institutions engaged in research and education should also be treated at the same level as was done in 1998. The points were noted. [Action: ADG (EQR)] Agenda 11.10: Pay and Allowance of HoDs and management positions IARI, New Delhi presented the agenda. The positions of Dean, Director (Res.), Director (Extn.) and Head of Departments are senior posts involving higher responsibility and higher eligibility criteria for recruitment than Principal Scientists and Professors. Presently, they have been placed in PB-4 with Grade Pay of Rs.10, 000 with no difference. UGC pay package has provision of Grade Pay of Rs.12,000 for 10% Professors and Grade Pay of Rs.12,000 and additional allowance of Rs.3,000 pm for Deans and equivalent. It is proposed that this system may be adopted in ICAR and SAUs, to give Grade Pay of Rs.12, 000 to Heads of Departments and Grade Pay of Rs.12, 000 and allowance of Rs.3, 000 to Deans, Director (Res.), Director (Extn.) etc. This can bring in the desired hierarchy and better accountability.
