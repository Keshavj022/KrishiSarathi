 The overall conception rate with sex-sorted semen in the field was 27.22 % (49/180), which was lower than the conventional semen at 44.17% (106/240). Sahiwal calf born to Frieswal recipient of Sahiwal breed were frozen, and 11,520 doses were utilized for breeding. Genetic improvement of crossbred cattle under field conditions: Through the interventions of Field Progeny Testing programme, the average first lactation 305-day milk yield in adopted villages increased by 76.29% in KVASU, Trichur; 43.80% at GADVASU, Ludhiana; 21.40% at BAIF, Pune and 44.30% at GBPUA&T, Pantnagar units. Similarly, age at first calving of Frieswal progenies had reduced by 13.80% in KVASU, Trichur; 19.80% at GADVASU, Ludhiana; 1.60% at BAIF, Pune and 12.84% at GBPUA&T, Pantnagar. Buffalo OPU-IVF success and establishment of center of excellence at ICAR-CIRB, Hisar: ICAR-Central Institute for Research on Buffaloes (ICAR-CIRB) in Hisar had successfully generated a male buffalo calf named ‘Veer Gaurav’ utilizing the cutting-edge Ovum Pick up and in-vitro Embryo Production (OPU-IVEP) technology. This achievement involved the utilization of semen from a cloned bull known as ‘Hisar Gaurav’ and an elite female buffalo. OPU-IVEP technology represents a highly advanced reproductive method that facilitates the rapid multiplication of superior female germplasm. This ground-breaking technique enables a substantial GANGA: India’s first cloned cow belonging to Gir breed On 16th March 2023, India’s first cloned cow (named Ganga) was born, showcasing the feasibility of cattle cloning in India. Gir cattle, known for their hardiness and disease resistance, are popular globally. This achievement opens new avenues for India’s dairy sector, offering advanced reproductive technologies to produce high-quality indigenous dairy animals. Raj-Himani: India’s First horse foal produced through frozen semen and embryo transfer Through embryo transfer, a horse foal was produced using frozen semen technology and embryo transfer technology. A healthy female foal was born on 4th October 2023. The weight of the foal at birth was 35 kg. Official release of cloned cow–Ganga by the Hon’ble President of India in presence of Hon’ble Union Minister of Agriculture and Secretary (DARE) and DG (ICAR) All India Coordinated Research Project on Cattle Genetic improvement of indigenous cattle breeds through progeny testing: A total of 26,280 semen doses were produced from the second (500), third (2,460), fourth (17,145) and fifth (6,175) set of Gir bulls. A total of 16,820 frozen semen doses of Kankarej were produced from 9 bulls of fifth set, and 11,095 doses were utilized for insemination. A total of 36,270 doses ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 47 LIVESTOCK IMPROVEMENT increase in the number of progenies produced by an elite female animal over its lifetime, with the potential to yield between 18 and 24 calves from an elite bovine female in a single year.
