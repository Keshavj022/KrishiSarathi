 The pits must be filled to the height of about 2-5 cm above the ground level with the mixture of well rotten farmyard manure, silt and top soil in equal proportions. Irrigation is then applied thoroughly, so that the loose soil settles down properly. Summary The widespread nutrient deficiencies can be managed with the application of the recommended dose of fertilizers that will be helpful in realizing higher litchi production in the country.

It is also called as Queen of Kitchen due to in unique characters like aroma, flavor, and taste. It is widely used throughout the year in curry preparation and in the form of processed foods. India is one of the major onions producing country. The total onion production of India is 228.19 lakh tonnes out of which share of kharif onion is 48.41 lakh tonnes, late kharif onion 21.50 and rabi onion 158.28 lakh tonnes. The major onion producing states are Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Bihar, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh in the country. These states account for almost 90% of the total onion production in the country. Maharashtra ranks first in onion production (8047 thousands tonnes) with a share of 35.26% in 2018-19. In India there are several factors like biotic (Insect pests and diseases) and physiological constraints which affect the yield of onion adversely and reduce productivity. O nion maggot (Delia antiqua; Anthomiidae: Diptera), which is one of the major constraints in the onion production causes rotting of the onion stem in the field and secondary storage, rots in storage leading to heavy losses. Biology of onion maggot Egg: The onion fly deposits white elongated eggs of about 1.25 mm in length on the soil near the stem, occasionally on the young leaves and neck of the onion plant. Eggs hatch in 2-3 days. Maggot: The legless maggots are tapered, creamy-white in colour and reach a length of about 8 mm.
