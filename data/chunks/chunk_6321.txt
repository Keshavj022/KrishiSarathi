 In the Cryogenebank, 378 accessions of seeds and pollen genomic resources of different crop species were successfully cryopreserved, making the total collection of 12,858 accessions belonging to 885 species, besides 2,194 genomic resources. I visited the National GeneBank and in vitro culture facility of ICAR-NBPGR on 14 August , 2023 and interacted with the scientists. A total of 29,706 accessions of various agri-horticultural crops comprising chickpea (5,084), linseed (2,576), wheat (2,534), chilli (1,100), wild Cicer (513), rapeseed and mustard (402), maize (244), yard long bean (210), and other crops (572) were characterized/evaluated for various traits. Core set was developed in linseed comprising 259 accessions. Unique accessions such as pea germplasm (IC220286) with waxiness, prolific maize accessions (KG/VK/SKT-222), pre-harvest sprouting tolerant blackgram accessions (IC485425 and IC250220), chilli accession (EC769427) with 12 flowers per inflorescence were identified. National Agriculturally Important Microbial Culture Collection (NAIMCC) currently holds 7,866 microbial accessions, which include fungi (4,339), bacteria and actinomycetes (3,161), and cyanobacteria (366). The culture collection has received 14 new microbial genera.ICAR-NBAIR Museum has been designated by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Climate Change as the “National Repository” under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 for agriculturally important insects, mites and spiders. The National Insect Museum now holds around 2.40 lakh specimens with addition of 4,786 insect specimens. A total of 1,053 germplasms of different horticultural crops including fruit crops (248), flowers and other ornamental plants (271), vegetables (525) and medicinal and aromatic plants (38) were collected. In addition to the above, a total of 90 accessions of vegetable germplasm (cultivated and wild relatives of Luffa sp, Abelmoschus sp, Trichosanthes sp and Cucumis spp) were collected OVERVIEW ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 3 from the Sundargarh district of Odisha. In addition to the cultivated germplasm, a total of 83 germplasms of vegetables belonging to 42 species including 30 species of wild relatives were collected. Herbarium specimens (20) were also deposited in National Herbarium of Cultivated Plants (NHCP), ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi. A total of 1,081 location specific collections of mushroom strains were also collected, of which 333 specimens/cultures were deposited at the ICAR-DMR Gene Bank with passport data and accession numbers were given to 92 cultures. A total of 15 germplasms have been registered at ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi for different unique traits in fruits, vegetables, flowers and medicinal and aromatic plants. Ten registered breeds of livestock were Gazette notified.
