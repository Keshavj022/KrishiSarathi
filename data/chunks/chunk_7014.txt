 Genetic resources: About 25 explorations were carried out and 1,409 accessions (comprising 772 cultivated and 637 wild) were collected from Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. Germplasm accessions were found in 45% in wild species/CWR. Germplasm included to the National Genebank for long-term storage comprised 8,622 accessions of orthodox seed species and till date the base collection of National Genebank has a total of 4,56,568 accessions. In the cryogenebank, 237 accessions of seeds and pollen genomic resources of different crop species were successfully cryopreserved, making overall collection of 12,076 accessions. A total of 41,490 samples of trait specific accessions were imported from 36 countries. Screening against biotic and abiotic stresses in different crops was carried out in 8,500 and 9,215 accessions, respectively. Biochemical evaluation of 6,580 accessions was undertaken in different crops for oil content, protein, sugar, amino acids, antioxidants and active principles. About 1,22,736 imported samples were processed for quarantine clearance. The total collection in National Genomic Resource Repository (NGRR) is 9,094 from 46 species. The whole genome sequence of cardamom variety Njallani Green Gold has been assembled at a N50 of ~151 kb with 72% BUSCO completeness. On fruits, germplasm such as banana (18), citrus (5), guava (3), mango (30), jamun (1), rose apple (5), jackfruit (40), pine apple (7), avocado (53) and one each in acid lime, ber, custard apple, guava, wood apple were collected. In plantation crops, a total of three new germplasm accessions of areca nut were collected. In vegetable, germplasm in various crops such as chilli (24), brinjal (3), watermelon (3), muskmelon (5), okra (27), Dolichos bean (17), onion (3), radish (10), bitter gourd (6), ridge gourd (3), cucumber (60), cluster bean (2), bottle gourd (8), bell pepper (16), drumstick (77), curry leaf (17), summer squash (33), amaranth (9) were collected. In flowers, germplasm in various crops such as tuberose (1), gladiolus (12), gerbera (16), dahlia (30); and in medicinal plants germplasm in crops such as gudmar Gymnema sylvestre (31), brahmi Bacopa monnieri (71), bhringaraj Eclipta alba (53) and mushroom (2) were collected. In livestock, registered breeds of Dharwadi and Manda buffalo; and Rajapalayam, Chippiparia and Mudhol Hound dog were gazette notified by the Government of India. Monyul cattle of Tawang and West Kameng districts of Arunachal Pradesh was characterized. Monyul cattle are reared for milk, manure and draught. Multivariate analysis was conducted for different biometric traits of 3,282 cattle of 21 native cattle breeds/ populations of the country.
