 ANIMAL BREEDING Producing outstanding bulls : In a collaborative programme between the ICAR and Military Farms, Meerut, 3/8 elite crossbred cows are impregnated with imported frozen semen of HOLSTEIN FRIESIAN with a sire index of 10,000 litres for producing outstanding bulls. The bulls after progeny test are used in genetic improvement of cattle nation-wide Selection of animals for higher productivity has been practised from the days of Matsya Purana, which educates on the criteria for selection of a bull. Such a long and historical association with the art of breeding and raising of animals in widely varying agro-ecologies has resulted in the origin and development of several species and breed types leading to a vast diversity in our livestock and poultry genetic resources over the years. INDIGENOUS ANIMAL GENETIC RESOURCES Our country has the world’s best breeds of dairy buffaloes MURRAH, NILI RAVI, SURTI, JAFFARABADI and BHADAWARI; draught cattle ONGOLE, HARIANA, KANKREJ, KANGAYAM, NAGORI; carpet-wool sheep MAGRA, CHOKLA, and goats JAMUNAPARI and BEETAL. Better adapted to adverse tropical conditions of heat and humidity, our livestock is resistant to many tropical diseases compared with livestock of the temperate climate. The country has also anumber of rare species of Yak, Mithun, pigmy hog and wild buffaloes, including arni, the ancestor of the modern-day buffaloes.

The National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources in collaboration with respective institutes, State animal husbandry departments and the SAUs has developed programmes for their evaluation, characterization, conservation and improvement. Work on evaluation and characterization of cattle HARIANA and RATHI, buffalo BHADAWARI; sheep MALPURA and CHOKLA; Yak and Mithun is in progress. A number of data bases have been developed and linked for inflow of information. << aA eae CHE ) hh Me ph RB 2 7 8 9 10 } fh ng an d i h ah fh Nh O46 ® 6 7 8 2 13 4 15 N Oh af ah fn , ae aA "7 ; “ ) 10 TT 2 13 h aa aw Aa a 0 Pr no an a0 2 e ee soa 1 15 rr 17 rr) : a a “fo - 4 aa on OY) aa 23 r aa am aa eal |? 20 21 22 ' as = = = h na. ae (.
