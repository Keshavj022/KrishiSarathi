 This issue is not confined to India alone but affects vegetable production globally, posing a challenge to food security. Emission of greenhouse gases: Various gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide, are among the primary contributors to global warming, negatively impacting the quality and productivity of vegetable crops. The release of greenhouse gases from sources like industry, agriculture and deforestation plays a significant role in the recent changes in the Earth’s climate. Rising temperatures caused by global warming have detrimental effects on agriculture and vegetable crops in particular. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has experienced a substantial increase, rising from 280 parts per million (ppm) during pre- industrial times to 458 ppm in 2023. Similarly, other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide have significantly increased global atmospheric concentrations. The continuous escalation of greenhouse gas emissions has resulted in a 0.74°C increase in global temperatures over the past century, and these emissions are projected to continue rising in the future. Consequently, the higher global temperatures will necessitate a greater demand for vegetable crop varieties that are adaptable to higher temperatures. Way forward and adaptations to climate change Development of resilient crop varieties and hybrids: Efforts are being made to create plant varieties that can withstand adverse climate conditions. These varieties are designed to tolerate extreme temperatures, drought, floods and other climate-related stresses. Adoption of climate-resilient technologies: Various technological advancements are being implemented to mitigate the impact of climate change on agriculture. This includes changing the timing of sowing to align with favourable climate conditions, using protected cultivation techniques to shield crops from harsh weather, employing drip irrigation systems for efficient water use, implementing soil and moisture conservation practices, managing fertilizers through fertigation and utilizing weather-based agricultural advisory services. These measures aim to enhance productivity while minimizing the impact of climate variability. Biotechnological approaches for stress tolerance: Biotechnology plays a crucial role in developing crops with enhanced tolerance to multiple stresses. Through genetic engineering and other biotechnological methods, scientists are working on creating plants that can better withstand adverse environmental conditions, such as heat, drought, salinity and pests.
