Regional Sustainability (2024) 5(2) 100144 12 In contrast, in terms of irrigation intensity, the results outlined in Table S3 affirmed the significant differences among cluster 1 and clusters 2 and 3 (P-values of 0.001 and 0.000, respectively) during 2018–2019. Cluster 2 exhibited no statistically significant difference from cluster 3 (P=0.838). The η² was calculated to be 0.627, indicating that 62.70% of the variation was associated with irrigation intensity. Figures 5 and 6 depicted the dendrogram and district classifications based on the HCA during 2004–2005 and 2018–2019. Fig. 5.
