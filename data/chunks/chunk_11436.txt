Rani-fed Condition: HI1612; K1317; HD3171 & K8027. Sowing time: Wheat is generally sown on timely irrigated condition 1st week of October, timely unirrigated condition 2nd week of November and Late irrigated condition 1st week of December and Rainfed condition last week October to 1st week November. Requirement of seed: for timely sowing is 100 kg/ha and for late sowing of wheat 125 kg/ha for getting optimum plant population. Seed treatment should be done with carbendazim @ 2.0g/kg seed. Sowing should be done in lines sowing at a spacing of 20-22 cm x 10 cm. Application of fertilizer: In timely irrigated condition 150:60:40 Kg/ha (NPK), in late irrigated condition 90:30:20 Kg/ha (NPK) should be applied. Half of N and entire dose of P & K should be given at the time of sowing and remaining N in two equal doses at 21 DAS and 45 DAS, respectively. About 5 to 10 tonnes of FYM or compost should be applied per hectare at the time of land preparation. Irrigation: Proper irrigation is most essential for wheat. Six irrigations at 20-25 DAS (crown root initiation stage), 40-45 DAS (tillering stage), 70-75 DAS (late jointing stage), 90-95 DAS (flowering stage) and 110-105 DAS (milking stage).
