 Lastly, for the sensitivity analysis of irrigation costs, we assessed how the profitability of irrigation-based intensification changed with typical pumping costs. We used irrigation cost values based on fieldwork data and secondary literature and included (rented) large diesel pumps, small diesel pumps, (rented) electric pumps, and fully subsidized irrigation (Foster et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2009; Urfels et al., 2020). We assumed Fig. 1. Map of study location and survey data points. A. Urfels et al. Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103618 5 an irrigation of 60 mm, 3.59 $PPP/l of fuel, 1.21 $PPP/unit of elec­ tricity; Large pumps: 1.25 l/h fuel consumption and 12 l/s discharge; Small pumps: 0.5 l/h fuel consumption and 10 l/s discharge; Electric: 1 unit/h energy consumption and 8 l/s discharge. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Intensification Benefit Index distribution and the median household The households in our dataset had a very small median IBI value of 0.02 cents per dollar−1 with a strongly right-skewed distribution (see Table 1 for crop-wise figures). This means that a household with the median IBI value with crop production profits of PPP$ 1000 ha−1 year−1 would earn PPP$ 0.20 day−1. A profit of 9500 PPP$ ha−1 year−1 would be required to provide the PPP$1.90 day−1 needed to move above the international poverty line (World Bank, 2017). The median number of household members in our dataset was 7.8 with 0.54 ha for a house­ hold’s landholding (see Table 1 for crop-wise figures). To contextualize, the median IBI value of 0.02 cents dollar−1 may represent a household with 0.64 ha of land and 8 persons, 0.32 ha of land and 4 persons or, more generally, a land per capita ratio of 0.08 ha person−1. To understand the IBI logic, consider the following thought experi­ ments: If the landholding of a household would increase (e.g., double due to land purchases) the cropping system profitability requirements for reaching the poverty line would be cut in half (4500 PPP$ ha−1 year−1). Similarly, as the number of household members decreases, IBI values increase as relatively more land is available per person. For example, if a household member left the household (e.g., young adults to pursue work opportunities elsewhere) this would also decrease the profit requirements to lift the farming household above the poverty line (but may impose additional labor costs that might constrain achieve­ ment of that profit). In addition, productivity and management of small farms might be further constrained by other factors such as machinery and labor availability even if irrigation intensity is increased (Urfels et al., 2021). Consequently, irrigation-led intensification is likely to benefit from delineating areas where substantial accompanying investments are required to lift other production constraints before the benefits of irri­ gation could materialize.
