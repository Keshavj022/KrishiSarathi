EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN IN DIFFERENT ENTERPRISES DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2002–2003 178 hazards reported by the women involved in various post-harvest operations like transporting, threshing, crop drying, shelling, parboiling, and storage are headache, injury, eye irritation, skin infection, and pain. Women involved in various livestock activities like feeding of animals, cleaning of shed, collection of fodder, milking, and chaff cutting, reported pain in waist and hand more frequently. In the Mission Mode Project on ‘Empowerment of women in agriculture’, 540 farmwomen were grouped into 18 experimental Self-Help Groups (SHGs). For each SHG, 2 link workers were selected for leading a group of 15 farm women. These link workers were trained on organizing training on different entrepreneurial activities like pisciculture, mushroom production, nursery raising and vegetable production, floriculture, processing of milk/milk products, agro-processing, coir work, and vermi composting. During the year, training was imparted to six groups, besides developing training materials like folders, video cassettes/multi media CD on the use of technologies for reduction of drudgery in transplanting, sowing, weeding and parboiling. The NRCWA organized 30 training programmes for the benefit of 887 farm- women.
