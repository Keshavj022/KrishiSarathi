 This year, ‘The Global Potato Conclave’ is being held during 28–31 January 2020, at Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India, to highlight achievements and opportunities in the area of potato research, trade and industry, and value chain management. This mega event is having three equally important components; (i) The Potato Conference, (ii) The AgriExpo and (iii) The Potato Field Day. The GPC 2020 will provide an opportunity for researchers to present their work and share their knowledge with national and international scientists and academicians; to trade and industries to showcase their products/technologies/implements etc. and to the farming communities about the latest potato technologies related to various components of potato value chain including seed, production technology, storage, marketing, value-addition etc. It is expected that more than 5,000 farmers, representatives from trade and industries, researchers, officials from various government organizations, students etc. will be participating in this mega event. I feel highly encouraged and motivated by the overwhelming response from potato growers, and the world leaders in potato research, technology, trade and the policy makers. I extend a warm invitation to one and all to participate in this global event and add value to the three dimensions of potato i.e. Farming, Health and Business. You can contribute as researcher through lead papers, oral/ poster presentation. If you deal with any aspect of trade in potato you can demonstrate/ display your products/ technologies. As industry you can showcase your tools/ implements/ any other relevant process or product. Field Day component of this conclave will provide a platform for live demonstrations of technologies/varieties/tools or implements etc. which is expected to be a very effective demonstration, meant for developers as well as the end-user. I do hope that your participation in the Conclave will help in devising a system-based roadmap for enhancing the role of potato in making our world a better one for all. Being at the venue of the Conclave will itself have the feel of our rich cultural heritage.

This New World crop was originally domesticated about 8,000 years ago by communities of hunters and gatherers in the Andes mountain range of South America, on the border between Bolivia and Peru. It was discovered and taken out of South America by the Spanish conquistadores who invaded Peru between 1532 and 1572 and caused the mass massacare of at least half of her population.
