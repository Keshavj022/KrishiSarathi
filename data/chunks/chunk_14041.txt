 Table 1 shows that the genome of the isolate “Klebsiella aerogenes ” consists of 5,071,737 paired end reads, and the chromosomal DNA has 1,505,053,235 number of bases. The length of consensus sequence was found to be 5.27 Mb, with a GC content of 50.64%. After mapping to A. Mann, S. Malik and J.S.

Table 2 shows the details of the Single Nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Insertion- Deletions (InDels) obtained upon comparison of the genome of Klebsiella aerogenes isolated in the present study with the reference genome. The mpileup utility of SAM tools (v 0.1.18) was used to identify the SNPs and InDels from the sorted BAM ﬁle of each of the mappings (Ex- cel sheet 1). The variants were ﬁltered based on a minimum read depth of 15, and a quality threshold of 25. The identiﬁed variants were annotated using BED tools, an intersect tool. A to- tal of 53,604 SNPs were obtained, among which 52,092 were observed to be homozygous SNPs, whereas 1,512 were heterozygous SNPs. Among the annotated SNPs, 48,654 were genic SNPs and 4,950 were intergenic SNPs. The total number of InDels identiﬁed was 222, among which 195 were homozygous InDels, and 27 were heterozygous InDels. Among the annotated InDels, 50 were genic InDels and 172 were intergenic InDels. Fig. 2 shows the presence of all the important genes found in this genome. The pie chart was developed by rapid annotation using subsystem technology toolkit (RASTtk) [8] (rast.nmpdr.org) and has been viewed in SEED server ( https://pubseed.theseed.org/ ) [8] . A total number of 4749 coding sequences were observed to be present in the subsystem. The bar chart on the left-hand side of the ﬁgure shows the subsystems coverage in percentage (blue bar corresponds to the percentage of proteins not in the subsystem, and the green one represents the percentage of proteins in the subsystem). The pie chart to the right shows the distribution of 27 most abun- dant subsystem categories out of a total of 2118 subsystem categories. Excel sheet 1 consists of four sheets, the ﬁrst and the second sheet contain details about all SNPs, about all InDels, respectively. The third excel sheet details information about all genic SNPs, and the fourth one details information about all genic InDels.
