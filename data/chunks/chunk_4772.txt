Polypropylene bags are autoclavable and can be utilized 5-6 times which reduces their cost. Polypropylene bags are transparent and air tight which helps in higher survival and better plant grafts.

The drive to the metering unit is derived from the ground wheel. A shoe-type furrow opener is fitted to the planting frame in front of onion bulb delivery tube. A funnel-shaped box was also fitted at the bottom of the seed delivery tube to prevent spillage of the onion bulb outside the furrow. This ensures an uninterrupted free-fall of the onion bulb from metering disc to furrow. The furrow opener assembly was mounted independent to the planter unit hence it can be positioned as required to ensure proper row spacing. The effective field capacity of the machine was 0.3 ha/h with field efficiency of 75%.

It is native to Southern Africa and holds huge demand in the global flower industry owing to its vibrant colour, prolonged vase life and faster rehydration. As per the First Advance Estimates (2023-24) published by Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer’s welfare, gerbera is cultivated in an area of 5,280 ha with the production of 26,660 MT in India. It is obvious that the food and water demand are increasing exponentially due to the rising population and urbanization. The irrigation water demand has been projected to increase from 688 billion cubic metre in 2010 to 1072 billion cubic metre by 2050.
