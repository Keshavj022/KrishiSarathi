 More than 15 meetings were organized with different stakeholders and now the seed production standards for 47 new crops have been developed after thorough discussion with breeders and Institutes of ICAR and states. The Central Seed Certification Board has approved these standards for adoption by the states and stakeholders. The second volume of ‘Indian Minimum Seed Certification Standard’ published recently contains information on General Seed Certification Standards including field and seed standards for new crops for adoption by the stakeholders for bringing notified varieties of these crops in certified seed and planting material production chain. I am sure that the seed production and seed certification agencies will be benefitted from this publication. The copies are available with Directorate of Knowledge Management in Agriculture at nominal price of `300 per copy. (Dr Suresh K Malhotra) July–August 2023 3 Gangadhara K, Lalu Prasad Yadav, V V Apparao, A K Singh and B D Sharma Research V EGETABLE Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata ssp unguiculata) is a warm season, annual and herbaceous legume known by various names such as black-eye bean, China pea, southern pea and lobia. Nutritionally, cowpea is low in saturated fat and very low in cholesterol and sodium. Cowpea is called as vegetable meat due to high amount of protein in grain with better biological value on dry weight basis. On dry weight basis, cowpea grain contains 23.4% protein, 1.8% fat and 60.3% carbohydrates and it is a rich source of calcium and iron. Striking features of Thar Jyothi It is a photo-insensitive type and high yielding variety of vegetable cowpea. It grows up to 50-56 cm height, having dark green leaves with dark green pods which can be cultivated round the year. It has short stature (bushy growth habit). It is an early flowering and early maturing variety, and takes 40-42 days for first flowering, and 48- 50 days after sowing for first harvesting of fresh tender dark green colour pods. The variety has an average pod length of 25 to 26.50 cm with pod girth of 2.5 cm and pod weight of 9.65 g in rainfed semi-arid conditions. The total number of pods per plant varies between 120-150 and an average yield of 1.5 to 2.0 kg/plant of fresh pods was obtained with yield potential of 20-25 t/ha. Thar Jyothi is rich in nutritional value in terms of proteins (4.82 g/100 g), vitamin-C (55.8 mg/100 g), calcium (460.5 mg/100 g), magnesium (2 5 2.12 mg/100 g), phosphorus (10 5.6 4 mg/100 g), sodium ( 2 0 . 3 m g /10 0 g ) , potassium (206.5 mg/100 g), iron (5.2 mg/100 g). It contains antioxidants like phenols (2.435 mg/g) and total antioxidant activity (14.0µ.moltrolox.equi./g). The variety performs well under rainfed semi-arid conditions and has exhibited tolerance to cowpea mosaic virus and rust diseases under rainfed semi-arid conditions.
