Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are the major states where both kharif and rabi sorghums are cultivated. Sorghum improvement till 1960s focused on selections from local land races, which were tall with low harvest index, photosensitive, late maturing after seize of monsoon and with localized adaptation. With the launching of Accelerated Hybrid Sorghum Project through Rockfeller Foundation a wide range of germplasm was made available in India. This led to significant improvement principally through manipulation of plant height and maturity. Major achievement of Accelerated Hybrid Sorghum Project was the availability of male sterile (MS) lines from the USA and diverse germplasm from Africa and South East Asia. With the release of CSH 1, the first commercial hybrid in 1964, sorghum became the second crop after maize in developing high yielding hybrids using cytoplasmic-genetic male sterility system and variety CSH 1 gained much popularity among farmers.
