 Technical Report on Communication technologies in M2M/ loT domain? was released in 2017. This report covers Cellular Technologies (2G, 3G, 4G i.e. up to LTE 3GPP Release 14), Low power wireless communication technologies (NFC, RFID, Bluetooth, ZigBee etc.), Low power wide area network technologies (LPWAN -— cellular/ non-cellular), Wi-Fi [IEEE 802.11 a, b, g, n, ac], DSRC (802.11p), wire line (PLC, DSL, FTTH) etc and the related use cases. * https://tec.gov.in/pdf/M2M/Communication%20Technologies%20in%201oT%20domain.pdf TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 6 Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report TEC 31228:2024 Telecommunication Engineering Centre 7 Due to advancement in technology, further study was done and the Technical Report on Emerging Communication Technologies and Use cases in IoT domain3 was released in November 2021. This report covers 5G, Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E, WiFi HaLow, Bluetooth Mesh and some important use cases such as Intelligent transport system (Connected vehicles, C-V2X etc.), Private Industrial Network (Smart factories, Industry 4.0), Smart homes etc. Figure 5 below illustrates the connectivity of IoT devices with the headend system/ cloud directly or through IoT Gateway on various communication technologies. (Source: Keysight technologies) Figure 5: IoT Architecture IoT devices typically utilize wireless communication technologies, although they may also be connected via wireline. Some of the examples of the IoT devices may include smart camera, smart watch, smart meters, tracking devices etc. IoT gateways may include POS machines, smart phones, Wi- Fi routers etc. Further, the data collected from IoT devices is transferred to the cloud either directly or through an IoT gateway for storage and analysis purpose, for taking informed decisions. 3https://tec.gov.in/pdf/M2M/Emerging%20Communication%20Technologies%20&%20Use%20Cases%20in%20IoT% 20domain.pdf Revolutionizing Agriculture: The Digital Transformation of Farming Technical Report Due to advancement in technology, further study was done and the Technical Report on Emerging Communication Technologies and Use cases in loT domain? was released in November 2021.
