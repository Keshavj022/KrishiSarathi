 For the first time, recorded catch of marine/deep Genetic Resources icar annual report 2022-23 91 Flathead grey mullet, Mugil cephalus whole genome sequence was found to be of 644 Mb in length in 583 scaffolds with N50 of 28.32 Mb. The genome was predicted to be 96% complete with 27,269 protein-coding genes and 11.72% repetitive elements. sea fish species like Aluterus monoceros, Antennarius indicus, Ariomma indica, Diodon hystrix, Lobotes surinamensis, Nemipterus randalli, Priacanthus prolixus, and Seriolina nigrofasciata in the estuary. Characterization of whole genome assembly: Indian oil sardine, Sardinella longiceps Valenciennes, 1847 whole genome assembly is 1.077 Gb (31.86 Mb scaffold N50) in size with a repeat content of 22.84%. The estimated genome size is 1.118 Gb and the assembly coverage is 96.3%. The sequences were deposited to NCBI, GenBank. Ariosoma albimaculatum Ariosoma maurostigma Actinimenes koyas Ariosoma indicum Sardinella longiceps Circos plot depicting the 24 pseudochromosomes in M. cephalus assembly and their features. Track 1 (outermost) depicts 24 pseudochromosomes; track 2 depicts contig lengths; track 3 shows protein-coding genes; track 4 shows GC content; track 5 (innemost) depicts self synteny in the genome. Shrimp microsporidian, Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP), is causative agent of disease Hepatopancreatic microsporidiasis (HPM) in farmed shrimp. The whole genome of EHP yielded a sequence size of 3.12 Mb (3118664 bp) in 22 contigs with a GC content of 26.36%, longest contig size 8,11,456 bp, N50 value 2,35,882 and N90 value of 1,51,450 bp. The Indian EHP whole genome shared 99.4% genome similarity with the Chinese isolate, 99.5% with Thailand isolate, and 98.8% with the Indonesian isolate. This study reported the whole genome of EHP from India for the first time. Whole genome assembly of Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) Phenotypic variation among Chitala chitala populations from Indian rivers: Chitala chitala (Hamilton 1822) is an economically important food fish species occurring throughout Indian rivers, which also has ornamental value. The phenotypic variance was identified. The significant parameters differentiating specimens from different rivers were linked to dorsal fin origin, the base of the pectoral fin and the perpendicular point on the anal fin from the dorsal fin origin. Variation in the hydrodynamics of the rivers might be possibly affecting the fin kinematics and consequently leading to adaption seen as phenotypic variation. These phenotyping tools have great importance for the scientific management and conservation of species. The species exhibited significant phenotypic plasticity which explicitly indicates the presence of at-least seven different morphotypes of C. chitala in the subpopulations found in different rivers. Use of advanced variable molecular markers in combination with phenotyping tools is highly desirable in future, for documenting diversity in this species.
