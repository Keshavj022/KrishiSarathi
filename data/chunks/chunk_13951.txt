Govern- ments in developing countries have actively promoted GIs for agricultural goods as a tool for rural and regional socio- economic development (van Caenegem & Cleary, 2017). This emphasis on GIs is driven partly by their presumed positive effect on agricultural exports. However, despite their wide- spread use, we have had little empirical evidence on the causal link between GIs and agricultural exports in develop- ing countries. This is mainly due to the unavailability of regional export data for agricultural commodities at a disaggregated level. Additionally, there is also the need for systematic data on product-level GIs for developing coun- tries.1 Through this study, we attempt to ﬁll this gap in the literature by providing the ﬁrst evidence of the effect of GIs on agricultural exports for the full spectrum of agricultural commodities, speciﬁcally within the ambits of a large devel- oping country like India. By increasing the perceived quality of a product, GIs can increase exports at both intensive and extensive margins. For instance, Crozet, Head, and Mayer (2012) ﬁnd that higher quality of champagne for French producers is associ- ated with higher exports, higher prices, and a higher proba- bility of entry into export markets.

(2019), and Sorgho and Larue (2014). Further few case studies examine the impact of GIs on some important agricultural products like Darjeeling Tea (Rao, 2005) and Basmati Rice in India (Jena and Grote, 2012). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iimb.2024.10.003 0970-3896 © 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Indian Institute of Management Bangalore.

Further, GIs can increase exports by increasing physical efﬁciency by standardizing and modernizing the production process (Durand & Fournier, 2017).
