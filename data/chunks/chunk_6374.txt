 41) were selected based on kanamycin selection and healthy green shoots were grafted onto root-stocks to establish mature fertile plants. Targeted mutation of Efl1 gene should result in early flowering chickpea genotypes, that can avoid terminal stress and also the shorter duration chickpea genotypes for rice-fallow ecosystem. Metabolome of Amycolatopsis keratinophila: Analysis of the metabolome of Amycolatopsis keratinophila, a rare actinomycete genus, identified several bioactive metabolites produced by the isolate in the culture supernatant having antibacterial, antifungal, anthelminthic, antitumor and antiviral properties. The isolate also produced gibberellins and siderophores with the potential for plant growth promotion. De novo sequencing of genome of Trichoderma erinaceum (NRRI-T2): The number of unique genes predicted by Glimmer HMM were 18,815. Tandem Repeat Finder identified 5,532 micro/mini satellite loci which is 1.53% of the genome. Protein prediction for the identified genes with Blast2GO Pro version 5.2.5 resulted in 13,877 genes (74%) and 1,219 genes were mapped to proteins of which 62 (5%) were mapped to predicted proteins and rest 95% were annotated. The maximum number of hits were mapped to Trichoderma gamsii (53%) followed by Trichoderma atroviride (25%). Genome editing in rice: Gene editing with CRISPR- Cas9 technology was employed to developed mutants of the Drought and Salt Tolerance (DST) gene, a zinc finger transcription factor, in rice cultivar MTU 1010 during last year. Five different mutants were generated, and from this two SDN1 type mutants free from introduced exogenous DNA were identified. For DBT SOPs for regulatory review of genome edited plants under SDN-1 and SDN-2 categories, data were generated. Exemption of DST mutants from Rules 7-11 of Rules 1989 were obtained from IARI IBSC on 12 April 2023, and was noted in 259th RCGM on 31 May 2023. These two mutants identified produced significantly higher grain yield in Summer 2023 under transgenic field condition in irrigated environment. Two mutants of DST gene free from exogenous introduced DNA are being evaluated in AICRIP 2024. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) markers linked with rancidity in the flours of pearl millet: Twelve diverse cultivars of pearl millet (6 landraces and 6 elite cvs.) were used for the volatile estimation using GC/ MS and PCA based analysis. The abundance of volatile compounds like 2-Propenal, 9, 12- Octadecadienoic acid, Hexadecanoic acid, Dodecane, Hexadecanol, etc. were observed in landraces like Chadhi Bajri, Chanana Bajra-2, Doodhasar Local, Damodhar Bajri, Jafrabadi and Garwal Ki Dhani-3. Similarly, elite cultivars like MPMH-17, PC-701, HHB-67, 86M94, Pusa-1803, and ProAgro 9001 showed abundance of Ethyl propanoate, Ethyl benzene, 9-Octadecenamide, Octadecanoic acid, DST gene edited mutants (D366bp and D2 bp) produce significantly higher grain yield than WT MTU 1010 under irrigated conditions.
