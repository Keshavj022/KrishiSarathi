 Similarly, three years observation at Dharwad revealed that application of FYM @ 20 tonnes/ha + NPK @ 80:60:80 kg/ha + PP chemicals + IIHR microbial consortium @ 12.5 kg/ha produced the maximum yields in coriander-radish sequence with a B:C ratio of 2.88. Hence, the above organic package has been recommended for Agro-climatic Zone-VIII. Three years study in Nagaland on organic production of spinach beet revealed that application of vermicompost 5 tonnes/ha + PSB + Azospirillum (each 5 kg/ha) registered maximum leaf yield (172.83 q/ha) which was at par to application of FYM 20 tonnes/ha + PSB + Azospirillum (each 5 kg/ha). However, maximum net Different stages of rooting of cutting of apple in soilless rooting medium under protected conditions Vegetable specific liquid nutrient formulation ‘Arka Sasya Poshak Ras’ The liquid nutrient formulation (comprising solutions A and B) is a unique balanced blend of the macro (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) and micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, B and Mo). This formulation is suitable for commonly grown vegetables—tomato, chilli, cabbage, zucchini, cucumber, ridge gourd, French bean, peas, cowpea, dolichos bean, etc. and leafy vegetables such as, amaranth, coriander, palak, etc. It is highly suited for cocopeat based cultivation and balcony, terrace gardening, in open or polyhouse conditions. CROP MANAGEMENT ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 83 return (` 2,04,595) and B:C ratio (1:4.35) was recorded with application of FYM 20 tonnes/ha + PSB + Azospirillum (each 5 kg/ha). Hence, application of FYM 20 tonnes/ha + PSB + Azospirillum (each 5 kg/ha) was recommended for organic production of spinach beet (Palak) in Agro-climatic zone III (NEH region). Vegetable based organic farming system: Under organic farming, maximum productivity in terms of wheat- equivalent yield (291.98 q/ha) and net return (`2,82,324/ha) was recorded in cowpea-cauliflower- bottle gourd sequence. Application of FYM @ 25 tonnes/ha increased the organic carbon content of soil by 31.7% over inorganic cultivation with recommended dose of fertilizer. The maximum microbial activity in soil was observed under application of NADEP compost @ 25 tonnes/ha. Integrated weed management in vegetables: Three years study on weed management in okra at Vellanikkara revealed that pre-emergence application of pendimethalin @ 6 ml/l + one hand weeding at 25 days after sowing was suitable for maximum fruit yield of 143.58 q/ha with the B:C ratio of 2.1. Hence this was recommended for weed management in okra in the tropical sub-humid lateritic soils of Agro-climatic Zone VIII. Pre-emergence application of pendimethalin @ 6 ml/l along with one hand weeding gave maximum yield of okra (144.94 q/ha) with B:C ratio of 2.13 in okra cv. Arka Anamika under Nagaland condition. Seed production technology of vegetables: In pumpkin cv. Arka Suryamukhi, physiological maturity of seed was attained due to harvesting of fruits at 45 days after anthesis.
