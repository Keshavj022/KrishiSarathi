 In case of rice, GEB 24 was the first rice variety released through an official breeding programme in 1921. In 1933, Basmati 370 was identified from a large collection of Basmati rice cultivars grown all over the North Western India. An All-India Board of Agriculture was established in 1905 with a view to bring the Provincial governments more in touch with one another and make suitable recommendations to the government. The Indian Agriculture Service was constituted in 1906. The Royal Commission on Agriculture (Linlithgow Commission), which was appointed in 1926, authoritatively reviewed the position of agriculture in India and reported the same in 1928. According to the proposal of the Royal Commission on Agriculture, the Department of Education, Health and Lands of the government set up the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research (now ICAR) on 16 July 1929. Several semi-autonomous Central Commodity Committees were set up by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. The Indian Central Cotton Committee was the first one to be established in 1921 on the recommendation of the Indian Cotton Committee (1917-18). The chief function of the Central Cotton Committee was cotton improvement with special focus on the development of improved methods of growing and marketing cotton. The Committee’s support led to the development of 70 improved varieties and considerably improved fibre quality. IARI became the premier national institute for agricultural research, education and extension in India. After independence in 1947, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) steered agricultural research, education and extension in post-independent India. Intensive efforts of the scientists through innovative breeding programmes and suitable crop husbandry (agronomic) practices, coupled with the conducive policies of the Government, active involvement of extension professionals and farmers resulted in the ‘Green Revolution’ in 1960s thereby ensuring food security to the country. Subsequent achievements in crop improvement and its management are discussed in the subsequent chapters.
