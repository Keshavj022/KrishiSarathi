3 million hectares of the cultivated land is assured of irrigation, expanding at 2.9% a year. The farmer has been provided incentive (credit or subsidy) for adoption of modern devices for efficient irrigation — centrifugal pump, drip, sprinkler and micro-irrigation systems. While the devices are continually improved for performance, the water-balance models are studied for appropriate use of ground- and-surface water. Use of drip for fertigation in fruits and vegetables is being studied. Drainage is equally essential, since high precipitation, over-irrigation and seepage from canals lead to a rise in water table affecting adversely the root growth and ultimately the crop yield. Extra water beyond field capacity may be drained off through surface and sub- surface drainage techniques developed under the AICRP on Agricultural Drainage. The drainage experiments demonstrated on the farmers’ fields in Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Kerala have improved the physical condition of the soil. The crop yield of rice, wheat, soybean and sugarcane has improved as a result.

The draught animals, 73 million in number, generate power equivalent to 18,250 Mw and cultivate about 55% of the total area. Though the population of draught animals is declining, agriculture labour is increasing at a compound rate of 2.1% a year. They numbered 186 million in 1991. Sowing, transplanting, weeding, harvesting and paddy threshing depend on human power. The agricultural engineers have developed efficient hand tools like wheel- hoe weeder, paddy transplanter, hand maize- sheller, manual groundnut decorticator, winnower and cleaner. Mechanical power supports intensive agriculture and agro-processing. From 8,000 tractors being introduced a year in the fifties, 155,000 tractors are being introduced a year in the nineties. At present more than 1.5 million tractors are used in Cultivation of nearly 17% of the cultivated area. Electricity, diesel and engine-operated irrigation pumps are progressively improved upon for efficiency. Improved foot valves and pipes alone have brought in a saving of 30-40% energy. Solar, biogas, producer gas, and windmills are alternative or supplementary sources of energy.
