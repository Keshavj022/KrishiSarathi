 The regulatory hub genes, except acta1, were found to be upregulated in fast-growing table size fish and post-winter fingerling groups. These results provide valuable information about the key genes to be used as biomarkers of growth in breeding programmes and contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways regulating growth, in response to temperature fluctuation and different growth stages. K Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitory bioactive peptides were mined from the muscle proteome of catfish, Clarias magur. Out of total 468 common peptides, 23 peptides showed bioactivity for ACE inhibition. ACE inhibitors help in the reduction of hypertension by effectively reducing vasoconstriction. Traditionally synthesized compounds used for ACE inhibition pose side effects. Moreover, anti-cancer peptides were also retrieved from the muscle proteome. Total 60 peptides showed anti-cancer activity. These anti-cancer bioactive peptides are exhibiting anti-tumour activity by activating apoptosis in mitochondria slaying tumour cells. The fish-derived bioactive peptides can prove to be a natural and less toxic therapeutic source.
