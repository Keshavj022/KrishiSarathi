 More advanced models, like artificial neural networks (ANNs), can handle complex, non- linear relationships, making them well-suited for this task. By training these models on extensive datasets that encompass various environmental conditions and their effects on different produce, stakeholders can accurately predict how long a product will remain marketable. This information allows for better inventory management and more informed decisions regarding transport and storage. CNN-XgBoost approach offers a reliable and efficient method for non-destructive ripening stage classification of bananas. Its ability to perform well with a relatively smaller dataset addresses a significant limitation often encountered in deep learning applications, where large datasets are typically required. The other models that are used for the comparison are k-nearest neighbor (KNN), multilayer perception (MLP), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and AdaBoost. Block-chain for traceability and supply chain transparency in fresh and processed products Traditional traceability systems often suffer from fragmentation, with data stored in various databases and formats, making it challenging to track produce effectively.
