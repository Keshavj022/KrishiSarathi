 This waste can be fed to grower and finisher pig replacement 10% of the concentrate mixer in the daily feed allowances. ¾ Dried cuttla fish bone meal could be used as calcium supplement in the ration for growing pigs replacing calcium carbonate. ¾ Incorporation of coconut oil at 2% level in the ration was found to improve the growth rate and feed conversion efficiency of grower pigs. 14 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Animal Sciences www.icar.org.in All India Coordinated Research Project on Poultry Breeding 1.

Research Achievements: Major Achievements under the Project  Feeding system followed at farm‐gate level documented based on the primary data  Commercialization of area‐specific mineral mixture has been done by NIANP, Bangalore  Mineral mapping of different agro‐climatic zones in the country has been prepared based on micro nutrient status in water, feed, fodder and in animals  Cataloguing of feeds and fodders based on their macro/micro nutrient content has been done for different ago‐eco zones which would help in strategic supplementation of different nutrients at field level  Documented availability and utilization of non‐conventional feed resources and their commercialization.  Unconventional feed resources like cashew apple waste, castor cake, tamarind seed kernel, jack fruit seed and rape seed cake have been evaluated for use an animal feed 16 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Animal Sciences www.icar.org.in All India Coordinated Research Project on Animal Disease Monitoring and Surveillance 1.
