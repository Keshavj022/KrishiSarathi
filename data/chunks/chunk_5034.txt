 The results indicate that application of mustard oil reduced the insect attack in stored pulses. It can also be said that 3 to 5 drops of oil may be applied in pulses.  GRAIN/SEED STORAGE Table 4.

CONCLUSION Perceptible effect of application of mustard oil in controlling storage pests of greengram, blackgram and lentil was observed from the experimental results, thus corroborating the ITK practice. The results, however, are based only 10 experiments in winter and 10 experiments in summer.  GRAIN/SEED STORAGE Code :1464 Title of the ITK :Evaluation of different methods for storing of vegetable seeds Description of the ITK : About 50 to 100 g sinduar leaf powder is mixed with seeds m of blackgram, pigeonpea, chickpea, lathyrus, ridge gourd, lady-finger, barbate etc. are kept with dry sal leaves in a bag like container and hanged in the roof over the chulha in the kitchen. Seeds of tomato, guava, bitter gourd, khira etc are pasted on the wall for storage. Seeds of paddy are kept in bamboo baskets and the mouth is covered by paddy straw and mud. Paddy seeds of the same variety are also stored in the storage bin made of mud in the house over raised platform. Paddy seeds are stored in box made with wood. Seeds of paddy are stored in mora (pura). Mora is made of paddy straw and tied tightly with ropes made of paddy straw. Seeds can be stored for 5_10 years in mora where even rats cannot enter. About 5 to 10g paddy seed is stored in earthen pot. For storing seeds of maize, blackgram, greengram, lathyrus and pigeonpea, 250_500 g powder of sinduar leaves is mixed. Fully matured bottle gourd, ridge gourd, etc. are kept in sun over the roof top. During rains, these are kept in shade. Seeds of leafy vegetables, bitter gourd, kakri etc. are stored in cloth bag.
