 The rural backyard poultry production system need to be strengthened by the newly developed dual purpose poultry breed which achieved body weight closer to Vanaraja breed and egg production closer to Gramapriya in 72 weeks. Diagnostic kit “DIVA” developed for differentiating FMD infected and vaccinated animals is an important innovative technique which has got potential application in the field. The technology enters the agricultural sectors from two major sources. As primary source, farmers themselves were the main suppliers. Through their efforts in selecting plants, perfecting their tools and designing their crop mixtures and rotations, the traditional wisdom based agricultural production system evolved. Farmers efforts need to be supported by scientists through their innovative research and development approaches. Yet in today’s world of shrinking natural resources and rapidly raising human populations, traditional production systems are increasingly falling to meet the food and income needs of increasingly urbanized consumers, while some are in danger of breaking down altogether. Empowerment of farm women through development of income generating technologies and gender friendly agricultural equipments is one of the key area of focus toward empowerment of women with appropriate technologies. The innovative idea of using digital radiographs, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to detect internal disorders like spongy tissues in mango samples have got bright field of application in the coming years.
