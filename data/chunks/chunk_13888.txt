MANU8 Division of Agronomy, ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi 110 012 ABSTRACT Indian agriculture has extensive dryland farming due to climatic/rainfall conditions, which is highly dependent on natural rainfall. The dryland farming contributes significantly to the nation’s food production, supporting a large population and livestock. It accounts for two-thirds of the country’s livestock and 40% of its human population. Dry- land farming yields 83% of coarse cereals, 81% of pulses, 70% of oilseeds, 67% of cotton, and 40% of rice in India. However, drylands face several challenges, including low rainfall, poor soil fertility, and frequent droughts. Water scarcity and soil degradation further limit productivity, directly impacting food security. Additionally, dryland agricul- ture contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, mainly due to fertilizer use, crop residue decomposition, and fuel- powered farm operations.
