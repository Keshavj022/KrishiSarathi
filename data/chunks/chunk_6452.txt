 of India (DoF-Gol) supported the sea ranching programme of ICAR-CMFRI, with an objective to conserve and Marine Fish Stock Status of India (2022) ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24 96 FISHERIES MANAGEMENT maintain a sustainable stock of the green tiger shrimp in the wild. It is expected that this will benefit more than 35,000 fishermen who are directly involved in the Green tiger shrimp fishery and the ancillary sectors. Annually, 50 million PL20 of P. semisulcatus are ranched into the seagrass beds of the Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar with a target of releasing 200 million of PL20 in 4 years. Following this, the shrimp landings showed an increasing trend in the region (with an average increase of 17.51% compared to the base figure of 2017) during 2018-2022. The current (2022) harvest of the species from the region is about 10,600 tonnes (having a value R 380 crores per year). Fish catch estimates of Mahanadi, Krishna and Tapti rivers: Riverine fisheries, providing livelihood to uncountable number of riparian fishers, are under immense stress from damming and reduced headwater discharge, pollution, erratic rainfall, and excess fishing pressure, etc. However, quantitative information on fish catch from major rivers are lacking since decades. ICAR-Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute (ICAR-CIFRI), through intensive surveys, estimated fish catch and related information from some of the major rivers. In River Mahanadi, the annual total catch was estimated to be 15,134 tonnes with catch per unit effort (CPUE) ranging between 0.18 kg and 18.88 kg/ fisher/day. Catfishes, namely, Wallago attu, Sperata aor, S. seenghala, Eutropiichthys vacha and Silonia silondia dominated the catch (36.4%) followed by major carps (22.6%) and murrels (12.5%). The annual fish catch of the River Tapti and River Krishna were estimated at 6,946 tonne, and 18,902 tonnes with CPUE of 0.69-9.45 and 2-6.84 kg/fisher/day, respectively. Carps, catfishes, eels and small indigenous fishes (SIFs) contributed majorly to the total catch in both the rivers. The data showed significant contribution of the rivers in inland fish production. Weed-based fish aggregating devices for heavy metal amelioration in Loktak Lake Increasing pollution loads pose serious threats to inland open water fisheries. With aim towards pollution amelioration, ICAR-CIFRI examined effect of natural floating islands as fish aggregating devices (FADs), on distribution of heavy metals in the abiotic and biotic compartments in Loktak Lake. Concentrations of Cd, Pb, and other metals (Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn) in water inside the FADs were 73.91, 65.22 and 40.57-49.16% less, respectively as compared to outside the FADs. The fish species inside the FADs were also less contaminated (24.07-25.07% reduction in metal levels) with low health risk indices. The study signifies the role of natural floating islands in ameliorating the effect of heavy metals pollution towards better ecosystems and fish and human health.
