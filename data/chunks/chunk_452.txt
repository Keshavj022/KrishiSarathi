 Additionally, the ability to reduce chemical inputs may lead to more environmentally friendly farming practices. Plasma agriculture’s capacity to improve crop resilience to environmental stresses, such as climate change impacts, is a valuable asset in ensuring agricultural sustainability and food security. Moreover, post-harvest preservation capabilities can help reduce food waste and enhance food availability. However, certain obstacles must be overcome for widespread adoption. More research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects and compatibility of plasma technology with different crops and farming systems. The optimization of energy consumption and cost considerations are essential to ensure economic viability, particularly for small-scale farmers. Establishing standardized treatments and regulations will be crucial to ensure safe and effective application, while efforts to educate stakeholders and farmers about the benefits and safety of plasma agriculture are necessary for its successful implementation. In summary, plasma agriculture shows great potential to revolutionize modern farming practices, promoting sustainable and efficient agricultural systems. With continued research and advancements, plasma agriculture can play a vital role in addressing the evolving challenges of agriculture while contributing to a more sustainable and resilient future. SUMMARY The article explores how plasma treatments can enhance seed germination, plant growth, and soil health, ultimately leading to increased crop yields. Additionally, it highlights the potential of plasma in managing pests and diseases without the need for harmful chemicals, contributing to environmentally friendly farming practices. The article also discusses how plasma farming can optimize water usage and reduce the reliance on synthetic inputs, thus promoting a more resilient and efficient food production system. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: monie2384@gmail.com Indian Farming 21 October 2023 Improved agronomic practices for the cultivation of ryegrass Manish Kushwaha1* and Jasvinder Singh1 1Punjab Agricultural University Seed Farm, Nabha, Punjab 147 201 Ryegrass is a winter crop grown for getting high quality fodder. Its fodder is delicious, extremely nourishing, and easily digestible. It is multicut in nature and provides green fodder for 5-6 months from November to May. India currently has a 35.6% shortfall in green fodder. It is generally grown in pure stand but mixture/intercropping can also be done to fulfil this shortfall of green fodder deficit to some extent especially during lean period. With respect to seed production, most of the grasses including ryegrass are shy seeders with low seed production ability due to different factors. Forage crop seed availability meets about 15-20% of country needs.
