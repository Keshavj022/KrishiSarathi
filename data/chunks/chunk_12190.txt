Forage sorghum Zone I: Locations in northern India Zone II: Locations in southern India 34 GUIDELINES FOR TESTING CROP VARIETIES UNDER AICCIPS 7. Description of morphological features DUS testing guidelines notified by the PPV&FRA may be followed. Minimum traits required may be decided by the workshop. 8. Others Information on the available DNA markers may be recorded (based on the availability). Maize 1. Important characters on which data should be recorded A.
