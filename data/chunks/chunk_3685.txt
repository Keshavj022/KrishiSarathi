 Zinc was observed most crunch micronutrient (low in 77.8% orchards) followed by Cu (low in 44.5% orchards). Nutrient management options Depending on the slope, rainfall intensity and soil properties, well-known measures like bunding, terracing, plugging and strengthening of slides of gullies etc. have proved effective in citrus orchards. Mulching is also known to reduce the impact of rain and check erosion. The easily decomposable live mulches locally available are effectively used to combat such twin problems. The upper ridges of the hills should be under perennial plantations to reduce the initial velocity of run-off water down the slope. In the context of prevailing practices, hardly any citrus orchard receives optimum fertilizers according to its requirement and as such, no fertilizer schedules Nutrients Distribution pattern Low Optimum High Soil fertility constraints N 14.8 55.5 29.7 P 74.1 18.5 7.4 K 20.3 70.4 9.3 Ca 85.2 14.8 - Mg 83.3 16.7 - Fe - 3.7 96.3 Mn 33.0 18.5 48.5 Cu 33.3 20.4 46.3 Zn 77.4 9.3 13.3 Nutrients Leaf nutrient constraints N 48.1 22.2 29.7 P 81.5 14.8 3.7 K 27.8 64.8 7.4 Ca 79.7 20.3 - Mg 82.4 17.6 - Fe - 1.8 98.2 Mn 22.2 25.9 51.8 Cu 44.5 18.5 37.0 Zn 77.8 16.7 5.5 for different citrus cultivars have been worked out on scientific lines. Khasi mandarin orchards showed different optimum fertilizer doses. Studies carried out by ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Barapani at Umling (Near Burnihat), Meghalaya showed 300 g N + 250 g P2O5 + 300 g K2O was economical fertilizer dose in the experiment on rejuvenation of declining Khasi mandarin orchard. But, the best fertilizer dose consisted of 400 g N + 250 g P2O5 + 400 g K2O (Table 3). It is most important to remember that fertilizer rates considered as optimum, can still result in nutrient depletion at higher productivity levels, if continue, become sub-optimum rates. An encouraging response of different micronutrients on Khasi mandarin has been invariably obtained. Positive effects of various other nutrients like B, Mg and certain combinations of Zn, Cu, Mg and Ca on yield of Khasi mandarin could be easily obtained. A micronutrient dose of 200 g ZnSO4 + 100 g CuSO4 + 50g each of borax and ammonium molybdate to be enriched with 5-10 kg farmyard manure or alternatively any other manure, incubated for 8-10 days and thereafter should be applied either in half-moon trenches or within the skirt belt of trees established on terraced land treated earlier each tree with 5-10 kg/tree dolomite. Sometimes, nutrient enriched manures are filled up in inverted V-shaped trenches made in the upper elevated half portion of trees in order to facilitate the regulated movement of nutrients. Organic nutrient management Organic manures play a critical role in both short- term nutrient availability and long-term maintenance of soil organic matter vis-Ã -vis production sustainability, especially in small holder farming systems using on-farm modules.
