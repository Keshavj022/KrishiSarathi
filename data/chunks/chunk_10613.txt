 y y Establishment of micro-enterprises like processing drumstick leaves powder, aromatic rice and mahua seed decorticator. 2. Impact on Household Income The comparison of household income before and after the interventions (Table 51) revealed that the income increased three times between 2016-17 and 2020-21. The highest increase in net income was observed in allied sectors, like livestock, fisheries, and enterprises. Horticultural crops registered significant increase in share of total income from 16.59% (2016-17) to 26.88% (2020- 21). Field crops, the most dominant source of household income with 49.01 per cent contribution to additional income, experienced 130.00 per cent increase in income over base year.

Farmers from all land size classes benefited from the technological interventions (Table 52). However, the landless and marginal farmers benefited relatively more with 276.91 per cent and 223.20 per cent increase in income over base year, respectively.
