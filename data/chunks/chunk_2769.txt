 b) NRCPB for gene construct and molecular analysis of gene integration and event characterization ofthe original BN Bt and subsequently for purification of the BN- BtBNLA601. c) CICR for co-ordinating biosafety from 2005-2008 ofBN Bt and Bt NHH 44 when Dr. B. M. Khadi was the Director 3. Wbat was the role of CICR in tbe development of BN Bt? Bio-safety studies were coordinated from 2005-2008 through CICR under the leadership of Dr B. M. Khadi, Director CICR 4. We understand tbat tbe 'BN Bt' material from TI to T 3 generations during 2001- 2004 were tested for presence of cry lAc at 'Bt referral lab' at CICR, Nagpur. What type of planl malerial and huw many samples were tested? Samples from VAS Dharwad were brought only once to CICR in 2002. 874 vials containing crushed leaf homogenates were brought on 9th December 2002 by Dr Vamadevaiah, Assoc. Prof Biochemistry and Miss Anita (RA VAS Dharwad). All the samples were tested through ELISA for presence ofCrylAc protein. The analysis was carried out only to help/assist the researchers. I was not associated in the NATP project, though some initial preliminary proposal documents listed my name for aspects on resistance management. 5. When was the 'Bt Referral Lab' established at CICR, Nagpur? The CICR laboratory was declared as Bt referral laboratory on 1211> N<>vember 2003 6. What were the techniques used to detect the presence ofcry lAc, BN Bt event and Cry protein? Were the samples also tested for 'MON 531'? What were the results and were these communicated to UAS, Dharwad? Only ELISA techoique was used to test the samples for the presence ofCryIAc protein. The samples were not tested for Mon 531. Some samples were positive. Dr Vamadevaiah carried the results with him personally. 7. DUring 2005, what plant material and how many samples were analysed for the presence ofcry lAc, 'BN Bt' event and Cry protein. a) Twenty leafsamples were sent by Dr V. V. Singh in August 2005. Sixteen were positive forCrylAc protein on ELISA test. Sixteen samples were also positive on PCR for 500 bp amplicon ofcrylAc gene. PeR gel was run on 21-8-2005. b) Twenty two Ieafsamples were sent by Dr V. V. Singh on 13-9-2005 and tested for the presence ofCrylAc protein using dip-sticks. Nineteen were positive. c) Nine leafsamples were sent to the lab on 26-9-2005 by Dr Sumanbala Singh for CrylAc ELISA. Seven were positive for CrylAc protein. d) Ten DNA samples (DNA extracted on 19-8-05 and positive for crylAc) were tested for Mon 531 5'-junction region specific primers using PeR on 27-9-05. All ten were positive for Mon 531. e) Thirty seven leafsamples were sent by Dr V. V. Singh on 27-9-05. PCR testing was done on 29-9-05 using three primers specific for Mon 531. Six were homozygous and twenty three were heterozygous for Mon 531. f) Sixteen samples were sent by Dr V. V. Singh on 9-10-2005. Mon 531 event specific primers were used in PCR on 11-10-2005. Six samples were homozygous and eight were heterozygous for Mon 531.
