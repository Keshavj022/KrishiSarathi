 For very late sowing conditions (January), the seed rate should be enhanced to 60kg/acre. Under irrigated normal sown conditions, 40:20:10 NPK & under very late sown conditions 32:16:10 NPK kg/acre should be used. Under un-irrigated conditions, 24:12:8 NPK is required. Once in three years apply 8kg Zinc sulphate per acre. Rapeseed – Mustard It requires cool climate during early stages (15 to 25°C) of crop growth. For maturity, higher temperature is required. Varieties Sub-tropical (Early sowing- 1st week of September to 30th September): Pusa Bahar, Pusa Basant, Pusa Mustard-25 Sub-tropical (Timely sowing irrigated- 2nd fortnight of October): Giriraj (DRMRIJ-31), RH-749, RSPR-69, NRCDR-2, RSPR-01, RSPR-03, RL-1359, Kranti, Varuna, Pusa Bold. Sub-tropical (Timely sowing rainfed- 2nd fortnight of October): RH-406, RH-30 Sub-tropical (Late sown- First fortnight of November): NRCHB-101 Intermediate (up to 3000ft altitude where snowfall is not experienced)- 2nd fortnight of October: Kranti, Varuna, RH-3 Temperate (Above 3000 ft altitude- From end of September to 15th of October): KOS-1, KS-101 (Gulcheen) 1.75-2.0kg/acre of seed is required for Brassica juncea (Raya) and 2.5 kg/acre for B. compestris (KOS-l & KS-l0l) to sow 30 cm apart in rows and 10-15cm from plant to plant. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 47 For effective control of weeds in mustard apply fluchloralin or trifluralin @ 0.300 kg a.i./acre as pre plant incorporation (PPI) or pre-emergence application of pendimethalin @ 0.3 - 0.4 kg/acre or isoproturon @ 0.400 kg a.i./ acre or oxyfluorfen @ 60 ml/acre must be sprayed after dissolving in 200- 240 litres of water. 24:12:6 NPK along with Sulphur @ 8kg/acre is recommended. In case of prolonged dry spell, the foliar application of 0.05 % thio- urea at 50% flowering stage followed by 50 % siliquae filling stage by mixing 0.5 g thio-urea in one litre of water (7.5 grams in 15 litre pump) with a knapsack sprayer with flat fan T-jet nozzle using a spray volume of 700 litres per hectare must be sprayed between the period of moisture stress which coincides between 50-60 and 90- 100 days after sowing. One irrigation at time of thinning and other at siliquae development stage, (If there is no rainfall) has been found to give higher yield of this crop. Gobhi-Sarson Gobhi-sarson is a high yielding rabi oilseed crop, suitable growing both under irrigated and rainfed conditions. Varieties: GSL-1, GSL-2, DGS-1, GSC-7, RSPN-25 2kg/ acre of seed is required for sowing in lines 40-50 cm apart at a depth of 3 cm during first fortnight of October as a pure crop & by third week of September intercrop with toria. For transplanting, 60 days old seedlings may be used in the last week of November. For irrigated, 24:16:8 NPK & for un-irrigated areas, 20:12:6 NPKalongwith 8kg/acre of Sulphur is recommended.
