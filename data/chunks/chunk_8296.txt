 Molecular identification and pathology of hydatid cyst: The presence of mitochondrial enzyme nad1 and cox1 confirmed the prevalence of both Echinococcus ortleppi and E. granulosus in mithun. E. granulosus is the predominant species and provided an evidence for the circulation of E. ortleppi in mithun for the first time. Histopathological examination of hydatid cysts in the liver showed an extensive proliferation of fibrous connective tissue with eosinophilic and lymphocytic infiltration, whereas in lung parenchyma, severe emphysema with infiltration of alveolar macrophages and lymphocytic infiltration were observed. Molecular characterization of Mecistocirrus digitatus in mithun: Sequence analysis of internal transcribed spacer region-2 (ITS-2) and beta tubulin gene showed 100% identity with other isolates of M. digitatus. Poultry Diagnostics and prophylaxis: The overall incidence of avian leucosis virus (ALV) in the farm was reduced to 3.35% with 6.16, 9.5 and 0 and 5.2% mortality in Nicrobari, Gaghus, Assel and layer respectively. Marek’s disease virus (MDV) serotype 1, copies were detected in spleen, feather pulp and lymphocytes at all the 16 time intervals in vaccinated [HVT (Harpes virus turkey) +SB1 or HVT] and unvaccinated groups of birds under natural field conditions. These findings revealed that birds in all the groups were exposed to existing MDV serotype 1 circulating in the environment where the birds were housed. Gross and microscopic lesions were more severe in unvaccinated, less severe in HVT vaccinated and mild in HVT+SB1vaccinated birds. Fish Marine fish production: Marine capture fisheries production from mainland of India in 2015 was 3.40 million tonnes, representing a decline of 5.3% with respect to 2014. This decrease partly corresponds to drop in catches of Indian oil sardine. With the highest LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2016–17 84 catches of 7.20 lakh tonnes in 2012, oil sardine catches decreased to 2.66 lakh tonnes in 2015. Marine finfish species contributed more than 27.6 lakh tonnes to the total fish production, of which almost 18 lakh tonnes were pelagic species and 9.6 lakh tonnes were demersal. The remaining consisted of 4.2 lakh tonnes crustaceans and 2.2 lakh tonnes molluscs. The bulk of country’s landings (63%) came from southeast and northwest regions. Gujarat remains by far the largest producer with an estimated landing of 7.22 lakh tonnes and contributed one-fifth of country’s production. In all about 735 species were captured; maximum species diversity was found in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Valuation of marine fish landings during 2015 was estimated at ` 40,100 crore (26.30% increase over 2014) at landing centre (LC) level and ` 65,180 crore (24.48% increase over 2014) at the retail market (RM) level.
