The data highlights the potential of IFS to enhance profitability through diversified agricultural practices, with livestock and cropping systems serving as primary contributors to overall farm income. Other complementary enterprises, such as mushroom production and vermicomposting, further strengthen economic resilience and sustainability within these integrated systems. CONCLUSION The study revealed that Integrated farming system models on farms lead to significant income generation and a diverse array of food products that support farmers’ nutritional needs and livelihoods. IFS farms demonstrate greater productivity and profitability compared to conventional farming systems.
