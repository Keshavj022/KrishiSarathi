 (1) and (2) are correlated: utotal,max = uPcrop + uAcult + uFresd + uAaba + uFcult + uFdm + uFemiss (4) where utotal and utotal,max are total percent uncertainties considering the independent and correlated variables, respectively. uPcrop, uAcult, uFresd, uAaba, uFcult, uFdm, and uFemiss are percent uncertainties of Pcrop, Acult, Fresd, Aaba, Fcult, Fdm and Femiss, respectively.

M.V. Deshpande et al. Science of the Total Environment 904 (2023) 166944 7 Similar to Sahai et al. (2011), we used an expected uncertainty of ±0.1 % for agricultural activity data. The uncertainty of Fcult is thus considered to be ±0.20 %. Finally, Femiss is species-specific and is highly sensitive to environmental conditions, burning temperature and crop conditions. To account for such uncertainties, we conducted a thorough literature review of values found in previous studies (McMurray et al., 2017; Rasul et al., 2018; Sahai et al., 2007, 2011; Sahu et al., 2021; Streets et al., 2003) and performed statistical analysis using the Monte Carlo method for values that varied widely in the literature to improve the precision of our estimates. Ultimately, we reported the total uncer­ tainty range resulting from the uncertainties associated with each in­ dividual factor. We have estimated the final uncertainties by adding the fractional uncertainties of the individual components used in the equation (McMurray et al., 2017; Ellison and Williams, 2012). 4. Results 4.1. MCD64A1-based ABA 4.1.1. Validation Table S3 shows the accuracy assessment results for the present study when we validated our MCD64A1-based ABA, as explained in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. Our extracted ABA performed decently with 73 % overall accuracy, 27 % commission error, 23 % omission error, and an overall F1 score of 73 % for burned scars larger than 55 ha. We extracted district-wise ABA for all five seasons from 2011 to 2020. A total of 602 districts were selected from the states where consistent burning was observed for at least one season. 4.1.2. Spatio-temporal trends in ABA during 2011–2020 Fig. 2(a) gives an overview of the spatial distribution of ABA (in ha) over 602 districts across India. We observed a positive trend in ABA from about 3.0 million ha in 2011 to 4.50 million ha in 2020, with a 49 % increase in ABA in 2020 compared to 2011. The Kharif and Rabi seasons, the two major cropping seasons in India, accounted for 94 % of the total BA in 2011, decreasing slightly to 86 % in 2020 due to increased burning in other seasons. The IGP states showed a 21 % increase in ABA from 2011 to 2020, with Punjab and Haryana accounting for approximately 2.20 million ha, approximately 87 % of the total IGP ABA in 2020. In 2011, the IGP accounted for 70 % of total ABA, which decreased to 56 % in 2020.
