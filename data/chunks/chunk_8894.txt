 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE POPLAR -WHEAT/ SUGARCANE SYSTEM The studies at Ludhiana, revealed that grain yield of wheat decreased significantly with increase in age of poplar spaced at 4.5 × 4.5 m. The reduction in grain yield increased from 11.05% in one year old plantation to 44.94% in five year old plantation, but this reduction in yield is compensated by poplar growth (height 21 m and DBH 22.5 cm). The economic analysis of the poplar -wheat / sugarcane system revealed 1:4.45 C:B ratio with 400 trees/ha in 8 year rotation. Performance of Aonla -Blackgram Land Use System The growth performance and survival of aonla was better under various in-situ moisture conservation techniques as compared to control during 4th year at Jhansi. It started fruiting after four years of plantation and yielded 3.90 to 21.77 kg fruits/ plant. The 11th year of varietal evaluation of aonla under rainfed conditions indicated that the average fruit yield/plant was 109.67 kg, 88.25 kg, 89.14 kg and 61.40 kg in variety Kanchan, NA -7, Krishna and Chakaiya, respectively. With such high level of aonla production in marginal lands, aonla at 10 m × 6 m spacing (166 plants/ha) can give an yield of 12.0 to 15.0 tonnes/ha of fruits/year at the age of 11 years. Apart from fruit yield of aonla, 0.122 to 0.135 tonne/ha grain yield of intercrop (blackgram) was obtained from the system. The economic analysis of the system resulted in B : C ratio of 1 : 2.24 for 200 tree/ha with blackgram as kharif crop with pay back period of 5 years. Agri-horticultural System of Wheat with Peach at Solan In an agri-horticultural system developed at Solan, performance of four wheat varieties at three nitrogen levels were studied in association with peach. The wheat yield reduced by 18.45% due to peach over the sole crop, but the application of 25% over dose above the recommended (80 kg/ha) helped in increasing the wheat yield and compensated for 50% reduction in yield. In economic terms, this system gave net return of Rs 43,000/ha over Rs 26,000/ha compared to sole crop. Silvipastoral System Studies on growth and biomass production of three tree species Acacia nilotica var. cupressiformis, Dalbergia sissoo and Hardwickia binata conducted at Jhansi, during 9th year revealed that the total biomass (7.06 tonnes/ha) obtained in association with D. sissoo was higher than other two silvipastoral systems. However, pasture alone gave maximum yield of 7.50 tonnes/ha. Organic carbon and total N for H. binata based system varied between 6.5 - 8.2 g/kg and 0.066-0.075% below canopy at 0-15 cm depth while corresponding values for D. sissoo were 6.5-7.9 g/ kg and 0.059-0.075%, respectively. The studies conducted at Kattupakkam showed that the Colopogonium, if integrated as under storey in mango plantation would yield 0.969 tonne of dry fodder, 0.116 tonnes digested protein/ha and can sustain 3- 4 number of sheep in one hectare. Cost: Benefit Ratio of Silvipastoral System The system resulted in C:B ratio of 1:1.
