Another challenge was to complete the cross-breeding within the limited time of fertilization and carried out by semi-technical hatchery managers. Therefore, it was necessary to expose the concerned stakeholders to the application of the technology and understand their needs. Realizing these challenges, a total of 370 hatchery owners/ state fisheries officials/ young entrepreneurs/ research scholars, etc., from 20 states were exposed to the technology through in-house training and on- farm demonstrations, during the last four years. Based on the interest, capacity, and logistics, the partners from different states were selected for applying cross-breeding through on-farm work and demonstrations.
