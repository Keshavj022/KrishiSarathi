 The Eastern Ghats and Western Pollination in cucurbits through honey bees Apis mellifera colony Indian Horticulture 108 Ghats and the Himalayan North Eastern region are also favourable for beekeeping. The number of bee colonies required per hectare depends on the crop. Generally, 3-9 bee colonies of good strength are required for one hectare of vegetable crops. Vegetables that benefit from honey bees by pollination To gather pollen and nectar, honey bee workers forage from flower to flower and fly great distances. Their foraging activity ensures that the subsequent plants are pollinated, which enhances fruit yield, speeds up maturity, and creates a more symmetrical fruit shape. Honey bee pollination benefits a variety of vegetables, including carrot, cucumber, pumpkin, sponge and ridge gourd, squash, radish, okra, turnip, canola, peas, beans, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, Chinese cabbage, onion, coriander, etc. Importance of honey bees for higher yield and quality seed production in vegetables One of the most crucial elements determining the yield of crop seeds is honey bee pollination. Both crop productivity and seed quality are increased. Insufficient pollination lowers yields and degrades seed quality. Even if some of these plant species have pollinators that are insects other than honey bees, these plants nevertheless rely on or benefit to some level from bee pollination. Managed honey bees improve the seed weight and germination rate. For example, although cotton is self- pollinated, but honey bee pollination increased cotton production, seed germination, and oil content. Due to the pollination process of bees, the seed production of many vegetable crops increases by 1.25 to 1.5 times. Due to the unisexuality of cucurbits class of vegetables or the separation of male and female flowers in the same plant on different flowers, the pollination by bees is helpful in the aggregation process of 30 to 100% of the fruits. In vegetables like brinjal, honey bees contribute to the 25â€“150% increase in fruit output. Honey bees promote the production of seeds in several vegetables in addition to fruits. While the numbers are 100-300% in cabbage and 100-125% in turnip, the seed production increased by 22-100 and 9.1-135.4% in radish and carrot, respectively. Table 1 shows increased seed yields for several vegetables.
