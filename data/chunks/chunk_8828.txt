12 tonnes) and oilseeds (877.83 tonnes), followed by pulses (474.33 tonnes), forages (39.46 tonnes) and fibres (33.60 tonnes). Seed Technology Hybrid seed production technology: In rice, results generated have indicated that flag leaf is a good indicator for panicle emergence in A, B and R lines. Hence, it could be used for obtaining synchronization in flowering of male and female lines through staggered planting. Micronutrient (Borax 0.25-1.00%) and growth regulator (TIBA at 22-75 ppm) spray in sunflower could enhance seed quality as vigour index. Seed hydration combined with 2% urea spray at button formation helped to bring synchronization of flowering (advance flowering by 3-5 days in late parent) in parental lines of sunflower hybrid DSH 1. ECONOMICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FARMERS OF MIDDLE GUJARAT FOR RAISING TOBACCO NURSERY FREE OF SPODOPTERA LITURA ● ●● ●● Apply two sprays of neem-based formulations, either NSKS @ 10/kg (ICBR 1 : 399) or Azadex @ 1.0 l/ha (ICBR 1: 236) or Nimbecidine @ 1.5 l/ha (ICBR 1 : 135). Frst spray is to be given 20 days after germination and second spray 10 days after the first spray. ● ●● ●● Alternatively, one application of Dipel @ 0.75 kg/ha (ICBR 1 : 209) or Bioasp @ 0.75 kg/ha (ICBR 1 : 113) after 30 days of sowing of seeds in nursery; or two sprays (20 and 30 days after germination) of Cypermethrin 0.01% (ICBR 1 : 272) or Polytrin- C 0.0495% (ICBR 1 : 204) or Spark 0.036% (ICBR 1 : 191) or Deltamethrin 0.0028% (ICBR 1 : 185) or Chlorpyriphos 0.04% (ICBR 1 : 175) are recommended. Modified flue-pipe system of tobacco-curing, designed by the TIDE, Bangalore, gives about 25% saving in wood fuel consumption in Karnataka compared to conventional flue-pipe system ● ●● ●● Flag leaf in rice indicates panicle emergence in A, B and R lines. This can be used for synchronization in flowering of male and female lines through staggered planting. ● In HHB 94 pearl millet, male: female planting ratio of 2:10 has showed promise for hybrid seed production. ● Economics of hybrid seed production shows cost:benefit ratio of 1:1.8 for cotton (Hyderabad); 1:2.41 for castor (Jamnagar); 1:1.69 for pearl millet (Rahuri) and 1:1.67 for sunflower (Bangalore rabi). DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2001–2002 42 In pearl millet, a planting ratio of 2:10 (male : female) for HHB 94 at Hisar and 2:16 for hybrid Saburi at Rahuri have been found promising and recommended. Economics of hybrids seed production have showed maximum cost:benefit ratio of 1:1.8 for cotton (Hyderabad); 1:2.41 for castor (Jamnagar); 1:1.67 for pearl millet (Rahuri) and 1:1.67 for sunflower (Bangalore, rabi). Seed storage: Breeder and certified seeds of soybean should be packed in poly- lined jute canvas bags after drying to 9% m.c. to retain its viability during validation period.
