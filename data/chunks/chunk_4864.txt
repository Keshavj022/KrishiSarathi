 Despite their potential, the adoption of these technologies faces barriers such as high costs, lack of skilled operators, and regulatory challenges. To scale up these innovations, government support and training are crucial. High-throughput phenotyping and imaging technologies further enhance stress management by providing valuable insights into crop health and development. Overall, digital tools are transforming the Indian horticulture landscape, offering significant potential to enhance productivity, sustainability, and resilience against abiotic stresses. Novemberâ€“December 2024 39 Digital technologies for assessing abiotic stresses Remote sensing (RS) involves capturing and analysing reflected or emitted energy to gather information on vegetation health, crop conditions, and environmental factors. Utilizing technologies from the ground, air, and space, RS provides multispectral, spatial, and temporal data that aid in crop yield estimation and monitoring. RS applications include crop inventory, production forecasting, leaf area index (LAI) estimation, and drought or flood damage assessment. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) combine spatial data with agronomic information to map stress factors, such as soil salinity or drought-prone areas, facilitating targeted interventions. GIS also enables land suitability assessments, as demonstrated in mango cultivation, by analysing factors such as soil texture and groundwater availability. This helps farmers make informed decisions regarding crop pattern and management. By integrating data over time, GIS allows the tracking of changing stress conditions, identifying trends, and assessing long-term impacts on horticultural crops. High-resolution imagery and thermal monitoring can also assist in the detection of plant stress under varying irrigation regimes. Internet of Things (IoT) systems deploy smart sensors to monitor environmental conditions such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real time. These sensors continuously collect data, enabling early detection of stress indicators. AI and machine learning algorithms analyse data to identify stress patterns, predict severity, recommend timely interventions, optimize crop management, and improve resilience. In addition, machine learning models can forecast future stress events by assessing historical data, weather patterns, and crop growth stages, allowing for proactive and targeted management strategies that enhance crop health and productivity. Agricultural weather stations enable real-time monitoring of production factors and environmental conditions. Equipped with various meteorological instruments and sensors, these stations collect and record key parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall. The data are then transmitted in real time to a central database or cloud platform via an automated recording system for analysis and processing.
