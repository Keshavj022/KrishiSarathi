Puppala et al. Technology in Society 74 (2023) 102335 11 scenario, especially in India. Experts’ perception, translated in the form of scores, suggests that lack of monitory support is a barrier making ‘lack of incentives. This is justifiable as the investment cost of currently available drones is considerably huge for a farmer and may be a barrier even if he is convinced to adopt to currently available UAVs. Analysing the type of costs associated with drones by explicitly dedicating a separate category i.e., ‘economic category,’ obtained the third rank among categories, depicting that investment cost is the prime barrier followed by cost of skilled labour, maintenance cost, and cost of components. Subsequently, the operational barrier category follows next in the hierarchy. The most significant barrier in this category is ‘skilled workforce’, which limits the ability to adopt UAV technology in the Indian agricultural sector.
