 Implementing climate-smart agriculture technology (CSAT) is essential for ensuring food security and promoting economic growth in the context of sustainable agriculture. Climate change and weather patterns signiﬁcantly affect agricultural yield, necessitating the implementation of more efﬁcient, productive, and climate-resilient techniques. However, the use of CSAT is a behavioural decision that affects the subjective well-being of the users. Using smart agricultural practices reduces climate change's impact on agricultural productivity and promotes sustainable agriculture, improving adopters' welfare. This study examines how the use of CSAT affects rural households' subjective well-being in Odisha, India. The result of the study shows that the use of CSAT signiﬁcantly affects the subjective well-being of the farmers. The measured impact is 0.149, 0.181, and 0.144 for farmers whose intensity is 0.251–0.500, 0.501–0.750, and 0.751 and above, respectively, as compared to farmers whose intensity is 0.0–0.250. This implies greater satis- faction for farmers who engage in the moderate use of CSAT practices. Low utilization of technology may not yield beneﬁts for farmers, while the adoption of advanced technology may not be economically viable. Additionally, CSAT is not easily available to households residing in low-lying areas, preventing them from improving their well- being. Only a small number of landowners in impoverished areas utilize CSAT. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate government regulations regarding land and tenancy as well as develop measures for farmers to adapt to new technologies. 1. Introduction The world's population is projected to grow by over 33% by 2050, necessitating signiﬁcant changes to the existing agricultural system to meet the rising demand for food, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2013). A recent report by FAO states that global food demand is expected to increase from 35% to 56% between 2010 and 2050 due to a shift in consumer preferences for food products (van Dijk et al., 2021). Similarly, Mittal (2012) stated that India's food demand will increase largely due to an increase in population and per capita income. However, production is anticipated to be signiﬁcantly hampered by low yield growth, posing a substantial challenge to meeting India's long-term food requirements through domestic production alone (Kumar et al., 2009). Another recent report states India's signiﬁcant share of global food demand stands at 24.3%, second only to China at 16.7% (Islam and Karim, 2019). The United Nations' demographic projections estimate that by 2065, India's population will be about 1.718 billion, requiring 567 million tons of food. Additionally, a 60% increase in agricultural pro- ductivity is targeted to be achieved by the year 2050 for the entire globe.
