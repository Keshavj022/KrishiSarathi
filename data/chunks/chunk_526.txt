 Propagation of kiwifruit through grafting and budding on seedling rootstock Tongue grafting and chip budding are popular kiwifruit propagation methods, cost-effective for large-scale multiplication, but require two years for nursery plant development. Prior to sowing in February, seeds undergo stratification in moist sand for 30–35 days at 0–5°C to break dormancy. Germinating seedlings are sensitive to sunlight, so shade or shade nets protect them. Transplantation into polybags and nursery beds occurs between July and August, reaching grafted size within a year. The grafting process, done from the last week of January to the end of February, achieves a high success rate of 90–95% for bud-take. To ensure growth and development, proper nursery management is essential, including regular weeding, irrigation, and staking. Moreover, appropriate fertilization, pest, and disease management are crucial for healthy plant growth and successful crop production. Building a T-bar trellis system to support kiwifruit plant growth Kiwifruit plants are typically planted at a spacing of 4 m × 4 m between rows and 6 m × 6 m between individual plants when trained on the T-bar trellis system. Planting is done during the dormant season, usually from December to January. It’s crucial to maintain a male to female ratio of 1:8 or 1:9 to ensure proper pollination for good fruit set and yield since kiwifruit plants are dioecious, with separate male and female plants. The T-bar trellis system, similar to that used for grapevines, provides support for the vine crop. Pillars are placed 6 m apart in rows, and each pole has a cross arm carrying five outrigger Staminate (male) flower Pistillate (female) flower Propagation by hardwood cuttings Kiwifruit plant Indian Farming 35 September 2023 wires spaced 45 cm apart. Vines are trained along the wires as a single stem with two leaders in opposite directions along the center wire. Temporary fruiting arms are then selected along both sides of each leader for better fruit production. Optimizing kiwifruit plant growth with proper pruning techniques Pruning is an important management practice in kiwifruit cultivation to promote high yield of quality fruit production and manage excessive vegetative growth. The following principles are kept in mind while pruning: • Fruits develop on the current season’s growth arising from one-year-old shoots. • Only the basal buds of nodes 4–12 on the current season’s growth are productive. • Vines grow 2–3 m every year, which can become overcrowded if not controlled by summer and winter pruning. • The shoots developed on older wood by heading back will not fruit normally in the first season. To achieve the above principles, pruning is carried out in a 3–4 year lateral replacement system. In dormant pruning, in the month of January and February, the fruiting lateral is cut back to 2 vegetative buds beyond the last fruit.
