Pig farming opens a new window for economic empowerment of tribal youths ‘Mising’, a tribal community of Assam had been rearing pig in almost every household from time immemorial as a part of their traditional culture. Pork constitutes an integral part of offering in social functions like marriage, death ceremony and other religious & social functions. Rearing pigs by the Mising community is practiced not only to meet the requirement of meat but also to generate additional income from the sale of surplus pigs as meat and piglets.
