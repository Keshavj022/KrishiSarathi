HORTICULTURAL CROPS Code :170 Title of the ITK :Pest management in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum by using leaf extract of Cynodon dactylon Description of the ITK : ]Root rot and damping off in tomato is controlled by applying Cynodon leaf extract. This is applicable only for tomato PKM-1 (local variety) in Karikuttanoor village at Dharmapuri. Fresh leaves of Cynodon dactylon (doob in Hindi, arugampul in Tamil) are dried in shade. The dried sample is powdered and then mixed with water and placed in an air tight mud pot and left undisturbed for 24 hours. This mixture is filtered twice, first using gunny cloth and then with a white piece of cloth. The clear mixture is ready for use. One litre of this mixture is added to one llitre water, which is sprayed either by using hand sprayer or by power sprayer. When tomato seedling is 15 days old, this mixture can be sprayed at frequent intervals until harvest. For 1 acre of land, 10 litres of this solution is recommended. Control of root rot and damping will result in good yield. It is best suited only for tomato PKM-1 in Thai pattam (January season). Name and address of the discloser : Shri. P. Krishnamoorthy, S/o.
