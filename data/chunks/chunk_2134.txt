Given the importance of the agriculture sector, Government of India has taken several steps for its development in a sustainable manner. Steps have been taken to improve the income of farmers. Further, to mitigate risk in the agriculture sector, a scheme “Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana” (PMFBY) was also launched in 2016. Schemes such as Formation & promotion of 10,000 FPOs & the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund have also been launched recently to benefit the sector. 1.2 As per the Land Use Statistics 2016-17, the total geographical area of the country is 328.7 million hectares, of which 139.4 million hectares is the reported net sown area and 200.2 million hectares is the gross cropped area with a cropping intensity of 143.6%.
