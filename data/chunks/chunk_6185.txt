4 ug/g in leaf), protein (av. 41.14-60.32 mg/ g in leaf) polyphenol oxidase activity (0.11 and 0.23 A: activity/min./g in leaf and bark, respec- tively), Peroxidase activity (0.6 unit/min/g in leaf and catalase activity (3.5 units/min./g in leaf) but less in chlorophyll (av. 1.04-1.57 and 0.46-0.87 mg/g in leaf and bark, respectively), Phenolics (av. 1.88-4.99 and 0.33-1.53 µg/g in leaf and bark, respectively) protein content in bark (11.28- 13.36 mg/g) and peroxidase and catalase activity in bark (0.1 and 7.0 unit/min/g, respectively). These changes might have influenced profuse shoot initiation from the node of the branches, leading to flowering even in the off-season. Hence the yield in the bending and pruning treatment also increased (18.55-48.64 kg/plant) compared with the control plants (15.13 kg/plant). The nutritive value of the guava fruits had also been influenced by this new practice. In the fruits of treated plants under bending and pruning, total soluble sugar increased (6.66 2-7.69%) but ascorbic acid content decreased (0.212-0.222%) compared with those of control. □ Contents FARM IMPLEMENTS Code Title of the ITK Description of the ITK : 2039 : Pingali dhanti for intercultural operation in tomato : Bullock-drawn pingali dhanti can be effectively used for weed control in tomato both during kharif and rabi instead of hand-weeding. It can cover an area of 0.4 ha/day with a cost of operation of Rs 150/ha. By adopting this, clean weeding is achieved. It costs about Rs 100. Name and address of the discloser : Shri B. Narsimha Rao, Meerkhanpet, Kandukur, Ranga Reddy (Andhra Pradesh) Location of use of the ITK Experimenters : Meerkhanpet village, Kandukur mandal, Ranga Reddy dist. (Andhra Pradesh) : Dr B. Sanjeeva Reddy, Scientist, Senior Scale (FMP), Dr G. Nirmala, Scientist, Senior Scale (Agricultural Extension) and Dr G.Subba Reddy, Head, Division of Crop Sciences,Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad (Andhra Pradesh) 500 059 METHODOLOGY The Meerkhanpet village of Kandukur mandal of Ranga Reddy district, where the ITK is being practised was chosen for validation during 2002- 03,2003-04 and 2004. The farmers in that village were stratified as per the size of the holding into marginal (<1.0 ha), small (1-2 ha), medium (2-A ha) and big (>4.0 ha). The farmers for this investigation were selected by stratified random sampling, representing 5% under each category. Focus group interactions were organized to identify the farmers voluntarily to participate in the validation process. The implement as per the specifications of pingali dhanti was fabricated with the help of local artisans. Five farmers representing different categories were selected and trained to acquaint with the various methodologies to implement the programme of validation.
