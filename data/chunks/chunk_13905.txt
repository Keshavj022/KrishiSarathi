 This re- duction in groundwater usage is vital for maintaining the long-term sustainability of water resources. Compared to conventional tillage, zero tillage has been shown to reduce soil erosion by up to 80% (Plaza-Bonilla et al., 2015). CA also plays a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture. The adoption of re- duced tillage and cover cropping enhances carbon seques- tration in soils, thus mitigating the release of CO2 into the atmosphere. Moreover, the decreased reliance on synthetic fertilizers under CA practices reduces N2O emissions, a potent GHG (Bhatia et al., 2023). According to Lal (2015), CA practices also lower fuel consumption due to fewer tillage operations, further decreasing the carbon footprint of agricultural activities. This reduction in GHG emissions is particularly important in the context of cli- mate change mitigation. Biodiversity enhancement is an- other key benefit of CA (Ghosh et al., 2019), particularly in monoculture-dominated drylands. CA promotes crop diversification (Ghosh et al., 2023a), which leads to greater biodiversity both above and below ground. This increased biodiversity is crucial for natural pest control (Nichols et al., 2015), reducing the need for chemical pes- ticides, which have negative environmental impacts. Crop rotations and the use of cover crops in CA can break pest and disease cycles, thereby improving overall ecosystem resilience. Furthermore, CA contributes to improving soil health and productivity through better nutrient cycling and organic matter accumulation (Bhattacharyya et al., 2013). Continuous crop cover and reduced soil disturbance pre- vent the breakdown of organic matter and promote the formation of stable soil aggregates, which are essential for maintaining soil fertility (Raj et al., 2023). Bhattacharyya et al. (2015) suggested that CA practices can lead to a sig- nificant increase in soil organic carbon content, which is vital for the long-term sustainability of agricultural sys- tems in drylands. Identifying genotypes with characteris- tics, like a more vigorous emergence or a higher resilience to various diseases, that are better suited to conservation tillage is also essential (Herrera et al., 2013). CA provides a sustainable pathway for enhancing agricultural produc- tivity (Ghosh et al., 2023b) while minimizing environ- mental impacts (Gupta et al., 2016). The widespread adoption of CA in dryland regions could play a critical role in ensuring food security and environmental sustainability in India. Watershed and water management A watershed functions as a multifaceted unit, encom- passing hydrological, biophysical, and socioeconomic- political dimensions, and serves as an integrated ecosys- tem characterized by the flow of materials, energy, and information.
