 After the estimation of emissions, the soil was returned to its original position in the respective pots. We used the basal trap method using NaOH (2.0 M) in air-tight sealed soil respiration jars with NaOH blanks (control) and treatment samples to calculate CO2 flux as explained in Haney et al. (2002). The setup is incubated at 25◦C for 24 h to capture the CO2 produced using NaOH and BaCl2, which was back-titrated with 1 M HCl with phenolphthalein as an indicator to determine the amount of CO2 evolved using equation (Schinner et al., 1995): Treatment carbon dioxide emission = (V −S) × 2.2 × 102 Soil weight(%dm) 4 A.

Results and discussion 3.1. Seasonal variability in atmospheric CO2 Fig. 2 shows the monthly variation of atmospheric CO2 concentrations averaged for the study period (i.e., 2009– 2020) over India. Although the seasonality in atmospheric CO2 is mainly influenced by the transport processes (viz. Convection, Advection and Diffusion), as explained in Krishnapriya et al. (2020), the variations near-surface have strong source correlations (Shusterman et al.
