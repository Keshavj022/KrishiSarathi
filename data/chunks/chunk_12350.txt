   Lack of established marketing channel   Lack of storage facilties   Lack of legislation to use safer pesticides to honeybees. The application of pesticides during flowering period without information cause severe damage to bee colonies.   Lack of initiatives for promoting bee flora during afforestation. E. Mushroom Production Nutrition levels of poor farmers can be improved by increasing mushroom production. There is considerable demand for medicinal mushrooms in addition to edible mushroom species. Straw is being better utilized by promoting mushroom production. For this, the availability of mushroom seeds and quality compost is important. So far, 7 Mushroom span units have been established in the state to overcome the shortage of Mushroom Span (seed). The production is being encouraged by setting up a group of mushroom producing farmers, especially the women farmers. Training is being organized to give information to women farmers about this technique. The production is being linked to the market. The Government has also targeted to setup 20 mushroom production units and 10 mushroom span units by 2022. 4.2 Strategy and interventions for Doubling Farmers’ income by 2022 Strategy 1. Improving wheat productivity through zero tillage in rice-wheat system (in all the zones of Bihar)   Zero tillage (ZT) with and without residue retention (‘conservation agriculture’ implies ZT with residue retention) has demonstrated considerable agronomic and economic benefits, State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 68 while improving the environmental footprint of agriculture by reducing energy costs and improving soil and water quality.   Zero tillage proves better for direct-seeded rice, maize, soybean, cotton, pigeonpea, mungbean, clusterbean, pearlmillet during kharif season and wheat, barley, chickpea, mustard and lentil during rabi season.   Wheat sowing after rice can be advanced by 10-12 days by adopting this technique compared to conventionally tilled wheat, and wheat yield reduction caused by late sowing can be avoided.   In ZT wheat, agronomic factors leading to productivity advantages are related to (i) time savings in crop establishment, allowing earlier sowing and, hence, reducing risks of terminal heat stress during the grain-filling phase; (ii) better control of weeds, such as Phalaris minor; (iii) better nutrient management; and (iv) water savings.   In Bihar ZT to facilitate an advancement of wheat sowing can be exploited in well-drained areas. Strategy 2. Integrated Farming System Approach Two integrated farming system (IFS models) have been developed by the ICAR RCER Patna. One acre model (for irrigated midland situation): Crops(3500 m2) + Goat(20+1 nos.
