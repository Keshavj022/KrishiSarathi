 Technical films on horticultural crops: BAU, Sabour has produced a series of technical films designed to educate farmers on advanced horticultural techniques, pest control measures, and post-harvest technologies. These films, broadcast on local television and made available online, visually demonstrate complex farming practices, making it easier for farmers to adopt new methods. University had developed around >500 plus technical films for the farmers out of which around 20% address the Horticultural issues of the eastern India, viz. mango, litchi, banana, guava, aonla etc. cultivation and value-addition. Precision horticulture with IoT and AI: The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into horticulture has enabled farmers to monitor critical environmental parameters such as soil moisture, nutrient levels, and weather patterns in real time. IoT sensors, connected to mobile applications, provide farmers with timely advice on irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. AI models further enhance decision-making by predicting crop yields and advising on optimal harvest times, helping farmers to plan more effectively and improve marketability of the perishable produce. Community radio initiative of BAU, Sabour Participation of farmers in Krishi Gyan Vahan Social media for agricultural extension: Social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube are increasingly being used by BAU to disseminate information related to horticultural crops. Farmers join dedicated groups where they can access tutorials, success stories, and expert advice. Live Q&A sessions and videos on new technologies to further expand BAU’s out-reach, making horticultural knowledge more accessible to a broader audience.

At BAU, Sabour drones are used to monitor crop health, assess plant growth, and apply inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides with precision. This technology reduces labour costs, ensures the uniform application of inputs, November–December 2024 61 and enhances overall productivity by enabling precision farming techniques. Challenges and Future prospects Despite the remarkable success of BAU’s digital initiatives, challenges remain. Limited digital literacy among farmers, gaps in rural infrastructure, and the cost of advanced technologies such as drones and IoT devices are significant barriers to widespread adoption.
