 Berseem, most abundantly available green fodder, has high protein percentage and water content, can easily support production level of lactating and growing animals. If there is shortage of green fodder, then 25-30 kg of leguminous fodder can be mixed with 5-10 kg of wheat straw for feeding larger animals. In addition to this 3 kg of concentrate mixture will be sufficient to maintain the body temperature. To avoid incidences of bloat in winter, the leguminous fodders should be mixed with either non legumes or wheat straw. Routing vaccination and deworming should be carried out. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 331 Disinfect the farm premises with suitable chemicals such as 1% hypochloride + bleaching powder (7gm in 1 liter of water) or 1% sodium hypochlorite with proper care. Sheep & Goat Ensure clean, fresh, and lukewarm water in adequate quantities to prevent colic and impaction. Legumes should be mixed with straw to prevent bloat. Make sure that the stored winter feed is mould- free and of good nutritional quality. Strictly avoid early morning grazing on frosty herbs and snow- covered grasses which otherwise cause’s huge loss by way of diseases like Braxy/Bradsot. Timely vaccination like Enterotoxaemia Vaccine should be ensured to prevent clostridial diseases. Proper anthelmintic dosing of animals may be done after seeking advice from veterinarian. Do not shear the wool or cut the hairs of the sheep in the winter season. Poultry During this winter maintain proper shed temperature and make availability of ample lukewarm drinking water to maintain body temperature of birds. It is essential to give the chicken plenty of food as they require extra energy for maintaining body temperature. Use anti-stress vitamins such as vimeral to increase immunity and to reduce climatic stress. Bedding material i.e., litter, around 6-inch depth is needed in houses during winter. Litter insulates the chicks from the cooling effects of the ground and provides protection cushion between bird and floor as it gives warmth to the birds during winter. Ensure vaccination of chicks and birds against Ranikhet and IBD disease if not done earlier. Deworming of the birds should be carried out using proper dewormer after every 3 months’ interval.
