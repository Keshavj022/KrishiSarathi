Due to the very strict constraint of additional availability of agricultural land for producing more food, enhancement of agricultural productivity becomes very important component of the overall strategy of Government of India to ensure food security for their people. Although Indian potato productivity is much higher than the world average and about 95% potato production comes under short days conditions in rabi season where yield potential is already compromised vis-à-vis the long day conditions, yet India can easily enhance its potato productivity by 25% during the period of 7 years. This productivity enhancement is possible with the help of two simple developments in the form of ensuring healthy seed potato and spreading the extent of micro-irrigation (especially drip irrigation) technology in areas which are still left out. Significance of judicious use of water is generally practiced at very low level in India. There is a potential of saving more than 50% irrigation water with the help of micro-irrigation systems in potato cultivation. Fortunately, the current union government has been stressing very high on this aspect. Drip irrigation, during recent years, has become a new successful technology in Indian potato cultivation. In a survey study based on farmers’ personal experiences, 33% higher potato yield was reported in Gujarat state of India under drip irrigation system (Benefit-Cost Ratio=1.67) compared to furrow irrigation (Benefit Cost Ratio=1.37). In an agronomy field trial having row-to- row distance of 60 cm, plant-to-plant distance of 10 cm and height of the ridge at 20 cm (tuber placed at 10 cm depth), it was found that potato yield under drip irrigation system (with fertigation) was equal to 43.1 t/ha compared to furrow irrigation system (30.9 t/ha). This yield advantage of 39.5% under the drip irrigation system was supported by 2.48 Benefit: Cost Ratio against 1.98 for furrow system. In addition, irrigation water saving up to 50%, higher dry matter contents of potato tubers (resulting in superior quality), 10-15% higher number of tubers (making the system further better for seed multiplication), 20-25% higher processing grade tubers (creates an opportunity of getting still better prices for selling raw material to processing industry), 25% fertilizer economy (saving farmers’ money and beneficial to the environment) and 30-35% labour economy were also reported in the scientific literature. Duly standardized agronomic requirements for application of micro-irrigation technology to potato in India by the ICAR-Central Potato Research Institute, Shimla, is another great added advantage in the direction of its large-scale adoption.
