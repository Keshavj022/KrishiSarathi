 The excreta of the poultry birds which is a very good sources of nitrogen was used as compost in the crop field. In addition to this, the poultry birds during scavenging consumed insects from the vegetable field and checked the insect load of the crop and thus reduced crop damage. Production practice and economics of horticultural crops under IFS Livestock units had contributed immensely to the income but it was also seen that horticultural crops had also contributed to the income of the farmers. As the area is rainfed, the crop chosen by the farmers were only Cattle unit under IFS Poultry unit under IFS Indian Farming January 2022 25 farm yard manure was added to each pit. Seedlings and suckers were planted in the middle of the pit. Organic mulching with dry leaves was done to retain moisture and control weed. The sucker came into bearing stage a year after planting and seedling came into bearing stage 3 years after planting. Sprinkler irrigation equivalent to 35-45 mm of rain at fortnight interval was done. The production of large cardamom was around 5.70 quintals per acre under IFS and gave a net income of ` 63122 having B:C ratio of 1.70. Economics of ginger crop Disease free planting materials were procured from the village. 40-50 g of each having one or two buds were taken for sowing in February. At the time of planting, well-decomposed farm yard manure or compost @ 40-50 t/ha, neem cake @ 2 t/ha, biofertilizer (Azospirillum + PSB) @ 5-6 kg/ha were applied in rows. It was harvested in the month of November. Rhizomes to be used as planting material were harvested after the leaves became completely dry. IFS shows that it gave a gross income of ` 53480 and net income of ` 22880 having B:C ratio of 1.75. Table 1. Economic analysis of livestock units under IFS Livestock Nos.

Economics of large cardamom crop Large cardamom is a high value perennial spice crop. Planting was done in June-July. Pits of 30 cm× 30 cm×30 cm were prepared with a spacing of 1.5 m×1.5 m. The pits were left open for weathering for 15 days, then 3 kg of well decomposed those which could be grown in rainfed condition. The yield, gross expenditure, gross return, net income with B:C ratio of different crops under IFS are shown in details (Table 2). Moreover, the vegetable wastes cleaned before marketing were used as fodder for livestock and also used in vermicompost. Economics of seasonal vegetables crop Vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, pea, carrot, leafy vegetables, tomato, spinach beans and coriander leaves were cultivated round the year in a small plot of land.
