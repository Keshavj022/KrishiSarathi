 Experiment It was found that 18 per cent of grain was infested with pest in case of control and 11 per cent in case of ITK whereas only 2 per cent infestation occurred in chemically treated seeds after four months of storage (Table 2). Ninety five per cent seed germination was recorded in chemically treated seeds, 80% in control and 82% in ITK practice. CONCLUSION On the basis of the findings of the study conducted for 4 months, it may be concluded that use of fingermillet cobs is effective in control of storage pests. However, better effect was observed when the seeds were stored by using parathion dust. GRAIN/SEED STORAGE Code : 1462 Title of the ITK : Mora - a grain-storage structure Description of the ITK : Mora is a storage structure in which grains of rice, wheat, marua (finger millet), etc. are stored for a long time. It protects grains from moist air and water. It also protects grains from rodent and storage insect pests. Its size and capacity varies from 0.1 to 2.0 t. Farmers of Mundatoil Kurpani village of the Thaitanger block in Simdega district (Jharkhand) use mora to store grains for seed purposes. Mora is made by binding the heap of grains from all sides with the help of straw made rope. Mora is used as storage for the last several years without any modification made by the users.
