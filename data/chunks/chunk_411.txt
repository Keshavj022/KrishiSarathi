 Piglet anaemia Piglet anaemia is caused by factors such as low body storage of iron in piglets, low iron content in sow’s milk, and a lack of contact with iron from the soil. The condition is characterized by roughness of the hair coat, loss of pigmentation in the mucus membranes, conjunctival pallor, listlessness, drooping of the head and ears, lack of appetite, diarrhoea, reduced weight gain, and dyspnea in severe cases. The following measures can be implemented to control and prevent piglet anemia: A single iron dextran injection (200 mg I/M) can be administered to piglets 3-5 days after birth. Iron sulfate paste can be applied onto the sow’s teat every 2-3 days. Iron licks/blocks and oral formulations can be provided to ensure an adequate intake of iron. treatments to address potential parasite burdens and ensure optimal growth and development. When it comes to coccidian (Eimeria spp.) infections, special attention should be given, particularly during the monsoon period, which typically occurs from June to September. During this time, the warm and humid conditions facilitate the survival and proliferation of coccidian parasites. Table 1 presents management schedule for endoparasites. Diarrhoeic faeces on the perineum of a piglet Pneumonia Causative agents, including Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica and Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, etc., are responsible for pneumonia. Signs and symptoms can vary depending on the presence of different pathogens. Cough, breathing difficulties, open mouth breathing, discharges from the nose and mouth, cyanosis, decreased feed consumption, and reduced growth rate/feed conversion are some common signs and symptoms. Affected animals should be segregated and treated with proper veterinary consultation. Pneumonia and other respiratory problems in pigs can be prevented by avoiding Conjunctival pallor in an anaemic piglet Endoparasites and their management Endoparasites are a common concern in pig farming, with several notable species that can affect the health and productivity of the animals. Among the most prevalent endoparasites in pigs are Ascaris suum, Strongyloides spp., Strongyle spp., Trichuris suis, Eimeria spp., Balantidium coli, and Cryptosporidium spp. It is recommended to deworm all breeding stock before breeding and administer deworming treatment to gilts and sows prior to farrowing. This proactive approach helps prevent roundworm infections in piglets as it reduces the transmission of parasites from the mother to offspring. Additionally, weanling and growing pigs should undergo one or more deworming Ascaris suum (adult) and Strongyloides sp. (egg) Table 1.
