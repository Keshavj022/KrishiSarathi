 In our analysis, we find that working more extended hours in agriculture, or in other words, the rising opportunity cost of women’s time, is associated with a reduction in nutrient intake in terms of calo­ ries, proteins, fats, iron, and zinc. Using first of its kind, detailed 10-month time use data for both women and men across seasons, we first show that women dispropor­ tionately bear the work burdens, as they work in agriculture and are solely involved in domestic work, food preparation, and care-related Table 4 Effect of opportunity cost of time on daily nutrient intakes of women per day (N = 8,002).

Women who have not participated in agriculture at all across 10 months are excluded from the sample. Standard errors are clustered at the household level. Significance levels: + 0.10, * 0.05, ** 0.01, *** 0.001. The control variables include daily market prices of rice, wheat, onions, potatoes, spinach, tomatoes and pigeon pea. a dummy variable for sickness of children, and a dummy for sickness of others in the household. Season dummies control for seasons and type of day as well. 1 Minimum Dietary Diversity Score for women (MDDW) Table 5 Effect of opportunity cost of time on daily nutrient intakes of women by cropping pattern.
