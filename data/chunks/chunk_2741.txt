 11 re- poned genetic transformation of two Indian genotypes of cotton using shoot apices from 3 to 5-day-old seelliings. In the present study, we attempted to transform an elite In- dian genotype of G. hirsutum by regenerating Agrobacle- rium-treated shoot apical meristems as described by Gould et 01.') with minor modific.ations. The modes of explant preparation ilnd regeneration differ in these re- pons. In our study the explant was bisected venically and shoot regeneration occurred from the shoot apical meris- tern. The transformation efficiency was very low (0.2%) in contrast to 60-70% reponed earlierlO • Transformation effidency was calculated based on pbysical presence of the tran!'.gene a!> analy!'.ed by peR and its expression by ELISA and not on the number of kanamycin-resistant shoots. The shoot apex explantl; infected with Agrobaclerium and incubated on the selection medium gave rise to shoots in four weeks.

Analysis by PCR to detect the presence of nplII and crylAc genes showed that twelve plants were positive (data not shown). However. these plants were chimeric in nature. The results were supported by observations made using Xpress immuntxliagnostic strips and Quan-T ELISA. The transfonnation frequency is thus very low (0.2%). The positive plants were carefully nurtured in the glass- house and seeds were collected from the bolls set from the selfe<! flowers.
