 The economy of state is predominantly based on rainfed agriculture (only 1/3rd of gross cropped area is being irrigated) and the major crops are paddy, wheat, maize and sorghum among cereals, chickpea, pigeon pea, blackgram and greengram among pulses, soybean, groundnut and mustard among oilseeds and cotton and sugarcane among commercial crops. Horticulture crops like potato, onion, garlic, along with fruits like papaya, banana, oranges, mango and grapes are also grown in the state of Madhya Pradesh. In some parts of the state medicinal crops and narcotic crops are also cultivated. Madhya Pradesh is contributing significantly in the food basket. The agriculture of the state is characterized as small holder agriculture (average size of holding is 2.02 ha) and nearly 29.16 per cent of total 15060557 holdings are small (< 2 ha) where the dissemination of modern agricultural technologies like farm mechanization is challenging task. As per 2004- 05 poverty census, around 37 per cent of total rural population is Below Poverty Line in the state. Low literacy (35.45 per cent), undulating topography, large waste land (13.2%), under developed irrigation potential (23%), low ground water utilization, large proportion of rain fed agriculture, practice of Kharif fallows (3.6%), moderate cropping intensity (143 %), low fertilizer consumption (50 kg/ha), high proportion of low value crops, and high population of low productive live stock are the major constraints of the state. 296 State Specific Strategies for Doubling Farmers Income - 2022 As per NSSO (2014), the average monthly income (Rs.) per agricultural household was Rs. 6210 for the agricultural year 2012-13. The farm’s income targeted both in real terms and nominal terms as Rs. 1, 16,788 (base year: 2015-16 & at 2015-16 prices); Rs. 2,30,999 (Terminal year: 2022-23 & at 2015-16 prices) and Rs. 3,25,039 (Terminal year: 2022-23 & at current prices). This is very challenging and painstaking efforts to make such drastic change in the farmers’ income facing the climatic, marketing and policy variations. The strategy document has focused on all these areas through suitable technological and policy intervention to achieve these targets at farmer’s level.
