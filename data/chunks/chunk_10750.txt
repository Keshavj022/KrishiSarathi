Cucurbits   Cucurbits planting may be completed by April end using FYM and Fertilizers (NPK @ 100:50:60 before sowing with Nitrogen in 3 split doses at 30, 45, 70DAT.   For fruit fly management, install Palam Fruit Fly traps @ 25 traps per ha in May and use Malathion 30 ml + Gur 150 g per 15 L water at 15 days interval.   Use bavistin 1g + Mancozeb 45 2g per litre of water for management of fungal diseases and imidacloprid @ 0,5 ml per litre for the management of sucking pests. Cole crops   Transplanting of cole crops in high areas can be started in the month of June using NPK @ 125:75:70 at the time of sowing with Nitrogen in 3 splits (30, 60 90DAT).
