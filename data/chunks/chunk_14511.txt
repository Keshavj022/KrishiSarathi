 Since both parts of this ratio are expressed in the same currency, IBI may be used to compare directly farming households in different countries in a unit of cents/dollar. IBI is proportional to household land per capita (LPC) and Eq. (1) simplifies to LPC/365. IBI ( cents dollar ) = ( 1 $/ha/year*100 365 days ) household size (persons) *cropped area (ha) (1) 2.2.2. Personal daily incomes from farming (FPDI) We estimated FPDI in US$ day−1 from the annual profitability values per hectare reported for rice and wheat production by households for each observation (Eq. (2)). To allow for international comparisons of income measures and comparison against the international poverty line, we converted the input and sales costs to PPP$ by using a conversion factor of 18.10 INR-PPP$ as reported by the World Bank for 2018. Subsequently, we calculated the value of total production by multi­ plying self-reported yields in t/ha with the reported farm gate price in (PPP$ t−1). We treated the full net value of production as income since farmers would have to purchase grains for a similar price if home con­ sumption were absent, thus neglecting factors such as additional costs associated with commercial value chains, price fluctuations in time, and quality differences to maintain parsimonious analysis. We also used the IBI to calculate the crop-specific personal daily calories available (in kcal day−1) from total production per ha using an average value of 2800 kcal kg−1 for rice and 3340 kcal kg−1 for wheat (D’Odorico et al., 2014). FPDI = [(yield*farm gate price ) −input cost ]*IBI (2) We then approximated profits by subtracting input costs in PPP$ ha−1. Since our dataset does not contain full cost of production infor­ mation, we approximated FDPIs by using key cost of production values (machinery, seed, labor, and fertilizer). For fertilizer, we multiplied the amounts of fertilizers that individual surveyed farmers reported to have applied with its typical costs per kg (Urea PPP$ 0.9; DAP 1.06 PPP$). For Table 1 Overview of descriptive summary statistics for key variables. Landholding, irrigation frequency, fertilizer cost, and yield are raw input data. Other variables were calculated for each household as described in the Methods section. Source: Household Data (see Section 2.1 for details).
