 ‘Three-way matrix sampler’ for seed genetic purity assessment and a method thereof has been patented and available for commercialization. • Alternative sites for hybrid seed production identified in field crops viz. paddy, sunflower, sorghum, maize, pearl millet, pigeon pea and castor. • Exposure of pigeon pea seeds to 40 oC for 24 h effectively attenuate the ill-effects of early heat stress in pigeon pea resulting in seed yield enhancement up to 18.8 per cent over control. • DNA based protocols (conventional PCR and RT-PCR) developed for detection of seed borne pathogens (BCMV in common bean and PMMV, C. truncatum, C. coccodesin capsicum). • Technology for effectively removes Karnal bunted seeds in wheat. • Excellent seed testing and seed processing facility accessible for local seed growers. • Dedicated seed sale counter for farmers and capacity building and input distribution.

Mandate and activities • Basic and strategic research to improve productivity and quality • Coordination and development of improved production and protection technologies for sustainable production • Providing the genetic diversity through pre-breeding and accelerate the breeding cycle through offseason nurseries • Surveillance and forewarning for management of diseases • Dissemination of improved technologies, capacity building and development of linkages 3. Salient achievements • Development of new high yielding varieties with better disease resistance and improved quality under All Indian Co-ordinated Project (AICRP) on Wheat and barley. • A total of 500 Wheat varieties and 104 barley varieties were developed and more than 300 Genetic stocks got registered for various traits. Among these varieties 4 varieties (WB2, DBW187, DBW 303, DDW 48) were bio-fortified. Industrial use varieties viz., DDW 47: Pasta; DBW 168: Biscuit; DWRB 160-Malt barley were also developed. • Five wheat varieties DBW 173, DBW 187, DBW 222, DBW 252, DBW303 and two barley varieties DWRB 160, DWRB182 got licenced and generated total revenue of Rs. 4,49,20,240 during 2018-2021. A total of 711 licences (MoAs) were signed with private seed growers. • Varietal Replacement Rate of 82.73 % was achieved and first time, ICAR-IIWBR varieties came under top 10 DAC top indented lists (DBW 187-Ist rank, DBW303-2nd rank & DBW222-7th rank). The IIWBR wheat variety DBW 187 has a spread of 5.00 million hectare.
