 Climate Services 30 (2023) 100358 4 Discharge capacity of the main canal is 65 m3/s. The capacity of the reservoir at the maximum water level is 928.89 Mm3. There is a minor power generation (16 MW) also from the reservoir, from two power houses of 8 MW each, on both sides of the main canal offtake point. The tailrace of the left powerhouse discharges to the Lower Bhavani canal and that of the right discharges to the Bhavani river. The river upstream of the dam serves as a source for domestic and industrial users in parts of Coimbatore and Tirupur districts outside the Bhavani basin. Further­ more, two canal systems originate from weirs in Kodiveri and Kalin­ garayan (Fig. 1). The Kodiveri weir serves two canals: Thadappalli on the left and Arakkankottai on the right. Together, these canal systems irrigate a total area of 16,300 ha of which 6400 ha is outside the basin. The system boundary in this research consists of the Bhavani basin as well as the part of command that is outside the Bhavani basin (Fig. 1). The LBIP, which began shortly after India’s independence, was the first major irrigation project in Tamil Nadu state (Lannerstad, 2008). The basin receives an average rainfall of 1037 mm annually (1971–2018), with a standard deviation of 238 mm. Major share of the rainfall is received during the North-east monsoon season from October to December (43 %), South-west monsoon (June-September) contributes 35 %, 18 % is contributed by pre-monsoon (March-May) showers whereas only 4 % of the rainfall is received during post monsoon season (January-February). There is an east–west gradient of rainfall in the basin (Fig. 2); Eastern part of the basin receives an annual rainfall less than 750 mm, whereas the western side receives more than 1400 mm of rainfall annually. In the central part of the basin, rainfall received is in the range of 950–1050 mm. Similar range of rainfall is received in the South-western side close to the Palghat gap. Mean maximum and min­ imum temperature are 29.6 ◦C and 19 ◦C respectively, with April being the hottest month and January being the coolest. The average relative humidity ranges from 29 % in the summer (May) to 91 % in the monsoon (July-August), and the average potential evapotranspiration is around 5.8 mm/day. The basin covers three districts – The Nilgiris, Coimbatore and Erode. About half of the population in Erode district depends on agriculture as their livelihood option. LBIP commands an area of approximately 83,700 ha. The main canal is approximately 200 km long, with three main sub-canals departing at 53, 101 and 131 km. The total length of the distributaries is 1120 km, with field channels running for a total of 1920 km. Irrigation is provided to the command area in two turns by dividing the entire command area into two zones of equal area (Table 1). The first turn lasts from 15 August to 15 December and the second turn from 16 December to 15 March.
