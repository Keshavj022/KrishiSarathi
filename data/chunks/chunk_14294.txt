 For winter wheat, a fertilizer dose of 120 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, and 40 kg K2O ha−1 was applied until 2013–14, and subsequently increased to 150 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, and 40 kg K2O ha−1. Mustard received a basal dose of 90 kg N, 40 kg P2O5, and 30 kg K2O ha−1. Chickpea was fertilized with 30 kg N, 40 kg P2O5, and 40 kg K2O ha−1 at seeding. Irrigation was applied to ensure stress-free growth, with CA plots receiving 45–50 mm and CT plots receiving 60–65 mm of irrigation water, during a normal year. For additional details on agronomic practices such as weeding, residue management, as well as soil and weather properties, Parihar et al. (2016) can be referred. 2.3. Yield and economic observations As part of long-term experiment, comprehensive soil property and crop biometric observations were collected at regular intervals. Crop productivity and economic data of particular interest for the risk-return tradeoff analysis were obtained as follows. At maturity, crops were harvested at specific heights: 15 cm above ground for chickpea, 20 cm for wheat, 35 cm for mustard, and 40 cm for maize. Grain/seed and straw/stalk yields of wheat, mustard, and chickpea were estimated from randomly selected 2.0×4.0 m2 (8.0 m2) harvested areas from each plot using a plot thresher (with straw/stalk amount reduced by 30 % left on the ground). Maize cobs and stover were harvested from a 10.72 m2 area (central 4 rows constituting 4 m length with row spacing of 0.67 m) and threshed using a maize plot sheller to estimate grain yield (with stover amount reduced by 30 % left on the ground). Grain/seed moisture content was determined using a grain moisture meter and adjusted to ~14 %, 12 %, 12 %, 12 %, and 10 % moisture content for maize, wheat, chickpea, mungbean, and mustard, respectively. Economic analysis considered only variable production costs, including human labor, ma­ chinery usage (tractor, plough, planter, etc.), input costs (seed, fertilizer, herbicide and pesticide), irrigation, harvesting, threshing, loading/ unloading, and transportation to the market. Land value and other fixed cost like machinery use was not considered in the analysis. The gross return was calculated by multiplying the total productivity with mini­ mum support price fixed by government of India. Net return or profit­ ability (NR) was calculated by subtracting total variable production costs from gross returns. The productivity data of kharif maize was used to build target yield and profit/net return frontier for kharif season, whereas the rabi/winter season crop return and system return derived from the respective yield were used to derive the profit frontier for rabi/ winter season and cropping system, respectively. We analyzed each season separately and as well as at cropping system level too, because for some farm only one season can have more priority over other. The soil properties of respective plots can also be obtained from Parihar et al. (2016). 2.4.
