04 Haemato-biochemical profile: Packed cell volume (PCV), serum total protein, albumin (A), globulin (G), A: G ratio, chloride, sodium and potassium were estimated from the blood samples collected on days 0 and 6 post treatment. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Etiology of diarrhoea: For etiology of diarrhoea at IVRI, E. coli was isolated from 69% of faecal samples. The rest cases of diarrhoea could be attributable to other bacterial, viruses and non-infectious causes in the absence of specific tests. None of the calves was found to suffer from parasitic diarrhoea due to routine deworming programme at the farm. Results of etiological investigation conducted at GBPUAT are given in Table 3. E. coli followed by toxocariasis were the predominant causes. C. Proteus vulgaris D. Salmonella typhi Fig. 3. In vitro antimicrobial profile against (Clock-wise) 1.

The result Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi. In this showed that the values of different haemato- study only mild anti-microbial activity against biochemical parameters improved markedly to Staph. aureus could be recorded. No antimicrobial almost normal level by day 3 in animals of Gr II, activity was recorded against other bacteria. whereas the animals of Gr I still continued to pass Therapeutic efficacy of bael fruit: Results of loose faeces and had mild depression and experiments conducted at IVRI are presented in dehydration by day 3. Thus, the calves of Gr II Tables 4-6. had a faster recovery than those of Gr I, indicating The diarrhoeic calves of Gr II that received significant supportive therapeutic effect of bael bael-ivuii powder (ITK) together with standard powder in diarrhoea. These results are in antibiotic treatment showed better improvement conformity with those of the previous year. Table 4.
