 The agri-horti-silvi-pastoral system produced 6.64 tonnes REY (rice equivalent yield). The highest REY of 3.01 tonnes was estimated with cow milk followed by capsicum–french bean–pea (0.62 tonne REY). Economic analysis indicated gross return of ` 82,611 from the system while net return of ` 41,612 was obtained from one cow dairy unit. Vegetable component registered a net income of ` 7,068 amounting to a total net income of ` 32,113 from the system. Integrated organic farming system model: An integrated organic farming system (IOFS) model was developed for lowland valley ecosystem to utilize all the resources available on- and off-farm effectively and, to improve the income. The IOFS model comprised enterprises such as cereals (rice and maize), pulses (lentil, pea), oilseeds (soybean, rapeseed), vegetable crops (French bean, tomato, carrot, okra, brinjal, cabbage, potato, broccoli, cauliflower, chili, coriander, etc.), fruits (Assam lemon, papaya, peach), dairy unit (a milch cow + calf), fodder crops, central farm pond, farmyard manure pits and vermicomposting unit. The total cost of cultivation was ` 56,835/year for an area of 0.43 ha while Response of sowing date of irrigated wheat to amount of rainfall during crop growing stage in the mid-Himalayas RESEARCH FOR TRIBAL AND HILL REGIONS DARE/ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2019–20 136 total net return was ` 73,903/year. About 94.3% of the total N, 81.2% of the total P2O5 and 98.2% of total K2O requirement could be met within the model itself. ISLAND AND COASTAL REGION Coastal region Goa Dhan 3 (Goa Rice Selection 1): Goa Dhan 3— a selection from the saltol QTL introgressed rice lines received from International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines was recommended for cultivation in the salt-affected coastal saline soils of Goa state. The variety is white-kernelled semi-tall type with long-bold grains, with an average yield of 3.0–3.5 t/ha under stress and up to 6.0 t/ha under normal condition. Goa Dhan 4 [JK 238 (Jyothi × Korgut)]: A red- kernelled long-slender grain type, high-yielding, salinity tolerant rice variety Goa Dhan 4 (cross between Jyothi × Korgut) suitable for cultivation in the coastal saline soils and rainfed shallow lowland ecology of Goa was developed. Its average yield is 3.0–3.5 t/ha under stress and up to 5.5 t/ha under normal condition. Brinjal: Bacterial wilt resistant brinjal varieties, viz. Goa Brinjal 1, Goa Brinjal 2, Goa Brinjal 3 and Goa Brinjal 4 were released for the state of Goa. The yield of Goa Brinjal 1, Goa Brinjal 2 and Goa Brinjal 4 were 27.5 t/ha, 20.5 t/ha and 25 t/ha, respectively. Okra: The Goa Bhendi 1, is derived from pure line selection from local accession from South Goa. Fruits are seven ridged, hairy, long (20–22 cm) and tender with less fibre. Each plant produces around 9–11 fruits in 75 days duration with 7–8 t/ha yield. The fruit is highly palatable and preferred by consumers.
