 The isotopic signatures of the archaeobotanical remains from Sanganakallu-Kupgal should reflect its semi-arid envi­ ronment, while those from the East Indian coast should reflect a wetter environment. Moreover, since the all three East Indian sites are syn­ chronous and similar in their archaeology, the isotopic signatures should reflect a similar agroecology for the crop remains. Lastly, Paithan, with its excavated irrigation channels and fully urban nature, is expected to demonstrate farming strategies such as high-yielding, irrigated rice paddies that catered to a larger population compared to the other, earlier sites. 3. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of archaeobotanical assemblages: direct insight into farming conditions Stable isotope analysis of archaeological human and faunal remains is a widely exploited method of exploring aspects such as diet and mobility. However, stable isotope analysis of well-preserved charred archaeobotanical remains to understand agricultural strategies has only been recently used in novel studies in parts of Europe and South-west Asia (e.g., Fraser et al., 2011; Bogaard et al., 2013; Wallace et al., 2013, 2015; Bogaard, 2015; Styring et al., 2016a, 2016b; Bogaard and Arbogast, 2016; Bogaard et al., 2016; Nitsch et al., 2017; Styring et al., 2017), and remains unexplored in South Asia. Reconstructing past agroecologies using stable isotope analysis provides direct evidence of crop growing conditions, and enables us to track changes in agricultural strategies through time and space. The carbon isotope patterning in living organisms is largely linked to isotopic fractionation associated with the photosynthetic pathway of the plant. In C3 plants such as wheat, rice, barley, and pulses the stable carbon isotope value is influenced by stomatal conductance, which in turn is determined by water status (e.g., Araus et al., 1997; Wallace et al., 2013). C4 plants such as millets and maize are arid-adapted (Sage and Monson, 1999) and therefore their stomatal conductance, and in turn the stable carbon isotope values, are not determined in the same way by water status (e.g., Ellsworth and Cousins, 2016; Lightfoot et al., 2019). Additionally, carbon isotope values can be impacted by salinity, altitude and variety/landrace (e.g., Yousfi et al., 2009; Lightfoot et al., 2019), and the suite of environmental effects can be complicated to fully parse out, especially in archaeobotanical grains where a high number of unknowns exist (Araus et al., 2007, 2013; Wallace et al., 2015; Flohr et al., 2019; Jones et al., 2021). While deliberate anthropogenic watering cannot be directly distin­ guished from natural sources of water, we can infer selective watering through comparisons between different species (e.g., Araus et al., 1997; Wallace et al., 2013). The stable carbon isotope values can be expressed as carbon discrimination, or 13C (Farquhar et al.
