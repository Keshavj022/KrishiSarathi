The average yield during first, second, third and fourth year is approximately 2.5, 3.0, 3.0 and 3.5 tonnes per hectare, respectively. The average price of the stevia leaves is considered as `90 per kg in the current study. The B:C ratio of stevia cultivation is 1.86 indicating the huge potential to improve the livelihood of stevia farmers by means of high profitability. The low payback period and high B:C ratio indicate the projectâ€™s financial feasibility and potential for sustainable returns over crop period. SUMMARY Sweet essence of stevia has been discovered long back and it is being promoted globally as a sugar substitute crop. However, stevia is still not in the main stream cultivation practices in India as cultivating stevia represents a dilemma for Indian farmers because of lack of awareness, improper guidance, high initial input cost, unavailability of adequate planting material/varieties and inappropriate processing procedures despite its huge profitability potential with B:C ratio of 1.86 indicating the economic viability of the stevia cultivation and its positive returns compared to the costs incurred. The cumulative total cost steadily decreases from the first year to the fourth year, with the project exhibiting a positive Average Annual Net Return of approximately `1,24,947.75. The payback period is estimated at around 2.15 years. However, various public and private institutes are offering quality planting materials, training, awareness programs and consultation for stevia farming and also it is approved by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India for use as an artificial sweetener in various foods. So, it offers a vast scope for commercial cultivation and processing in India in order to boost the income of the farmers and agrarian economy as a whole. *Corresponding author email: srinathtn.vk18@gmail.
