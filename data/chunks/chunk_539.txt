SUMMARY In integrated farming system, agriculture can be integrated with livestock, poultry and fish maintained at same place to generate employment around the year and also get additional income. It provides a holistic approach towards effective use and management of farmlands to even the small and marginal farmers who face the challenges of not being able to invest in agriculture technology. It provides an effective alternative to the conventional methods of farming with its focus on development of alternate sources of income for such families and generation of resources for the community. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: kailash.kumawat@shiats.edu.in TERMS AND CONDITIONS RTGS/NEFT Payment Details: Journals/Magazines Name and Address of the Organization Project Director, DKMA Bank Name Canara Bank Bank Address Pusa, New Delhi 110012 IFSC Code CNRB0019029 MICR No. 110015391 Current Account No. 24133050000040 Research Journals • The Indian Journal of Agricultural Sciences (English monthly) • The Indian Journal of Animal Sciences (English monthly) ` 1,000 US$ 160 ` 3,000 US$ 450 ` 1,000 US$ 160 ` 3,000 US$ 450 For Individuals For Institutions Please accept my subscription amount of Rupees (`)/US Dollar ($) ....................................... for the Magazine(s)/Journal(s) tick (√) marked above.
