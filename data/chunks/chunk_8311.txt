 Treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene enhanced the green life of pre-climacteric bananas for four months at 14oC and for 15 days at ambient temperature over the untreated controls without any adverse effects on physiological, biochemical and qualitative parameters. Banana (Grand Nain) hands of 46, 48 and 50 calliper size (mm) dipped in Trichoderma asperellum (prr2) and packed without ethylene absorbent extended shelf- life up to 75 days at 13.5°C. There was no incidence of anthracnose and crown rot as compared to control banana hands packed with ethylene absorbent (50 days) and control (17 days). Banana products: Banana fruit juice and central core stem based jellies were developed by blending fruit juice or stem juice with sugar and citric acid. It contains 65oBrix TSS and 0.2% acidity which were highly accepted at hedonic scale rating. Banana central core (stem) juice based squash contains 45oBrix TSS content and one per cent acidity. Banana central core (stem) juice based syrup, soup mix and ice cream mix were developed with high level of consumer acceptance. Grape wine: Grape wine prepared from cv. Cabernet Sauvignon using ß-glucosidase producing yeast strains VSI-1106 and SPR was found to contain higher quantities of several aroma compounds including 13 aroma compounds produced by ß-glucosidase positive yeast strains. The aroma compounds 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)- 1,3-Cyclohexadiene (lemon aroma) and Benzeneacetaldehyde (floral and honey aroma) were present only in wines produced by yeast strain SPR whereas propanoic acid, 2-methyl-, 1-Nonanol and 1- Decanol compounds were uniquely present in wines prepared with yeast strain VSI 1106 and are related to release of fruity aromas. Extending storage of litchi pulp: Litchi pulp pasteurized and treated with 1500 ppm potassium metabisulphite (KMS) was acceptable in quality and colour up to 10 months storage at low temperature (6±1 °C). Litchi flesh pre-treated with 50 °Brix osmotic sucrose solution in the pulp solution ratio of 1:2 gave highest overall acceptability (7.96) with minimum hardiness (2749.52 g) and drying time (15 hr.) after 9 months of storage. Three blending ratio, i.e. 25% sweet cherry+ 75% sour cherry, 50% sweet cherry + 50% sour cherry, 75% sweet cherry + 25% sour cherry with 100% each of sweet and sour cherry with and without treatment of 0.1% Sodium Benzoate and stored at 4±2° C were studied. After six months of storage, it was observed that blend of 50% Sweet cherry + 50% sour cherry treated with sodium benzoate retained desirable quality attributes like brightness, redness and freshness to maximum when compared with other blending combinations. Three blending ratio, i.e. 25% apricot + 75% plum, 50% apricot + 50% plum, 75% apricot + 25% plum with 100% each of apricot and plum juice with and without treatment of 0.
