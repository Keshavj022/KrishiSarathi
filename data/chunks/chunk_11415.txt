2 m width and length as per convenience may be prepared. Application of pre-emergence herbicide pendimethalin @ 0.2% is recommended to control weeds in nursery. About 5-7 kg seeds treated with thiram @ 2 g/kg are required to raise seedlings for one hectare. Application of 20-30 tone FYM/ ha one month before transplanting and mixed in the soil. The recommended dose of nutrients is 100 kg N, 50 kg P and 80 kg K/ ha. The whole quantity of phosphorus, potash and half quantity of nitrogen should be mixed in soil before transplanting. The remaining half nitrogen should be given in top dressing equal quantity in two split doses at 30 days and 45 days after transplanting. Close planting at 15 cm between rows and 7.5 cm between plants is most conducive for high yields. Application of 15 kg sulphur/ha on soils sulphur level above 25 kg/ ha while 30 kg sulphur/ha is needed for soils having sulphur level below 25 kg/ha for optimum production of onion. If not controlled thrips properly can cause yield loss up to 50%. If infestation observed in field, spray of Fipronil (Regenta)@30 ml/15lt water or Prophenophos@ 10ml /10 lt. water by 8-10 days interval. Maggots’ infestation observed in January-February Month. Its control by spraying Chlorpyriphos @2 lt /acre along with irrigation water or sand. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 153 Severe infestation of purple blotch and stemphylium blight may cause yield loss up to 70%. Spray of Propineb 70%WP@350 gm/ acre/150 lt of water, twice at 10 days interval is sufficient. The germination of the onion can be checked by storing at 300 C for 9 days after 72 73 harvesting with this technology we can store onion at room temperature for three months. Tomato Tomato is a warm season crop. The best fruit colour and quality is obtained at a temperature range of 21-24°C. Tomato can be grown on a wide range of soils from sandy to heavy clay. However, well- drained, sandy or red loam soils rich in organic matter with a pH range of 6.0-7.0 are considered as ideal. Azad T-3, Azad T-5, Azad T-6, Kashi Amrit, Kashi Anupam, Kashi Sharad, Kashi Visesh, Pusa Hybrid 8, Pusa Hybrid 4, Pusa Uphar, Pusa Hybrid 2 About 100-200g of seeds are sufficient for raising seedlings for one hectare of land. The seedlings with 5-6 true leaves are ready for transplanting within 4 weeks of sowing. For hybrid varieties, recommended dose of fertilizer per hectare is 180 kg N, 100 kg P2O5 and 100kg K2O. Half dose of N, P & K are given at the time of transplanting. Remaining quantities of top dressed 30 days after transplanting. A third dose of 60 kg N is applied 50 days after transplanting. To control spread of whiteflies, uproot, and destroy affected plants. In case of severe infestation, take spray of Triazophos@250ml/200litre or Profenophos@200ml/200litre of water. Repeat the spray after 15 days. Thrips is a very Common pest and mostly seen in dry weather.
