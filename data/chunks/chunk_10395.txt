 Frequent detection of H5N1 infections in north eastern and eastern regions (sharing borders with Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Myanmar) indicates a regional cross-border problem with porous borders and illegal movement of poultry and poultry products contributing to the threat of potential endemic circulation within the region (Dhingra et al. 2014). Unlike other countries, India is continuously experiencing a frequent outbreak of the HPAI H5N1 strain (DAHD 2015). A survey report on poultry economics in West Bengal (Otte et al. 2008) indicated that economic impact through losses largely Indian Agriculture after Independence 250 exceeds the monetary support provided by Govt. and therefore, there is little incentive for farmers to report infection, which compromises the efÔ¨Åciency of passive surveillance. It has been observed that the initial introduction of HPAI to a country is usually associated with long-distance transmission from infected areas through migratory birds (Newman et al. 2012). The massive border migration involvement in northeastern and eastern regions must be controlled with stringent border security measures. An amount of Rs. 26.44 crore has been paid from february 2006 to 23rd march 2020 as compensation to poultry farmers on account of culling due to avian influenza based on each outbreak. Series of outbreaks till 2009 cost the poultry industry a loss of Rs.30 crore. To date, 32 outbreaks occurred with two H5 serotypes that resulted in the death and culling of 4.36 and 87.24 lakh birds, respectively. Nevertheless, no such scientific and organized study has been conducted in India regarding the economic loss incurred due to the avian influenza outbreaks in poultry concerning each outbreak that happened between February 2006 to March 2020. India adopted stamping out protocol as the main strategy for the control of AI. ICAR-NIHSAD, Bhopal has made a tremendous effort in timely and accurate diagnosis of high and low pathogenic avian influenza in India, since the occurrence of the first outbreak in 2006 in the country. Some of the notable diagnostic achievements include development of avian influenza antibody detection ELISA kit, multiplex real-time RT-PCR kit for avian influenza A virus typing, and H5 and H9 subtyping and Lateral Flow Test for rapid detection of H5 avian influenza virus antigen in poultry. Important milestones in AI and other poultry diseases are mentioned in Table 8. Table 8. Milestones in poultry health improvement Year Milestone 1945 Ranikhet disease vaccine (R2B Mukteswar strain) developed. 1946-47 Fowlpox vaccine developed. 1953 Ranikhet disease vaccine (F strain) developed. 1959-60 Fowlpox vaccine (Egg adapted) developed. 1999-2001 Development of IBD vaccine. 2000 Preparedness for avian influenza diagnosis initiated. 2001 ICAR-NIHSAD recognized as national referral facility for avian influenza by DAHD, Govt. of India. 2009 ICAR-NIHSAD recognized as international avian influenza reference laboratory by OIE.
