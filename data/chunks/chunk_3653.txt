In case of vegetables, the annual rate of growth of production of vegetables is found to be higher than that of the per annum growth rate in the area under cultivation in the states of Meghalaya, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura. While the areas under cultivation and production are relatively stable in Meghalaya and Tripura, they are found to be moderately stable in Nagaland and Sikkim. Favourable agro-climatic conditions in Meghalaya and Tripura offer tremendous scope for the cultivation of a wide variety of vegetables throughout the year. Improvement in irrigation facilities through the introduction of drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, protected cultivation of vegetables, provision of modern farm implements and tools, and other facilities to the farmers under the Technology Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture have enabled the states to make remarkable progress in the production of vegetables. Despite a decline in the annual growth rate in the area under production by 0.65% in Arunachal Pradesh, the state has recorded an increase of 6.
