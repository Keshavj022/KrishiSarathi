 To address these challenges, BAU is working closely with governmental agencies, private sector players, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to expand digital infrastructure and increase farmers’ access to these transformative tools. Looking ahead, continuous innovation in digital technologies and the active involvement of policy makers will be crucial to scaling up these initiatives. With ongoing support, BAU’s digital horticultural ecosystem has the potential to become a model for the entire Eastern Indian region. Strategies for promoting digital initiatives in eastern India To modernize horticulture, establishing a Digital Pineapple plantation monitoring through drone Horticulture Knowledge Hub is essential, alongside leveraging mobile applications for farmer support and implementing remote sensing and IoT technologies. Promoting digital literacy among farmers and developing e-market places for horticultural products will facilitate seamless trade and knowledge access. Digital payment solutions should be introduced, supported by virtual advisory and extension services to enable real-time assistance. Utilizing data analytics for predictive insights and promoting collaborative platforms for knowledge sharing will further empower farmers. Strengthening digital infrastructure in rural areas is critical, with block chain integration to ensure traceability and transparency. AI-powered crop management tools can optimize farm operations, while cloud-based farm management systems and online training via webinars will support skill development. Virtual reality can be utilized for demonstrations and training, while digital marketing for horticultural products enhances market reach, completing a robust framework for a digitally-enabled horticulture sector. SUMMARY The digital initiatives pioneered by Bihar Agricultural University are revolutionizing horticulture in Eastern India by integrating cutting-edge technologies into farming practices. Through tools such as video conferencing, mobile applications, IoT, drones and social media; BAU is empowering horticultural farmers to make informed decisions, improve productivity and access markets. These efforts are not only enhancing horticulture farmers’ livelihoods but also contributing to the sustainable development of the sector. BAU’s digital strategy serves as a blueprint for the modernization of horticulture sector across the region. For further interaction, please write to: Dr D. R.
