 Therefore, all forms of agro-biodiversity needs to be collected through regular explorations, conserved through suitable means, characterized and evaluated using modern technologies to ensure their availability for improvement programmes of food and agriculture today and tomorrow (Mohapatra 2016). In addition, conservation of agro-biodiversity is vital to increased productivity, food security, robust and stable farming systems, and ecosystems. Traditional communities, particularly women, have played a significant role in the conservation of traditional varieties, especially in fragile agro-ecosystems. The role of women and these communities need to be acknowledged and appreciated through rewards while implementing on-farm conservation strategies. In view of the relevance of agrobiodiversity in the evolving global scenario, there is a need for creating awareness and understanding among the public and Indian masses. The literacy crusade for conservation and sustainable management of agro-biodiversity needs to be undertaken at grassroot level, starting right with school and gram sabha/ panchayat levels. Also, conservation of available breeds/strains of animals, fish and microbes need urgent attention. Most of the developing world looks towards India for suitable models for agrobiodiversity conservation, management, and use. The country is well poised for adopting a lead role within the developed world, being well equipped with institutional support and human resource needed for generating improved technologies. Issues/ problems related to agro-biodiversity, ecology, and rural development could be easily solved by studying, accepting, and following Gandhian philosophy and practices.

Introduction Soil, water and vegetation are the basic natural resources providing a base for food, nutritional and environmental security. Land, soil and water are the abiotic resources, whereas natural vegetation and wildlife are the biotic resources. India shares 2.4% geographical area and 4% fresh water resources of the world but it supports 16% human population and 18% livestock population. Both biotic and abiotic resources are exhaustible in nature. At present, the country is confronted with widespread land degradation, over-exploitation of groundwater resources, impaired soil health and contamination of soil and water resources, abiotic stresses etc. About 120.7 million ha (Mha) of total geographical area (36.5 % of total geographical area) of the country is affected by various kinds of land degradation comprising of water erosion (82.6 Mha), wind erosion (12.
