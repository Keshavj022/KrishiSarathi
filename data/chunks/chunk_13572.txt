 Results and discussion The amount of input used for each crop is greatly influenced by the many cultivation techniques used, such as weeding, crop protection, irrigation management, intercultural, planting, harvesting, and on-farm transportation. 3.1. Energy input pattern of major crops In order to calculate the energy input-output integrating factor and energy use efficiency (EUE), human and animal labor hours, machine labor hours, power and fuel intake, farm-yard manure, crop protection chemicals, and seeding rate (per hectare basis) were translated into energy values. Utilizing the corresponding coefficients, the crop-wise total physical performance per hectare, which includes both the pri­ mary product and the by-product, were translated into energy output (Table 3). The sugarcane energy input was noted to be significantly highest (59.23 GJ ha−1) owing to it being a perennial (12 month) crop occu­ pying maximum area throughout the year (Table 3). Amongst other seasonal crops, paddy had inputted the highest energy at 37 GJ ha−1), while the least energy was realized to consume by maize valued at 18.94 GJ ha−1 (Table 3). The proportion of each input to the total energy input corresponding to each crop is displayed in Fig. 1. For wheat, maize, sugarcane, and paddy, it was calculated that the energy required for fuel (diesel) combustion made up a significant amount, accounting for 7 to 63% of the overall energy input. However, it was shown that, energy usage from fuel (diesel) was found to be greatest in cotton, followed by wheat and maize. This is so because, in the case of cotton, most infield operations are automated and powered by machines. Similar findings were revealed regarding cotton farming in Iran, where the majority of the energy input was attributed to diesel fuel consumption (47.4%), followed by chemical fertilizers (19.8%), with the remaining energy input coming from sources such as electricity (5.3%), seeds (3.7%), human labor (3.2%), farmyard manure (3%) and chemicals (2.3%) [59]. In terms of energy input, fertilization accounted for about 12–37% of the overall energy input for seasonal crops, which was the second greatest proportion. Electricity used for irrigation was discovered to be the second most energy-intensive input, specifically for paddy, requiring 47% of the overall energy input. By using 324 kg ha−1 N, 19 kg ha−1 P in paddy, 214 kg ha−1 N, 144 kg ha−1 P in maize, 325 kg ha−1 N and 143 kg ha−1 P in wheat, and 280 kg ha−1 N and 55 kg ha−1 P in cotton, Table 2 Greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) coefficients of various agricultural inputs.
