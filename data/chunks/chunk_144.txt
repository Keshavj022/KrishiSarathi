 The modern youth are not attracted towards farming due to the hard work and drudgery involved in it. The implications of drones may fascinate and encourage the youth towards agriculture, as drones enable farmers to have a better understanding of their fields. With the help of drones, farmers can produce more food while using fewer chemicals. Almost all farmers who have made use of drones have achieved some form of benefit. They can make more efficient use of their land, exterminate pests before they destroy entire crops, adjust the soil quality to improve growth in problem areas, improve irrigation for plants suffering from heat stress and track fires before they get out of control. Therefore, drones may become a major part of agriculture in the future by helping farmers manage their fields and resources in a better and sustainable way. But high initial costs and policy reforms are two difficult obstacles to overcome, to make it popular and farmer-friendly. Despite the limitations, these tools and technology are expanding rapidly with their use in agriculture by providing information about farming. *Corresponding author email: tushar.athare@icar.gov.in Outreach Programmes of KVKs (2018-19 to 2022-23) Training Activities of KVKs (2018-19 to 2022-23) Seed and Planting Materials by KVKs (2018-19 to 2022-23) 0.35 0.41 0.37 0.32 0.37 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 OFT (in lakh) 1.83 2.04 1.95 2.17 3.76 0 1 2 3 4 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 FLD (in lakh) 13.06 13.51 16.82 15.76 16.9 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 Farmers trained (in lakh) 1.14 1.21 1.16 1.51 1.41 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 Extension Personnel trained (in lakh) 1.67 1.77 1.76 1.7 1.86 4.69 4.2 2.87 3.49 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 Seed produced (in lakh quintal) By KVKs 459.49 365.53 348.01 436.99 490.97 0 100 200 300 400 500 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 Planting material produced (in lakh) therefore, requires a dedicated team to be available for the planning and execution of drone demonstrations. SUMMARY Drone technology has a lot of potential for efficiently carrying out a variety of agricultural tasks. The modern youth are not attracted towards farming due to the hard work and drudgery involved in it. The implications of drones may fascinate and encourage the youth towards agriculture, as drones enable farmers to have a better understanding of their fields. With the help of drones, farmers can produce more food while using fewer chemicals. Almost all farmers who have made use of drones have achieved some form of benefit. They can make more efficient use of their land, exterminate pests before they destroy entire crops, adjust the soil quality to improve growth in problem areas, improve irrigation for plants suffering from heat stress and track fires before they get out of control.
