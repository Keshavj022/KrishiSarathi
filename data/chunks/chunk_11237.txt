 Excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer encourages multiplication of insect pests and diseases hence should be avoided. yy To control Zinc deficiency, apply 60 kg of zinc sulphate heptahydrate (21%) or 40 kg zinc sulphate monohydrate (33%) per hectare at puddling in case previous crop in this field had shown the symptoms of zinc deficiency. Where the deficiency is noticed in the growing crop, apply this quantity of zinc sulphate as soon as possible. Weed management: yy Apply Bensulfuron methyl + Pretilachlor (Londax power) @ 10 kg/ ha at 7-8 days after transplanting, application of post-emergence herbicide (e.g., bispyribac-sodium (25 g/ha)/ penoxsulam (25 g/ ha)/ azimsulfuron 30 g/ha/ fenoxaprop (with safener) (60g/ha)/ metsulfuron (4g/ha) + fenoxaprop (60 g/ha) can provide effective weed control in transplanted rice. 73 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS Scented/Basmati Rice yy For Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) of Basmati, Pusa Sugandh-4, Pusa Sugandh-5, Ballabh Basmati 22, Malviya Sugandh 105, Malviya Sugandh 4, Malviya Basmati 10, and Pusa Basmati 1509 are most suitable varieties. The optimum sowing time for Basmati under DSR is the first fortnight of June. yy Apply 135 kg urea per hectare in three equal splits at 3, 6, and 9 weeks after sowing. Phosphorus and potash should be applied only if the soil test shows the deficiency of these nutrients. Skip phosphorus application if the recommended dose of phosphorus had been applied to the preceding wheat crop. yy For Basmati varieties like Pusa Sugandh-4, Pusa Sugandh-5, Ballabh Basmati 22, Malviya Sugandh 105, Malviya Sugandh 4, Malviya Basmati 10, and Pusa Basmati 1509, the optimum time of nursery sowing is 1st fortnight of June and transplanting time is 1st fortnight of July whereas, for CSR 30 (Soil having pH>8.5), Basmati 370, Basmati 386, Pusa Basmati 1509, the optimum time of nursery sowing is 2nd fortnight of June and transplanting time is 2nd fortnight of July. yy Seed and seedling treatment is mandatory to control dreaded diseases like foot rot. Smear the seeds with talc formulation of Trichoderma harzianum@ 15 g per kg of seed immediately before sowing and seedling root dip for 6 hrs with T. harzianum@ 15 g per litre of water before transplanting. Seedlings of Basmati varieties are ready for transplanting when they attain 5 to 6 leaf stage or are 25- 30 days old. yy Irrigate the nursery before uprooting and wash them to remove mud. Transplant two-three seedlings per hill in lines at 20 x 15 cm (33 hills/sq. meter) during the optimum period in a well-puddled field. In the late transplanted crop, the spacing may be reduced to 15x15 cm (44 hills/sq. meter) to minimize the reduction in yield. yy Practice green manure before basmati. Do not apply urea if the field has been green manured with 45-55 days old sunnhemp/dhaincha 74 ICAR KHARIF AGRO-ADVISORY FOR FARMERS or summer moong straw has been incorporated after picking of pods. yy Apply fertilizers on soil tests and crop rotation basis.
