 Pre-winter snowfall November snowfall-2018 and 2019: During 2018 (2nd to 4th November) and during 2019 (7th November), the early and unprecedented snowfall caused extensive damage to orchards in particular apples across the Kashmir valley, thousands of trees observed mechanical damage in nearly entire Kashmir. The damage was more severe where fruits in some varieties were not completely harvested from trees. This damage was not confined to 2019 only but has hit apple production in the forthcoming years as well. This is the fifth time since 2000 (2004, 2008, 2009, 2018, and 2019), when Kashmir valley recorded snowfall in the month of November. However, during 2019, Kashmir registered its heaviest snow in November in about 40 years. Snowfall records of the past four decades-monitored by the Meteorological Department showed that 9.6 cm (4 inches) equivalent snowfall was recorded between 6 and 7 November 2019 in Srinagar which is the heaviest 24-hour snowfall recorded in November since 1980. In Kashmir valley, around 1,58,150 hectares of land is under apple cultivation and most of the orchards are on seedling rootstocks and it takes around 10-15 years of investment of a grower to come to full production potential. About 10-40 and 20-50% damage to orchards was seen in a different part of the valley due to November snowfall during 2018 and 2019 respectively. The damage was higher in the Southern district i.e. Kulgam, Shopian, Pulwama, and Anantnag during 2018. Why untimely snowfall is harmful to trees or how it affect fruit growers? Mechanical damage: Leaves were still on trees at the time of snowfall during the first week of November as in apple, pear, peach, cherry, plum, apricot, etc. Leaf senescence process starts in the second half of November and by the first week of December, trees shed their leaves. With leaves still on trees, every snowflake accumulate on leaves and put weight on branches-thus severely damaging them. Furthermore, this unexpected snowfall was heavier than normal snowfall which resulted in more destruction. Trees were uprooted, developed major cracks in stem and several trees suffered broken branches. Being an evergreen fruit crop, olive suffered the most drastic damage whereas, the leaf senescence process was already started in almond and walnut and most of the trees had shedded around 60% of leaves. But because of the brittle nature of wood and dense canopy (pruning not started), almond observed severe damage next to olive in ICAR- CITH, Srinagar. However, due to the strong nature of wood and spare canopy, walnut escaped from any major mechanical damage. The two-year-old feathered nursery plants of apple were also severely damaged/uprooted due to untimely November snowfall. Loss of fruit: The fruit of some apple varieties was still on trees at the time of snowfall. Snowfall not only damaged apples that were on trees but led to severe fruit drop.
