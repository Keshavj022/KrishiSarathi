For identifying the target genes and the molecular mechanism of virulence a consistently virulent isolate ESR-01 of S. sclerotiorum was sequenced. The filtered high-quality paired-end (PE) and mate-pair (MP) reads of 23,191,545 and 11,569,965, respectively, were de novo assembled into 328 scaffolds with an N50 scaffold size of ~ 447.13 kb. The assembly resulted in a total size of 40.98 Mb with an overall coverage of 129X. Total 9,469 protein-coding genes with an average length of 1,587 bp were predicted from the whole genome assembly. Functional annotation revealed that 9,412 genes had homologous sequences in NR (non-redundant protein) database, whereas the remaining 57 genes were unannotated. Further, 156 genes essential for the pathogen-host interactions were also identified and of these 30 were found to be novel effector genes. Eleven effector candidates were validated experimentally through expression profile of the ESR-01 isolate of S. sclerotiorum. The study led to better understanding of the S. sclerotiorum genome, secretome, and its effector repertoire which will help in refining the present knowledge on S. sclerotiorum- Brassica interactions and necrotrophic lifestyle of the phytopathogen.

Seed production Breeder seed production: During 2022-23, total breeder seed production of more than 2,000 varieties of 58 field crops was 1,02,786.8 q against the indent of 66,091.3 q. The major share in total breeder seed production is of cereal crops, i.e. 54,566.1 q against indent of 30,022.9 q.

In case of oilseeds, total breeder seed production was 31,717.7 q against the indent of 25,760.4 q. Breeder seed produced in case of fiber crops was 131.8 q against the indent of 96.7 q; 687.7 q breeder seed was produced in forage crops against the indent of 616.3 q.
