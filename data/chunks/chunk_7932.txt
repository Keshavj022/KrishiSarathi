 oryzae (Xoo), causal organism of bacterial blight (BB) and resistant lines were utilized in crossing programme. 100 microbial cultures have been accessioned including some cyanobacterial strains received from DBT-Institute of Bioresources and Sustainable Development, Imphal, Manipur. Two bacterial species namely Delftiat suruhtensis and Klebsiella varicola have been introduced for first time into the collection. NAIMCC has supplied more than 70 cultures of bacteria and fungi to different private and government institutions for research purposes. Recently, NAIMCC has started receiving cultures for accessioning under safe deposition to fulfil the requirements of registration of biopesticides through CIB (Central Insecticide Board) and RC (Registration Committee) and from other researchers for some other specific purposes. Horticulture Fruit crops: A total of 55 accessions in banana, 20 in citrus, 13 in grape, 23 in guava, 29 in jackfruit, 12 in litchi and 44 in mango were added to the existing germplasm collections at different centres. In banana, Belgium, an exotic introduction from the Philippines, was found promising under Indian condition. In grape, germplasm was strengthened by importing four trait-specific accessions from USDA, USA. These accessions are self-thinning and early-ripening. IC number was allotted to 118 accessions, thus increasing the number of accessions with IC number to 416. Further, 100 grape accessions were characterized for 35 traits. Maximum variation was observed for 100- seed weight, bunch compactness and juice content. Several accessions with bold berries, loose bunch and high fruitfulness were identified. Among 100 accessions, 11 were found to have loose bunch and five accessions had naturally bold berries. In apple, 13 genotypes were assessed to identify and determine the alternate bearing index (ABI), based on quantitative evaluation of alternation. Medium alternanace was shown by Gala Mast, Vance Delicious, Firdous, American Apirouge, Mollies Delicious and Oregon Spur with ABI values of 0.28, 0.33, 0.36, 0.40, 0.41 and 0.44, respectively. Cultivars Starkrimson, Cooper-IV, Golden Delicious, Silver Spur and Red Chief are susceptible to alternanace with ABI values of 0.52, 0.54, 0.61, 0.62 and 0.68, respectively. High degree of Micronutrient analysis to identify high Zn and/or Fe donors in wheat: A set of 500 landraces were screened for their grain iron and zinc concentration. The lowest amount of grain Zn (34.7 mg/kg) was found in landrace IC 5324457 and the highest was found in the landrace, IC 59587 (85.2 mg/kg). The lowest grain iron was observed in the land race, IC 118744 (30.4 mg/kg), while the highest Fe in grains was observed in IC 82250 (69.9 mg/kg).
