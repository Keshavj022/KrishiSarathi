 AN thanks the School of Archaeology (University of Oxford), the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art (Uni­ versity of Oxford), St. Peter’s College (University of Oxford), Utkal University, and Deccan College Post Graduate and Research Institute for Fig. 4. Average δ15N values of archaeobotanical samples plotted through time. The dotted lines refer to thresholds of low, medium, and high manuring in cereals as reported in Bogaard et al., (2013). Fig. 5. Average Δ13C values of archaeobotanical samples plotted through time. The dotted lines follow the schematic from Fig. 2, i.e., ‘L’, ‘W’, and ‘B’ represent the ‘poorly watered’ threshold for lentil, wheat and barley respectively, as determined by Wallace et al., (2013), and those labelled ‘D’ and ‘E’ indicate the average reference values obtained from the experimentally charred modern Deccan and Eastern rice.
