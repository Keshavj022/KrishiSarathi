The potential wheat equivalent yield of rainfed soybean–wheat cropping system through FYM and VC were 10,730 and 10,950 kg/ha, which could be achieved with application of 58.3 and 57 kg P/ha, respectively. These yield levels were 32 and 34% higher than the recommended NPK, respectively. The level of P required from FYM and VC to achieve the same yield level as recommended NPK for rainfed soybean–wheat cropping system were only 13.1 and 12.2 kg P/ha, respectively, which were very less compared to 24 kg P/ha (mean of 34.9 and 13.1 kg P/ha under recommended P through SSP for soybean and wheat crop, respectively). The level of N required from FYM and VC to achieve the same yield level as recommended NPK for soybean–wheat cropping system were only 58 and 54 kg N/ha, respectively. The level of FYM and VC on fresh weight basis required to achieve the same yield level as recommended NPK for rainfed soybean-wheat cropping system were only 14.7 and 8.8 t/ha, respectively. Soil enzyme activity index: Soil enzyme activity index (SEAI) was developed to provide a single comprehensive unit-less value. Sustainable yield index (SYI) and SEAI of rainfed soybean–wheat cropping system were evaluated after 44 years with different nutrient management. Addition of 10 t FYM/ha with recommended NPK provided 24, 187 and 83% higher SEAI, sustainable yield index of soybean (SYI-S) and wheat (SYI-W) compared to the application of recommended chemical fertilizer only.
