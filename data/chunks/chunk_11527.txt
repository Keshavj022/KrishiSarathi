 To protect the nursery from severe cold, cover the nursery during evening hours with polythene sheets or polywoven Urea bag sheets supported by steel rods or bamboo sticks and remove the sheets during morning. To correct zinc deficiency, spray Zinc Sulphate @ 2g per liter of water. Spray a combination of Carbendazim + Mancozeb 2g/ kg of Urea whenever application of Urea is there. Irrigate the field during evening hours and drain the water in the morning. To control Blast in Rabi rice nurseries, spray Tricyclazole @ 0.6 g per liter of water. To control Stem borer, spray Cartap Hydrochloride 50 S.P @ 2 g. or Chlorantriniliprole @ 0.3 ml per liter of water. To control Leaf folder, spray Cartap hydrochloride @ 2 g. per litre of water ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 366 To control Rice whorl maggot, spray Fipronil (5 SC) @ 2.5 ml per liter water or apply Cartap Hydrochloride granules @ 8 kg per acre. If False smut noticed, spray two times, Propiconazole @ 1 ml or Carbendazim 50 WP @ 1 g. or Tebuconazole + Tryfloxystrobin 75 WG @ 0.4 g. per litre of water once at heading stage and again one week after first spray. To control Panicle mite, spray Dicofol @ 5ml + Propiconazole @ 1 ml or Spiromesifen @ 1 ml + Propiconazole @ 1 ml per litre of water. To control Neck blast, spray Tricyclazole @ 0.6 g. or Isoprothiolane @ 1.5 ml or Kasugamycin @ 2.5 ml per litre of water. Spray again with an interval of 10-15 days based on severity of incidence and prevailing environmental conditions. If Sheath blight is noticed, spray Hexaconazole 5 E.C or 5 S.C @ 2ml or Propiconazole @ 1 ml or Tebuconazole @ 1 ml + Tryfloxystrobin 75 WG @ 0.4 g. per litre of water two times at an interval of 15 days. Maize Recommended time of sowing October to November. In rice fallow maize zero tillage system, up to December. Use Medium duration (DHM 117, DHM 119, DHM 121, Bisco 855, Bio 9637, Karimnagar Makka 1, JKMH 4848, Karimnagar Makka and Short duration hybrids (DHM-115, Pioneer 3342, KH 5991, DKC 7074 for profitable yields. Time of sowing Yasangi: October to November. In rice fallow maize zero tillage system, up to December is preferable. Fertilizer requirement: 80-100 kg N, 32 kg P2O5, 32 kg K2O per acre is recommended. Nitrogen may be applied in four splits viz., at sowing, knee high stage (30-35 DAS), at flag leaf emergence (50- 55 DAS) and at tasseling-silking stage (60-65 DAS). Apply 20 kg of Zinc sulphate per acre for every 2-3 seasons. If symptoms appear later, the crop can be sprayed with 2 g/l solution of Zinc sulphate. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 367 Four to six irrigations are needed during the Yasangi season. Two irrigations up to flowering at an interval of 20-25 days, one at the time of flowering, two after flowering and one at the early grain filling stage. If five irrigations are given, one irrigation at the vegetative stage may be avoided and if only four irrigations are given, one irrigation after the dough stage may be avoided.
