   In case of Long duration varieties apply 58 k neem coated urea + 250 kg SSP + 45 Kg MOP per ha at basal and 58 kg neem coated urea + 23 kg MOP per ha at 30 DAP as topdressing and another 58 Kg neem coated urea at 50 DAP   In case of short duration varieties apply 44 kg neem coated urea + 190 kg SSP + 34 Kg MOP per ha at basal and 44 kg neem coated urea + 17 kh MOP per ha at 25 DAP as topdressing and another 44 Kg neem coated urea at 45 DAP   Adoption of green manuring technology through Dhaincha cultivation in the field about 70 days prior to the transplanting in the main field and ploughing down for decomposition about 2-3 weeks before transplanting can improve the soil fertility and reduce the requirement of urea fertilizer.   Before sowing, treat rice seed with mancozeb + carbendazim 2gm or Trichoderma viridae 10gm by dissolving in 10-12 ml water per kg seed; make paste of fungicide solution and rub on the seed. Maize (Kharif)   Different varieties like, Vivek -27 (very short); Parkash, X 3342 (short); Malviya hybrid, Makka 2, AH-58 (medium) and All-Rounder, 900 M Gold, Pro 311, Bio 9681, Seed Tech 2324 as long duration may be used   Complete the sowing operation 12-15 days before the full onset of monsoon i.e Last week of June to First week of July.   For better yield maintain plant to plant spacing 25 cm and row row spacing 75 cm.   seed with mancozeb + carbendazim 2gm or Trichoderma viridae 10gm by dissolving in 10- 12 ml water per kg seed; make paste of fungicide solution and rub on the seed to avoid the infection from the diseases like Leaf Blight, Banded leaf, Sheath Blight etc.   Follow the raised bed planting technique as it is best than conventional method (ridge and furrow), specially in rainy season.   Apply 10 to 15 ton FYM per ha, 10-15 days prior to sowing . ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 73   Apply 450 kg SSP, 120 Kg MOP and 7.5 Kg Znso4 (Zinc Sulphate) per ha as basal Apply Urea in five splits as follows- 67 Kg at the time of sowing (Basal), 82 Kg at four leaf stage, Blackgram (Kharif)   Small and Marginal Farmers should cultivate Blackgram in the rainfed, monocropped, upland or undulating land for better profitability and nutritional security than rice.   Sowing should be done at last week of August to 1st week of September when 1st phase of monsoon will be lowered down.   Suitable varieties like WBU-108, WBU-109, PU-31 should be sown @ 25 kg seed per ha   Apply 250kg of SSP and 35 kg of MOP at the time of final land preparation. No need of urea   Spray Zn EDTA @ 1g + B-20 @ 2 gm per lt of water at 20 and 40 DAS . Jute   JRO 204 (Suren) variety of jute seed and treat the seed with Carbendazim (Bavistin) 50 WP (2g per kg seed), at least 4 hours before sowing. If JRO 204 variety is not available then JRO 524, IRA, Tarun and NJ7010 variety can be grown for fibre production.
