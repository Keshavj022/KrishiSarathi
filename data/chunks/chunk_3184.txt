in 59 2002 ‐ 2007 • TM 99‐50 and BPMR 145 were most promising entries against powdery mildew. • Lamda Cyhalothrin (Karate 0.04%) alone and in combination with NSKE 5% (with half dose of Karate 0.02%) and Thiodicarb 0.04% proved higher effective against sucking pests and pod borer in mungbean. • IPM 99‐125 recorded resistance to both species of root ‐ knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica. • IPM module involving seed treatment with Dimethoate (5 ml/ha seed) + Carbendazim (2 gm/kg seed) + Removal of virus infested plant at 30 DAS + Foliar application of Chlorpyriphos (2.5 ml) + DDVP (1 ml) during flowering and pod stage was effective against pod borer complex and proved economical. • ML 1108 and Pusa bold 1 showed multiple disease resistance against YMV, leaf curl and CLS diseases. • SML 746 and TM 99‐37 of mungbean were found resistant to both the species of root knot nematode (Mjavanica and M. incognita). • Genotype TM 2000‐02 showed broad based resistance against powdery mildew. Rajmash • Foliar spray of acephate 0.04%, profenophos + cypermethrin 44 EC (1 lit.lba) or Endosulphan 0.07% proved effective against stemfly and pod borer damage in rajmash. Fieldpea • Seed treatment with Trichoderma viride has reduced wilt incidence in fieldpea by 50%. • Pea genotypes KPMR 640, DMR 47, IPF 2‐19 and KPMR 615showed multilocational resistance against powdery mildew. www.icar.org.in 60 Research Achievements of AICRPs on Crop Science All India Coordinated Pearl Millet Improvement Project 1.
