 Niger • Fertilizer dose @ 40 kg N + 40 kg P/ha recorded maximum seed yields when phosphours was supplied half as DAP/SSP + half as rock phosphate enriched with FYM. • Application of sulphur @ 30 kg S/ha with RDF and gypsum was the most suitable source of sulphur to enhance the seed yield. • Sowing with onset of monsoon and two hand weedings or one hand weeding at 30 DAS + dust mulch within and between rows, after weeding was most effective for in‐situ moisture conservation practice to get higher seed yields of niger under scare moisture conditions. • The most appropriate sowing time for pre‐rabi niger was 1st September with 3 irrigations. www.icar.org.in 87 2002 ‐ 2007 • One hand weeding at 15 DAS + vegetative mulch @ 4 t Iha was most effective for in‐situ moisture conservation practice to increase higher yield and GMR under rainfed conditions. • Pre‐emergence application of Pendimethalin + sieving was most effective for the management of CusGuta in niger to get highest seed yields and gross monitory return. Crop Protection Entomology SESAME • The IPM module ‐ resistant variety + Seed treatment with Trichoderma viride (0.4%) + Intercropping with moong bean/pigeon pea/urid bean + two sprays of Azadirachitin (0.03%) minimized the incidence of Antigastra and Dasyneura as compared to farmer's practice. • Combination of endosulfan 0.07% at 30 DAS + neem oil 10 ml/lit at 45 DAS was equally effective but economic and eco‐friendly as compared to both the sprays of endosulfan 0.07%. • Besides being economical and eco‐friendly, the efficacy of ITK involving Garlic buds + Red pepper (1:1) @ 5g/lit or Neem leaf extract in cow urine (250g neem leaf/lit cow urine kept for 10‐15 days) @ 30ml/lit or Cow butter milk @ 40 ml/lit (10‐15 days old) were as effective as endosulfan 0.07% (@ 2 ml/lit) for the control of leaf roller/capsule borer and bud fly. • Four sprays alternatively of NSKE 5% and endosulfan 0.07% or 3 sprays of NSKE 5% proved to be as effective as endosulfan 0.07% sprays to control leaf roller/capsule borer and bud fly. • Sesame + green gram (3:3) and sesame + cluster bean (3:3) intercropping systems minimized the incidence of leaf roller/capsule borer and bud fly. NIGER • Niger is profusely flowering, self incompatible plant with 100% entomophilous crosspollination. Very high seed yield of niger (1228 kg/ha) was recorded with one bee hive (Apis mellifera) per 600 sq. m in niger field. A yield reduction of 93 per cent was recorded in net covered control without any pollinators. An additional income of Rs. 252 to 2125 including Rs. 1015 /ha from honey was obtained through bee keeping with niger over open pollinated crop. PATHOLOGY SESAME • Seed treatment with Carbendazim 50 WP (0.1%) + Thiram (0.4%) or Trichoderma viride (0.4%) or T. harzianum (0.4%) or cow dung ash (0.4%) reduced the incidence of Macrophomina stem/root rot. • One spray of Mancozeb (0.2%) minimized the incidence of Alternaria leaf spot. Whereas one spray of Mancozeb (0.
