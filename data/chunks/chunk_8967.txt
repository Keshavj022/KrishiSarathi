 Self-propelled High Clearance Sprayer The Akola Centre of AICRP on FIM has carried out prototype feasibility testing of PAU self-propelled high clearance sprayer in cotton crop at the university farm in 12 ha and in 5 farmers’ fields in 16 ha. It was observed that the self-propelled high clearance sprayer could be easily operated in the cotton fields where the row- to-row spacing varied from 60 to 75 cm. The height of the crop was 65-110 cm. The boom height was adjusted according to the height of the crop, which varied from 0.85 to1.30 cm. The sprayer was operated at a system pressure of 5 kg/cm2, which could operate 16 nozzles giving a desirable spray to be deposited on the cotton. A swath of about 11 m was obtained during the spraying. The fuel consumption was 1.33 litres/ha. The volume of chemical solutions sprayed/hr varied from 176-200 litres/ha. The effective field capacity obtained was 2.52 ha/hr. During the spraying operation it varied from 2.15 to 2.89 ha/hr. The cost of operation varied from Rs 50.90 to Rs 68.40/ha. Self-propelled high clearance sprayer can achieve a time saving of 98.10% and a saving in cost of 82.27% when compared with manually- operated knapsack sprayer. Lowland Rice Seeder The TNAU, ANGRAU, and IIT Centres of the AICRP on FIM carried out prototype feasibility testing of the manual pre-germinated rice seeder in farmers’ fields. Large-scale farm trials were conducted to assess the performance of lowland rice seeder in comparison with transplanted rice and broadcasting method.Grain yield was higher in the case of rice seeder at most of the locations. The TNAU, Coimbatore and IIT, Kharagpur Centres of AICRP on FIM covered 133 and 100 ha area on farmers’ field under prototype feasibility testing, respectively under large scale-testing. The field capacity of the device at 3 Centres varied from 0.08 to 0.14 ha/hr. The average field efficiency was 75%. The initial cost of the machine is Rs 2,500 and its cost of operation is Rs 600/ha. The machine is commercialized at TNAU Centre and 227 units sold. The ANGRAU, Hyderabad and IIT, Kharagpur Centres have also commercialized the unit.
