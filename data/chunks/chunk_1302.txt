 As the global population continues to rise, alongside increasing food demands and industrialization over the past century, the emphasis on maximizing productivity has become a primary goal in agricultural practices. However, this pursuit has led to environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, and heightened concerns regarding food security. Additionally, current agricultural challenges include stagnating growth, declining crop yields, increased food insecurity and malnutrition, reduced arable land, climate change, and groundwater depletion, all contributing to rising input costs, diminished income, and higher unemployment rates. Enhancing productivity may serve as a crucial solution for ensuring food and nutrition security for a growing population. This involves the implementation of scientific agronomic practices and technologies aimed at increasing the productive capacity of conventional agricultural systems. Therefore, Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) represent a multidisciplinary, holistic approach that effectively addresses the challenges faced by small and marginal farmers. Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) are recognized as eco-friendly, cost-effective, and farmer-friendly, blending traditional knowledge with modern technology to support adoption based on specific situational needs. The integration of various enterprises, facilitated by a bottom-up and adaptive approach, culminates in IFS was adapted under The Farmer FIRST Programme in PAU, Ludhiana. The primary goal of IFS is to establish resource development and utilization practices that lead to substantial, sustained agricultural production. By systematically integrating various components such as crops, trees, livestock, and fisheries, IFS can fulfill the diverse needs of farm families, including provisions for food, fodder, fruits, fibre, fuel, and small timber, thus presenting a holistic solution. Integrated farming system for farmers An analysis of the economic performance of an IFS model for six farmers, consisting of four primary components viz. crops + dairy (2 buffaloes) + kitchen gardening is given in Table 1. The crop component, established on an area of 4000 m² per farmer, exhibited varying levels of net returns, reflecting differential productivity and cost-efficiency in this traditional rice- wheat cropping system. The other crops occupying 500 m² enhance crop diversity within the farm, thereby contributing to increased economic returns. Notably, Indian Farming 74 (10): 06-09; October 2024 Indian Farming 7 October 2024 Farmer 6 exhibited the highest net returns in this component, indicating optimized input management or the cultivation of higher-value crops. The dairy component, managed through the upkeep of two buffaloes per farmer, provided substantial gross returns primarily from milk production, with Farmer 1 achieving superior net returns, potentially due to advanced dairy management practices or favourable market conditions.
