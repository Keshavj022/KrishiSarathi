 4 seeds are sown per pit and later 2-3 seedlings per pit are retained   General recommendations for requirement of Manures and fertilizers are FYM @20-25t /Ha, N@100kG/Ha, P@50Kg/Ha, K@50Kg/Ha   It can yield 100-150 Qntl / Ha depending upon the variety and time of plant   Spraying with 0.05% malathion or dusting with 5% malathion dust @ 10 kg/ha. For control of Red pumpkin beetle ICAR agro-advisory for KHARIF 2022 105   Spray Dinocap(0.1%) or Wettable sulphur (0.2%) or Calixin (0.5%) 2-3 times at 10 days intervals after disease appearance, Spray Mancozeb (0.2%) at 8-10 days interval for disease like powdery mildew and anthracnose disease.   Brinjal (Var.: Pusa Purple Long &Round) .   Well drained , fertile, sandy loam soils with a pH of 5.5-6.6 are best suited for its cultivation   The requirement of fertilizers depends upon the types and condition of the soil. FYM @20-30t /Ha, N@100-120 Kg/Ha, P@75 – 85 Kg/Ha, K@45 - 50Kg/Ha, Boron @20-25Kg/Ha   Highly vigorous and late bearing varieties are given wider spacing compared with dwarf, upright and early types. 60 x 45cm,60x60cm,75 x 60cm. Seed requirement: 200g/Ha   Brinjal is a long duration crop, it is good yielder in soil of good fertility. Heavy yields are obtained with better management practices. Healthy and stocky seedling which are free from disease and shoot and fruit borer infestation having 3-4 leaves are transplanted   Yield varies according to the region, cultivar and duration of crops Early variety : 25 – 30t/ha Hybrid : 35-50t/ha Tomato   Indeterminate tomato varieties namely Solan lalima, Arka Samrat, ArkaAbhed and ArkaRakshak are recommended for Kharif season.   Nursery bed should be prepared by first week of May. Bring the soil into fine tilt and raise the bed to 10-15 cm above ground level. Mix well rotten farmyard manure/ compost or leaf compost in the soil. To make the soil free from soil-borne disease causing pathogens (Damping-off), drench the bed with 0.1% solution of Captan or Fytolan. Cover immediately with polythene sheet or gunny bag for 2 days. Uncover the soil and get it loosened and leave it as such for 3-4 days. Thoroughly mix Malathion 5% dust in order to protect the seedlings from soil-borne insects. Sowing should be done by second week of May. Sow the seeds thinly in U-shaped furrows spaced at 2.5 cm and at a depth of 1-2 cm (4 times the diameter of the seed). Cover the seeds immediately with a thin layer of sand mixed with well dried and sieved farm yard manure.   Pit should be prepared and FYM should be applied 15 days ahead of transplanting. Liming should be done earlier to transplanting to raise the soil pH to optimum level. Pit should be treated with insecticide before transplanting of plants. Pit should be prepared at a spacing of 75 x 30 cm (Row to row x Plant to plant).   Seedlings are ready for transplanting 21-30 days after sowing (second or third week of June).
