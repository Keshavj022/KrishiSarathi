 In field pea incorporate organic matter @ 200 q ha- at the time of land preparation and apply 55 kg of urea, 313 kg of SSP and 42 kg of MOP per ha as basal application at the time of sowing. In rapeseed, incorporate FYM or compost @ 50 q ha-1 at the time of land preparation. Under irrigated condition apply 54 kg of urea, 375 kg of SSP and 50 kg of MOP as basal dose at the time of sowing by placement method and again apply 54 kg urea at the time of first irrigation at three weeks after the sowing. In rainfed condition apply 50 % of the recommended dose fertilizer. In Linseed application of 87 kg of urea, 125 kg of SSP, 17 kg of MOP ha-1 along with FYM@ 20 q ha-1 as basal is recommended under rainfed conditions. Seed sowing should be done during the Second fortnight of October to first fortnight of November however in rapeseed sowing can be delayed upto last week of November. Before sowing pea seeds should be treated with rhizobium culture@ 50 g kg-1 seed, Bavistin @ 2 g kg-1 seed and Trichoderma viride @ 4 g kg-1 seed For Rapeseed and Linseed Seed treatment is done with Azotobacter and Phosphotika @ 40 g each/ kg of seed before sowing. At least two weeding should be done at 20 and 40 DAS. ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs 291 For enhancing yield through increased pollination, 5 honeybee colonies ha-1 is recommended to install in rapeseed. Insect pest management Clip aphids infested shoots or parts in the early stage. Collect and destroy the egg masses, grubs and gregarious early instar larvae in the cropped area. Install yellow and blue sticky trap @ 6 traps/acre at crop canopy level to monitor the sucking pest population Set up light traps @ 1trap/acre to monitor the emergence of adult moth population. In the early stage of infestation spray the NSKE or Neem oil @ 4% Spray Trichogramma chilonis @50000/ha or Spinosad @ 0.75ml/L of water in the initial infestation of Lepidopteran pests (caterpillars). If infestation of the leaf feeders/ caterpillars and borers are high spray anyone of the following insecticides, Indoxacarb 14.5 SC @ 0.5 ml/L or Emamectin benzoate 5% SG @ 0.4 g/L of water If the incidence of sucking pests persists (Aphids, Thrips, and bugs) spray anyone of the following insecticides, Imidacloprid 200 SL @ 0.5 ml/L or Thiomethoxam 25 WP @ 0.3 g/L or Spiromesifen 240 SC @ 0.5ml/L of water. Disease management Use certified seeds of resistant/tolerant variety. Burn infected pea stubble soon after harvest to reduce the disease. Avoid sowing pea in the same infected field. Follow crop rotation with non-leguminous crops and adopt mixed cropping. Spray Benomyl 50% WP @80g in 240 litres of water per acre. Second spray after 15 days interval. Or Sulphur 80% WG @750g-1kg in 300-400 litres of water per acre followed with second spray after 25 days of interval for Powdery mildew and Pea rust.
