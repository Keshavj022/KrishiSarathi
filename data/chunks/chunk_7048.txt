 IC0637548 21008 Resistance against BPH biotype 4 prevalent in India carrying the novel Brown plant hopper resistant gene BPH 34 from Oryza nivara acc. IRGC 104646 on rice chromosome 4. IC0637549 21009 Carries bacterial blight resistance gene from Oryza nivara acc. IRGC 81825 which gives complete resistance at the seedling and adult plant stage to Xanthomonas pathotype seven. The bacterial blight resistant gene Xa38 was mapped on long arm of chromosome 4 and STS marker was developed for marker assisted selection of the trait. GENETIC RESOURCES ICAR ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 25 (Contd...) Crop National INGR Novel (unique features) identity number IC0637550 21010 IET 19339 carries three bacterial blight resistance genes which gives complete resistance at the seedling and adult plant stage to Xanthomonas pathotype seven. Three bacterial blight resistance genes, xa5, xa13 and Xa21, were pyramided into cv. Pusa 44 using marker-assisted selection. EC670488 21011 Tolerant to high temperature stress (>35°C) at reproductive stage with very high spikelet fertility particularly under high temperature stress. IC0637551 21012 Tropical japonica based NPT line, which is a restorer of WA cytoplasm possessing the restorer gene, Rf4, developed in the background of a popular indica rice variety Pusa 44.
