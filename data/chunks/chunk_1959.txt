 Improved Crop Quality: Robotic harvesting and picking ensure gentle handling of produce, minimizing damage and preserving quality throughout the harvesting process. Selective harvesting and sorting capabilities enable robots to identify and harvest ripe crops, resulting in higher-quality yields and reduced post-harvest losses. Enhanced Sustainability: Agricultural robots promote sustainable farming practices by reducing the use of chemicals, water, and energy through targeted and precise application. By minimizing soil compaction and erosion, robots help preserve soil health and fertility, contributing to long-term environmental sustainability Applications of Agricultural Robots:  Precision Planting  Harvesting Robots  Autonomous Tractors  Monitoring and Sensing Robots  Robotic Dairy Farming 4.3. Remote Sensing and Satellite Imagery in Agriculture Remote sensing involves the collection of information about objects or areas without direct physical contact. In agriculture, it can play a pivotal role in monitoring and managing crops, soil, and environmental conditions. Satellites are a crucial platform for remote sensing applications. In agriculture, satellite imagery can provide a comprehensive view of large agricultural landscapes. Remote sensing and satellite imagery are integral components of precision agriculture, which can offer valuable insights for farmers and agricultural stakeholders. These technologies may contribute to data-driven decision-making, optimized resource usage, and enhanced overall farm management.
