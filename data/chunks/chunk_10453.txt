 The improving of productivity and sustainability shall involve adoption of new age tools of sensor technology that leads to improved precision and automation using robotics, drones and AI for quality production and postharvest operations. The agri-robotics, sensor technology, and artificial intelligence will have to be integral component of new agricultural engineering program. The tangible socio-economic impact of various mechanization and post-harvest technologies to farmers Achievements in Agricultural Engineering in Independent India 309 and other stakeholders also calls for more attention on these fields which somehow, took backseat in the past. It now requires focused efforts with greater allocations and spreads in manpower for fulfilling accelerated demands in very near future. The present farmers and farming want ease of doing operations, automation, efficient but cost effective agricultural tools, implements and machineries. The post-harvest sector is even challenging but full of opportunities. The agri-food system is needed to be considered in entirety rather than pieces. References Anonymous (2021) CIAE SPAD meter.
