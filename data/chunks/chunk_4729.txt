It commences flowering in September-October, matures in February-March and harvesting can be done in March- April under Tumkur conditions. This is a lean period in this region when there is less agricultural activity. The farmers can use this time to process and pack the tamarind to get better price in market. The pulp of “Lakshamana” is of superior quality having light brown colour, it is broader in shape which is desirable for marketing and has less fiber content. The inner cavity is silvery and this encloses the seeds. The pulp recovery is high (43%) as against 28% in local tamarind trees. Biochemical composition of promising selection identified The pulp of Lakshamana has been characterized for nutritional traits (acidity and sugars) and total acidity and total sugar was found to be 20% and 29.78%, respectively. It was also profiled for sugar through liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) and organic acid by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Glucose and fructose are the major sugars and account for 96.8% of the total sugar content. Beside that small amount (<1%) of mannose, ribose, arabinose, rhamnose, myo-inositol, sucrose and maltose were also found. Among organic acid tartaric acid content was highest (18.61%). Although tartaric acid occurs in other sour fruits, but tamarind fruits are reported to be the richest natural source of tartaric acid. Tamarind is known to be simultaneously the most acidic fruit with the sweetest taste because of presence of high levels of reducing sugars (glucose and fructose) and tartaric acid. Combination of organic acid and reducing sugar gives sweet-sour taste to this fruit. Table 2. Sugar and organic acid profile of Lakshamana S.

The tree has drooping architecture which makes harvesting easy. The pods fall down on own or the branches are shaken with help of long poles or a person climbs and shakes the branch to break free the pods. The pods are collected and left out to dry in sun for a few days. Processing which involves breaking the shell and removing seeds is carried out to secure better market value. One person can process 15-20 kg pods per day and earn around ` 400/day.
