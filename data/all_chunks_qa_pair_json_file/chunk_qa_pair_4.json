There is also a huge potential of earning foreign exchange through the export of quality grain and value-added products. The grain and nutritional quality of durum wheat varieties: HI 8663, HI 8713, HI 8737, HI 8759 and HI 8777, viz. grain protein content (>13%), high iron (>45 ppm), high zinc (>40 ppm), yellow pigment (>6 ppm) content is in comparison with Canadian and Australian durums, which makes Indian durum wheat highly potent for export. However, the availability of exportable durum is limited and due to the lack of gradation system for durum wheat, it gets mixed with bread wheat in local markets. Special grading system and strict policies by the government in the procurement of durum wheat and preparation of pasta products from durum wheat only can boost the Indian pasta manufacturing industries and durum wheat growers. SUMMARY Durum wheat cultivation is found to be highly profitable in central India due to varieties having high yield potential, rust resistance and high tolerance to drought and heat, which ensure more production with less irrigation. Around 13% of increase in durum wheat area was found in Madhya Pradesh compared to the durum wheat area in the last 5 years. With the rising demand from milling industries in and around Madhya Pradesh, farmers are increasingly taking up the cultivation of durum wheat. HI 8713 is a durum wheat variety with high yield, wider adaptability, high yellow pigment (7.16 ppm), good levels of essential micronutrients, and excellent dual quality grain with high levels of resistance to stem and leaf rust. Quality traits, viz. high hectolitre weight, less gruel, generate 10 question answer pairs in json format\" }",
